Ceramic works by Margit Kovács
The sculptor and ceramicist, Margit Kovács (1902-1977), was one of the leading figures in modern Hungarian ceramic art.
Most of her works are figurative, while many of the content messages are expressed through form and colour.
Her female figures are attractive, appealing, and unmistakeably Hungarian.
"I have found most clearly in young peasant girls and old peasant women the feelings with which I can identify most closely and which motivate my work", she recalled in an interview in 1966.
Her legendary creations are tales transferred into clay, and she sought to capture the fairytale element from reality.
Each of her moulded works represents a different form of emotional expression and a different life.
