National orb
The orb is the symbol of the coronation city of Székesfehérvár.
This is where most Hungarian kings were buried, starting with St. István (Stephen), and later including Kálmán Könyves, Róbert Károly, Lajos Nagy, King Matthias and János Szapolyai.
It is also the place where King István and Prince Imre were canonized, and where Europe's second constitution, the “Golden Bull”, was proclaimed.
The stone fruit, known as the national orb, is located in the town hall square, just in front of the Bishop's Palace.
This ornamental red marble fountain, representing one of the coronation symbols for Hungarian kings, was made by Béla Ohmann.
It is held in place by three stone lions, and has three dates defining the city's history - 1001, 1688 and 1938 - at its base.
The Latin inscription around the orb, LIBERTATES CIVITATIS ALBENSIS A S. REGE STEPHANO CONCESSAE, means "St. István gave Fehérvár its right to freedom".
