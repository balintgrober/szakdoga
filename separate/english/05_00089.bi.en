EXHIBITION
Shaman sculptures and stone jaguars
The exhibition in the Museum of Ethnography is presenting a newly acquired collection, which gives an insight into the ancient culture of Ecuador. Religious clay artefacts from this time actually precede the Inca conquest. The oldest piece is 4,600 years old, but even the youngest is more than 500 years old.
The nearly 300 pieces represent almost all of the pre-Inca archaeological cultures from the Columbian border up to Ecuador.
MOVIE
SIN CITY
SIN CITY, the powerful movie of Frank Miller (author of the original comic strip), Robert Rodriquez and guest director, Quentin Tarantino, promises to be one of the most exciting, unique and successful films of this year.
The film creators did not change anything regarding the silhouette-like style and dotted rhythm of the original cartoon. SIN CITY, therefore, is characterised by light, shadows, dense dialogues and masterful digital technique.
Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood and Clive Owen appear in the main roles.
OPERA
Handel: Semele
Fesztivál Theatre is presenting Semele, one of Handel's most mysterious pieces. It will be performed in English and directed by Péter Halász.
Although it is true that this production was played in an oratory style on its first night in 1744 based on Handel's request; its libretto makes it undeniably an opera.
This unique presentation is conducted by Christian Curnyn, with the participation of the Óbuda Chamber Choir and the Savaria Baroque Orchestra.
