He died just a few months ago at the age of ninety, and was an outstanding figure in contemporary Hungarian fine arts.
In 1945, Gyarmathy joined the Hungarian Group of Abstract Artists and became a member of the European School.
In 1947, his works were exhibited alongside those of Picasso and Braque in Paris, although after 1948 he did not participate in any public exhibitions for another fifteen years.
He was consistently true to his own non-figurative style, which cannot be compared to that of any other artist. Choosing not to conform to the Socialist-Realist trend of the 1950s, he instead went to work in the iron foundry in Diósgyõr and painted secretly on weekends in his flat in Pest.
Gyarmathy was only able to travel abroad after 1971, and eventually, after winning several international prizes, was also recognised in Hungary with the Outstanding Artist Award and the coveted Kossuth Prize.
Gyarmathy's paintings are "woven in light" and set in infinity, which the artist referred to as the cognitive space. The main organisational principle in his work is geometry.
The longer one gazes at the work "The rhythm of the city today", the more points of light one discovers in it.
One can see them as shining skyscrapers or as the flashing headlights from a stream of cars.
