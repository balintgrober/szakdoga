Feszty Rotunda
The story of Ópusztaszer's most important sight began in Paris back in the 1890's.
Around this time, a work by the painting duo of Detaille and Neuville - a rotunda depicting a Napoleonic battle - was a great success in the French capital.
This left a great impression on Árpád Feszty, who was visiting the city by floating along the Seine. On his return home, he resolved to tell a similar story of the Biblical flood through his own painting.
His father-in-law, the writer, Mór Jókai (who was also knew how to use a paintbrush), later suggested that it would be better to choose a Hungarian theme in light of the approaching millennium celebration for the Hungarian Conquest.
This is how the Conquest was chosen as the subject of the rotunda and how it received the title "Arrival of the Hungarians".
Many years later, this masterpiece was on the verge of destruction and it took four years to renovate and restore it.
Since 1995, it once again became possible to visit the famous work again in its renovated form.
In addition to the painting that covers 1,800 square meters, this national memorial, situated some 25km from Szeged, conjures up the past by virtue of its history exhibitions, reconstructed buildings, and furnishings, along with its objects recalling bygone eras, waxworks and live presentations.
