HISTORY
THE AGE OF THE ANGEVINE DYNASTY
Fights for the throne and autocracy
The Árpád dynasty became extinct with Andrew III's death on the male line. The female line continued and first the Angevines from Naples laid their claim for the Hungarian crown.
They did not even accept Andrew III's right to inherit the throne.
In August 1300 the twelve-year old Caroberto landed in Spalato, Dalmatia. He was Stephen V's grand-grandson through the relation to his father's grandmother, Maria.
In the country only a very few people supported him: the Subics-s, Ugrin from the Csák clan, and the Archbishop of Esztergom, Gregory Bicskei, who was loyal to the Pope.
His foreign supporters were more influential: the feudal lord of the kingdom of Naples, the Pope gave him diplomatic help, whereas his cousins on his mother's side, the Habsburg princes gave him military help as well.
When the news about Andrew III's death spread, the archbishop had Caroberto taken to Esztergom in the spring of 1301, and crowed him with a temporary crown.
The king, who used the name Charles [Károly] from that time on, counted the years of his reign from this very year.
After this coup-like coronation he retired to his southern supporters.
The majority of the dignitaries in the country chose another king from the Pñemysl-dynasty: Wenceslas, the Czech king, Wenceslas II's son, who was one year younger than Charles. He was Béla IV's grand-grand-grandson on his grand-grandmother, Anna's side. After the coronation he ruled under the name Ladislaus.
Pope Bonifac VIII minister to Hungary made part of Wenceslas's followers support Charles instead, who sieged Buda in 1302 unsuccessfully.
The people of Buda, who were the followers of Wenceslas - they were under church interdiction - made their priest excommunicate the Pope.
In the debate between the two kings, Pope Bonifac VIII, as a church judge, adjudicated the kingdom to Charles, and banned Wenceslas from bearing the title "Hungarian king".
He ordered that Wenceslas II's son be taken home to the Czech state together with the crown jewels.
Charles I's Hungarian and Cumanian troops - allied with Austrian and German troops - started a military campaign against him, without any success.
Wenceslas, who became a Czech king after his father's death, gave up the title "Hungarian king" in 1305, and ceded it - together with the crown - to the Bavarian ruler, Otto.
Prince Otto from the Wittelsbach dynasty - on his mother, Elisabeth's side he was Béla IV's grandson - was 44 years old in 1305, in contrast to the teenager Charles and Wenceslas.
Only the leaders of provinces and the Transylvanian Saxons supported him; the bishops acknowledged Charles.
As the bishop of Veszprém and Csanád crowned him with the Holy Crown brought from the Czech state, the opposing sides signed a one-year long armistice.
His reign ended in the summer of 1307, when voivode Ladislaus Kán captured him in Transylvania and took the Holy Crown away from him.
After a short time in prison he returned to Lower-Bavaria through Russia, where he bore the title "Hungarian king" till his death.
The supporters of Charles took over Buda with the help of a trick, so the middle of the country fell into the hands of the king from the Angevine dynasty.
In October 1307, at the gathering held in the field of Rákos, greater part of the leaders of provinces, the prelates and common noblemen declared Charles as Hungarian king.
Cardinal Gentilis, the Pope's minister came to Hungary in 1308.
To make Charles's reign acknowledged, first he sought for agreement, and when he did not succeed, he resorted to excommunication.
Since the legal crown for the coronation, the Holy Crown, was in Ladislaus Kán's possession, Charles was crowned king once again in 1309 with a crown consecrated by the cardinal. When the Holy Crown was regained, Charles was crowned for the third time - and finally - in 1310.
The cardinals activity was quite unsuccessful; Charles's reign extended only over the middle part of the country. The honorary titles were born by the leaders of the provinces, and royal power depended on them.
The war broke out first because of the most powerful of them, Máté Csák, but the main region of war became the north-east of the country.
The leader of this region was Palatine Amádé Aba - who wanted to take over the town of Kassa as well - who was murdered in 1311 by the people of Kassa.
In the next year the debate of Amádé's sons, supported by Máté Csák, and the town dissolved into open war.
The battle fought at Rozgony, near Kassa, was won by the royal army.
The power of the leaders of provinces was based on their private possessions, but it was exceeded over by the honours they obtained - national offices and county bailiff offices - and the influence and income of these honours.
They took over the royal possessions on their territories, and juristic power was also in their hands. Noblemen in the neighbourhood served them as familiares.
They wore their honours even after the king had appointed someone else to that post.
The majority of them originated from an old dignitary clan, but power was exercised by their close family.
It was quite general that within a clan the members supported opposing sides.
The majority of the leaders of provinces refused to take part in a military campaign against Máté Csák.
Charles declared them disloyal and deprived them of their honorary titles, and appointed his followers to their positions.
In 1315 he transferred his residence from Buda to the safer Temesvár. He directed the long war against the leaders of provinces from here.
He took revenge on them one by one, as the rebels rarely united.
His method was to take over the fortresses of the enemy first, then make his followers surrender and then he took away their possessions and appointed another person to the position of the rebel.
Open battles were hardly ever seen.
The most important year was 1317, when royal armies fought at different places at the same time.
The rebellious forces were the strongest in Transylvania, but battles were ended in 1321 there, too.
In the very same year Máté Csák died, against whom the king could not be really successful. But this year he could conquer his province in a few months.
He could also manage to maintain order temporarily in Slavonia and Dalmatia, and deprive the Subicses of their power in Croatia.
In 1323 the country reunited.
The king moved back to the middle of the country and set up his court at Visegrád.
Charles' consolidation
The new system of government was strictly centralised. All the matters of the country were settled in the royal court.
The court consisted of barons and noblemen who did not bear any honorary titles then, but they were involved in political decisions.
By the end of Charles' reign cases of actions for possession were arranged only at central courts, at the High Court of Justice, at the so-called 'eighth law-courts' or at general meetings held for several counties.
Charles convoked the diets only in the first period of his reign, after that he made important political decisions in the royal council, that is with the help of the prelates and barons.
He reformed the chancellery and finance in small steps. The office 'royal treasurer' appeared first in Hungary then.
In contrast to western countries the Hungarian Kingdom could be characterised by the dominance of royal power, so in his reforms, Charles could refer to his predecessors.
The Angevines considered themselves the descendants of the Árpáds and this was expressed in the use of their coat-of-arms.
The bigger part of the territory of the country was in the king's possession, his followers could receive those as gifts (honour) for their services.
The dominance of royal estates was typical throughout the Angevine age. The majority of mines and towns also belonged to the king or queen.
Charles and Louis the Great were quite mean, they did not give inheritable land gifts very often.
The bearers of offices - except for the Drugets from Naples - were families of Hungarian origin, the majority of them descended from the members of old clans.
Charles's reforms - such as the power of life and death and the system of investing daughters with the rights of sons, then during Louis the Great the introduction of the new gift -were in favour of the loyal court nobility.
Charles asserted his absolute power even against his first followers, the bishops. He appointed them, sometimes even in their predecessors' life.
Charles took back the ban district of Macsó from the Serbian ruler during the war to unite the country. The ban directing that district had power over other Hungarian counties.
Further efforts to expand the territory of the country failed owing to the strengthening Serbian power.
Bosnia, as before, existed as an independent country, though it depended on Hungary.
In Croatia people did not manage to restore royal power, even after dethroning the Subiches.
Venice had strengthened its power over the Dalmatian cities, the power of Hungarian kings over Zára, Sebenico, Trau, Spalato and Nona became nominal.
Hungarian kings - as kings of Cumania - laid their claims for reign over Wallachia [Havasalföld].
By this time the population there was almost completely Rumanian, and they lived in an independent principality formed by leader Basarab - who was of Cumanian origin - with Bulgarian support.
In the autumn of 1330 Charles personally led a campaign to surrender the country.
The returning Hungarian army might have been captured in the "Redtower pass", the majority of soldiers died there, even the king himself just managed to escape.
Charles did not launch any more attacks against Wallachia, and this battle contributed to the consolidation of the independent principality.
Foreign policy became more active after these domestic conflicts and it also changed direction.
At the beginning of the 14th century good relationship with the Habsbugs ended due to the fights to take back Pozsony and Muraköz [region of the river Mura] - which fell into Austrian hands. Hungarian troops attacked Austria several times, but the Austrian princes supported the Kõszeg clan, who last rebelled in the 1330s.
Polish-Hungarian relationships were the best.
In 1320 Charles married the Polish king's (Ulaszló Lokietek) daughter, Elisabeth. He gave military help to his father-in-law many times against the German order of Knighthood, Lithuania and the Czech state.
As a result of the new foreign policy relationship with the Czechs slowly improved, where the last Pñemysls, then the Luxemburg dynasty laid their claims for the Polish throne.
According to Angevine order of succession Charles should have received the right for the throne of Naples. However, because of his young age and his affairs in Hungary, his uncle, Robert the Wise, became king of Sicily - actually king of Naples.
Since Robert's only son died in his father's life and left two daughters, Charles renewed his claims for the throne for his son.
Neither the Papal court nor Naples supported the idea of unifying Hungarian-Neapolitan powers.
In 1333 Charles brought his second son, the six-year old Andrew, to Naples personally. He was engaged to Johanna, Robert's eldest granddaughter.
Although Charles did not manage to make his son king, he believed that after Robert's death Andrew will ascend the throne, as there was no tradition of female rulers.
In 1335 there was a successful mediation between John, the Czech king, and Casimir, the Polish king, which was confirmed at the royal meeting held at Visegrád in November.
John gave up his claim for the Polish throne.
As judges in the debate between Poland and the German order of Knighthood, the Hungarian and Czech kings adjudicated Kujavia and other regions to the Poles, and Pomerania to the Germans.
But in the case of Silesia the Czechs and the Poles did not reach an agreement.
Before this a Czech-Hungarian economic agreement was signed at Trencsén, which tried to assert that the German-Hungarian trade route should lead through the Czech state, ignoring the staple right of Vienna.
In 1339 Kazmer made a will: in the event that he did not have a male descendant, one of Charles's sons be Polish king.
Before these events, in the spring of 1330 one of the king's men in his court, the landowner in Nógrád county, Felician Záh, made a murderous attempt against the royal family in the Visegrád castle, as supposedly the Queen's younger brother seduced his daughter, Clara with the Queen's approval.
Charles suffered smaller injuries, but Queen Elisabeth lost her four fingers.
Záh was immediately killed, and members of his clan were executed.
This procedure, which reminds us of Neapolitan blood feud, was against the Hungarian law, so the events contributed to the general opinion which regarded the reign of the first Angevine ruler less effective than that of Louis the Great.
The age of Louis the Great
After his death, Charles was followed on the throne by his 16-year old son, Louis the Great.
Besides him - almost as a co-ruler - his mother, Elisabeth, intervened in everything. When he was away he asked her to perform the governor's duties.
Louis liked warfare - he came close to losing his life in several battles -, tournaments and hunts.
Similarly to his mother he was deeply religious.
He was a great admirer of St Ladislaus, he minted his portrait to his golden forints instead of the coins with St John's portrait minted by Charles after the Florentine model.
Robert the Wise, who died in 1343, appointed his daughter, Johanna, as his heir in his testament.
When the Pope approved of crowning Andrew as Sicilian king after a long hesitation, the followers of Johanna killed the prince with the Queen's knowledge.
Although the murderers were executed, Louis's attempt to ask the Pope to dethrone Johanna, was unsuccessful, as the Pope did not want the Angevines' Hungarian and Neapolitan lines to unite.
The Hungarian king - referring back to his father'sone-time claim for the throne - considered himself the legal heir of the Neapolitan throne. According to the new order of succession, however, after Johanna's withdrawal another Angevine, Charles - prince of Durazzo - would have had the right for the throne.
In 1347 Louis lead a campaign personally against Naples.
His Hungarian and German mercenaries met only slight resistance. Queen Johanna escaped to her ancient French estates to recruit people for her troops.
Louis captured the princes, who came to admire him, and he had his rival, Charles executed. At the beginning of 1348 he marched into Naples and took up the title "king of Sicily and Jerusalem".
Because of the discontent after the execution and the plague he returned home after some months.
The troops left behind could not keep the conquested regions, Johanna - on her new husband's side - soon took back her country with the exception of some fortresses.
In 1349 the plague reached Hungary, and the Queen - Louis's first wife - died in pestilence, too.
In 1350 the royal Hungarian army started its second campaign against Naples.
They took over the capital, but they did not manage to confirm Hungarian rule this time either.
Louis the Great gave up his claims for the throne of Sicily and Jerusalem and signed a ceasefire with Johanna.
The majority of the royal army returned to Hungary, but Hungarian knights, as members of the "great Hungarian army", had still been fighting in Italy for years. Miklós Toldi was among them.
Louis the Great reinforced the centralised government set up by his father.
He was forced to make concessions only once, after the unsuccessful Neapolitan wars and the plague.
In November 1351 - for the first time during his reign - he convoked the diet in Buda.
He reinforced the Golden Bull, which was considered the basic law of noble rights in that form from the 15th century on.
At a place, however, he changed Andrew II's order: he repealed the right of noblemen dying without heirs to make a free will and extended the aviticity to them, that is, property without a legal heir be turned to the king.
The 1351 law declared the idea of "one and the same freedom" of noblemen living within the borders of the country. This meant exemption from all kinds of taxation and services - so with this law he exempted the noblemen of Slavonia, Pozsega and Valkó from paying taxes.
He limited the declaration of church interdictions against noblemen who carried on a lawsuit against churches.
He regulated the collection of tax called "the profit of the chamber", ordered to repeal the collection of unlawful customs duties, decided on various lawsuit matters.
He ordered the collection of the ninth, and he promised to perform this on the king's and the queen's estates, too.
Louis the Great did not want to share his power with the diet permanently. He convoked the noblemen once again in 1352, but never more.
The influence of the noblemen expanded only to their county.
Counties did not have a either a permanent armed force or other authority than the sedria. We cannot even talk about local governments in the counties.
To judge local criminals and administration of justice in case of noblemen who could not visit the royal High Court of Justice was the duty of other office bearers - according to the order of the palatine and the king -, who held general meetings for several counties from time to time.
In the 70s there were several changes in the government, aiming at an even more powerful centralisation of power.
The chancellery was divided into two parts, the secret chancellery was established with the lead of the secret chancellor.
The head of the former chancellery got the title "supreme chancellor".
The third department of the High Court of Justice was set up, too: besides the law court of the palatine and the court of royal presence headed by the supreme judge, the court of special royal presence was formed, headed by the supreme chancellor.
The royal treasurer was not a financial office bearer any more, he became the judge of appeal cases of royal towns.
His financial duties were taken over by the independent treasure keeper from that time on.
Louis the Great restored royal power in Croatia at the beginning of his reign.
He made Dalmatian towns surrender during his Venetian campaign started in 1356 in alliance with Padua.
In the 1358 peace of Zára the doges gave up their titles "Prince of Croatia and Dalmatia", which they had been bearing for centuries.
Hungary had supremacy from Ragusa - conquered at that time - to as far as Quarnero.
This was reinforced by the 1381 peace of Turin, after another war.
In Bosnia he entered a war because of Bogumilian heresy, after his loyal father-in-law's death.
After the death of István Dusán, who was crowned tsar in 1346, Serbia fell to pieces.
The northern part of the country fell into the hands of the Hungarians, South Serbia fell under Osmanian-Turkish rule after the battle near the river Marica (1371).
In Wallachia the successor of Basarab surrendered to the Hungarian king - in return he received Syrmia. The Rumanian principality, however, remained practically independent.
In the 70s border fortresses were built against the unreliable neighbours: Törcsvár and Tolmács; Orsova was renovated.
In 1375 the Hungarian troops fought against the Osmans - who were the allies of the Rumanians - for the first time. During Louis the Great's life there was no Turkish attack on Hungary.
The northern part of Bulgaria - which was divided into two regions at that time -, the territory of the tsar of Vidin, fell under the rule of Hungarian bans for a short time, then it became a feudal tenure.
Beyond the eastern border the Hungarian army defeated the attacking Tartars.
After the retreat of the Golden Horde, Bogdán, voivode of Máramaros, founded the second Rumanian principality around 1359. It was called Moldva.
Louis the Great led several military campaigns here, but Moldavia became Hungary's feudal tenure only for a very short time, later it fell under Polish influence.
Polish king, Casimir the Great, died in 1370.
According to the agreement of 1339 Louis the Great - who helped the Polish in several campaigns against Lithuania earlier - followed him on the throne.
The Polish-Hungarian personal union was quite unsuccessful.
The king left the governing of the country to his mother, but there was a riot in Krakow against Elisabeth's violent rule, and the Queen was forced to return home.
Her successor, Ladislaus, Prince of Oppeln, was also unsuccessful as a ruler.
Louis the Great governed Halics - taken over from the Lithuanians - from Hungary, he appointed Hungarians to the lead of local fortresses.
The "Great Privilege" - which played an important role in Polish social development - was issued in 1374 in Kassa. With this document the Polish ruler made his people recognise the right of his daughters for the throne.
Louis the Great wanted his elder daughter, Maria, and her fiancée, Sigismund, to ascend the throne after his death.
Johanna - who supported the Pope of Avignon after the division of the western church - was dethroned by the Pope of Rome in 1380. He offered the throne for Little Charles, who was educated at the Hungarian royal court.
Little Charles, who was supported by Hungarian troops, easily defeated Naples in 1381, and had Johanna murdered in 1382.
At the end of his reign Louis the Great became infected with leprosy, he retreated from public life and lived a religious life.
His followers accepted succession on the female line, but the legal theory of secular people was against the rule of queens. According to it the suitability of kings depended on their military skills.
After the King's death, his 11-year old daughter, Maria, was crowned at Székesfehérvár.
The country was governed by her mother, Elisabeth, and palatine Nicholas Garai instead of her.
The Polish would have accepted Maria and Sigismund, on the condition that the ruler should live in Poland.
The reign of queens
After a long hesitation the Queen-mother sent her younger daughter, Hedvig, to Poland. She was crowned in 1384, so the possibility of renewing the personal union came to an end.
Two years later Hedvig was married to the Lithuanian Chief Prince, Jagello, who accepted Christianity not long before.
In Hungary there was great dissatisfaction with Elisabeth, who called herself queen.
The Queen-mother and her followers, with the lead of Palatine Nicholas Garai, wanted Maria to marry Louis, Prince of Orleans. The majority of the barons insisted on Sigismund, the Horváti brothers - who had a great influence on common noblemen - wanted a male king and offered Little Charles the Hungarian throne.
Little Charles landed in Dalmatia in September, 1385.
Maria and Elisabeth, who were afraid of losing their leading position, now accepted Sigismund, and held the wedding, but the husband escaped when he heard the news about the arrival of the usurper.
A diet was convoked in Buda, which elected Little Charles king and made Maria give up her position.
The reign of the new king lasted for 39 days. Elisabeth's followers attacked him in Buda castle in 1386, he was taken to Visegrád with serious injuries, where he was probably poisoned.
A civil war broke out in the country.
Slavonia, Croatia and Bosnia fell into the hands of the rebels.
In 1386 the queens, who went to the south to soothe the problems, were attacked by the Horvátis as they reached the market town Gara. Garai and his company were killed, the women were captured, and Elisabeth was strangled in prison in the following year.
Horváti, insisting on legal succession, wanted Little Charles's infant son, Ladislaus of Naples, to be king.
The barons took the positions to govern the country, they even had a new signet made with the writing "signet of the people of the country" on it.
There was no representation of the estates, no diets were convoked, Louis's one-time barons considered themselves representatives of the people of the country.
THE AGE OF SIGISMUND
The league and the king
The noblemen, who joined the league, accepted Sigismund to their company. Sigismund made a promise in his letter of alliance that he would keep the old traditions of the country, govern the country in concert with the interests of the league, and would not give offices and land gifts to foreigners.
He was crowned in 1387. His reign was based on election and not on succession.
After her wife's escape, he became a formal co-ruler, however, actually it was him who governed the country.
He managed to suppress the southern rebels only after a long battle.
In 1395 Queen Maria died, so the clan of saint kings died out on both lines.
Sigismund's reign till 1403 was overshadowed by the influence of the league - though it was gradually decreasing.
The leaders of the league were János Kanizsai, Archbishop of Esztergom, the supreme chancellor and the palatine of the first years, Stephen Lackfi. The other members also originated from Louis the Great's one-time baron families.
They received enormous land gifts between 1387-1392 as a result of which royal land possessions, which dominated over private land possessions since the beginning of the age of the Árpád dynasty, were now in minority against private land possessions, especially secular estates.
Half of the royal castles with the surrounding lands, and also cities or smaller estates were given away during a couple of years.
After the 1389 battle of Rigómezõ the neighbouring states of the Balkans gradually surrendered to the Osmans.
The Turks often broke into the region of river Temes and Syrmia.
At first Sigismund tried to attack them.
In 1396, as a result of long diplomatic preparatory works, he declared his campaign against the Turks a crusade and left for the Balkans with a cavalry composed of European people of different nationalities.
The traditional courtly warfare seemed to be unsuitable against the Turks.
The Turkish army, led by sultan Bajezid, destroyed the Christian troops on 28 September at Nicapole, Bulgaria.
Since 1396 Hungary made arrangements for defence. The means of this policy were the neighbouring states of the Balkans till the 1420s, which were made Hungary's vassals by Sigismund. Turkish attacks were impeded on the territory of these countries.
He appointed Mircea cel Bútrin to the lead of Wallachia in 1395, who also received estates and castles in South Transylvania.
In Serbia Stephen Lazarevics, who submitted to the Turks, accepted Sigismund as his king in 1403.
The surrender of Bosnia was a rather more difficult task, as there was no firm central power.
The real ruler of the country, Hervoja, surrendered to him only after several campaigns, in 1409.
After the battle of Nicapole, Stephen Lackfi, the one-time palatine, who was dissatisfied with Sigismund, contacted Ladislaus of Naples, who saw a favourable occasion to obtain the Hungarian crown.
The plot was discovered, the followers of the king murdered Lackfi in 1397, and the large estate of his family was taken away.
This year a diet was convoked at Temesvár.
The 1351 laws and the Golden Bull were reinforced with a few changes, but the additional clause about opposition was omitted.
Despite their old privilege, noblemen were obliged to join the army - even beyond the borders - during the Turkish threat.
Those who resisted had to pay a fine.
There were orders about setting up the army of servant-soldiers: landowners had to provide an archer after every 20 of their villeins.
To cover the costs of defence the church also had to pay tax and their tenth was distrained as well.
The right of villeins for free moving was reinforced: if they paid their land rents and debts, they could leave their lords freely.
The king promised to restrict investing daughters with the rights of sons, to take back his unfair gifts and replace foreign office bearers.
To help him repress the power of the league Sigismund had already found his new followers before the battle of Nicapole.
The barons arrested the king in 1401 with the aim of removing foreigners.
The council of the prelates and baron governed the country for a few months in the name of the Holy Crown. They issued their charters "with the signet of the Holy Crown of Hungary". They could not, however, agree on the question of succession.
The king was saved by Nicholas Garai and Hermann Cillei's action.
Sigismund became engaged to Cillei's daughter, Borbala, and he promised that he would not punish the participants of the plot.
In 1402 Sigismund appointed Albert IV, Austrian prince, to the Hungarian throne in case he would die without a legal heir. He also appointed Garai to the post of palatine.
The members of the league who felt to be cheated organised an open riot in 1403. The centers of their operations were in Transylvania, the region beyond the river Tisza and in the south.
Common noblemen joined them in great numbers, too.
Ladislaus of Naples, who arrived in Dalmatia, was crowned with a temporary crown in Zára by Kanizsai.
But Sigismund's supporters had military advantage, so the majority of the rebels surrendered without any fight, and the resistance of the others was soon broken down.
Hungarian king as an emperor
After the riot Sigismund's power remained firm in Hungary.
His main supporters were Nicholas Garai, who was the palatine of the country till the end of his life, and Hermann Cilei.
The king was away from the country several times, on such occasions his deputies, the Vicars governed the state instead of him but with his knowledge.
In 1408 he founded the Dragon Society with his wife, Borbala, and 22 of his followers.
Its aim was to fight against the pagans, that is the Turks, but in reality it was the union of the new elite and the ruling family.
In the question of succession Sigismund insisted on the Habsburgs even after Albert IV's death.
His daughter, Elisabeth, married Albert V, Austrian prince.
His relationship with the Jagellos was quite stiff: at the beginning of his reign he was forced to gave up Halics for their benefit and accept that Moldavia was Poland's vassal state.
In 1409 Ladislaus of Naples sold Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 golden Forints.
By 1420 the republic occupied the whole province, so Sigismund started all their military campaigns in vein.
All of them ended with an armistice, the Dalmatian towns got out of Hungarian supremacy forever.
In 1412 he put part of the Szepesség in pawn to Ulaslo II, Polish king.
By the 1420s the system of the neighbouring states used for Hungary's defence collapsed.
Because of the unreliability of the Bosnian dignitaries some of their fortresses were occupied by Hungarian guards, but there was no chance to make the whole country surrender.
After Mircea's death the chief princes of Wallachia vacillated between Hungarian and Turkish vassalage.
The Turks attacked Slavonia from Bosnia and Transylvania from Wallachia.
Stephen Lazarevics handed over Belgrad to Sigismund in 1427, but Galambóc fell into the hands of the Turks.
In the following year there was an unsuccessful campaign to take back the fortress.
Thus the country had common borders with the Osman Empire.
The new system of defence consisted of a network of fortresses built in the south at very high costs, which impeded the Turks for almost a century.
In the 30s the military system was reformed.
The army of the age consisted of three parts: royal troops, the banderies of dignitaries and troops of the counties.
The troops were foretold where to fight.
In 1435 a significant litigation law was accepted.
The courts of special royal presence were liquidated, the courts of personal royal presence substituted them.
This was the court of the supreme and secret chancellor, who made judgements in the king's name.
In the spring of 1437 there were peasants' riots in North Transylvania, and in Szatmár, Szabolcs and Ugocsa counties, because in 1436 the Transylvanian bishop laid his demands for the tithe of the previous three years in money which was introduced in the current year - as he did not collect tithe in the previous years because of the high inflation rates.
The rebels, who gathered on Bábolna hill, near the borough Alparét, defeated the army of the voivode.
The partied regulated villeins' right for making testaments, the land rent, the duties to perform gifts and robot, the supply of armies marching through the region, and the sheep fiftieth tax of the Rumanians.
The riot was suppressed at the beginning of the following year.
The doctrine of the Holy Crown
As a result of the change of dynasties and natural development in legislation a new idea of political law was in the making.
The concept of the crown - which referred to the king's rights - was extended in the 14th century: it meant the territory of the country, the power of the state independent of the king.
The special feature of the Hungarian doctrine of the crown was the fact that it referred to a real object: the Holy Crown attributed to St Stephen.
International agreements were signed in the name of this, and the crown slowly became independent of the king. It was considered the crown of the country, and not the actual king's crown.
This time a new principle was introduced, namely that a coronation was legal only if it was performed with the Holy Crown at Székesfehérvár, by the Archbishop of Esztergom, or in his absence, the Archbishop of Kalocsa.
LINGUISTICS
THE OLD HUNGARIAN PERIOD
The characteristic features of the Hungarian language of the time
From the point of view of the history of the Hungarian language the time of the reign of the Angevine kings and Sigismund is considered the middle period of the Old Hungarian age.
Phonetical and morphological changes - which started when the Hungarians began their independent life, and were wide-spread in the age of the Árpád dynasty - became completed and firm by this time.
The spread of intellectual culture was parallel to the spread of material culture.
Vocabulary was quite rich.
The number of schools increased and not only ecclesiastical, but also secular people could learn.
Literacy also spread.
More and more people visited foreign schools, such as the universities of Paris, Padua, Bologna, Vienna and Krakow.
Universities were founded in Hungary, too: at Pécs in 1367, at Óbuda in 1389.
The spread of culture helped the development of the language, which became suitable for the more accurate and sophisticated expression of thoughts.
There were thousands of charters, issued at royal chancelleries or charter-issuing offices.
The very few Hungarian phrases they include inform us about the vocabulary, phonetic and morphological relations of the age.
Starting from the end of the 14th century longer written works were also issued, which included a rich material about the condition and development of the language of the age.
These texts are partly ecclesiastic, partly secular works.
Ecclesiastic linguistic relics
The majority of ecclesiastic linguistic relics are codices.
The earliest Hungarian codex is the Jókai codex, which includes the legends of St Francis of Assissi.
This is the first hand-written book in Hungarian, a copy of a codex translated from Latin after 1372, made around 1448.
The original text was translated by Observant Franciscan monks for the Clarissan nuns or the Beginas of Óbuda, who did not speak Latin.
The original translation was lost, only a copy survived.
The copy was probably made in Óbuda (or Gyöngyös).
The text of the Jókai codex originates from several Latin translations.
The biggest part of it is from a 14th-century collection of legends, entitled "Actus Beati Francisci et sociorum eius" (The Life of St Francis and his friends).
This source describes St Francis similar to Christ.
It tells us about St Francis's 40-day fast, his prayers on mount Alverna, it describes how he obtained Christ's five wounds and how he founded the Franciscan order.
It also mentions pleasant episodes and miracles: how a wild wolf was converted in Gubbio at the request of St Francis and how the saint preached for his "sisters, the birds".
The parts describing St Francis's virtues (poverty, obedience and devoutedness) were taken from a collection of legends, called "Speculum perfectionis" (The Mirror of Perfectness).
Besides these sources the translators also used St Bonaventura's biography about St Francis.
The spelling of the Jókai codex does not use the secondary signs of punctuation, it follows the practice of chancellery spelling.
Its language is rather archaic; the copy shows an earlier state of the language.
For example, its spelling does not reflect the openness of the vowels in certain words, like , for example (in modern spelling) 'husszú' [long], 'társot' [company], 'lossan' [slowly], 'magamot' [myself], 'fiadot' [your son].
From among the changes in consonants it does not show the mt > nt assimilation (for example, 'himt', 'romt', 'cimterem'), nor the assimilation of postfixes -val/-vel: 'malasztval' [with grace], 'járásval' [with walk], 'sebességvel' [with speed]...etc.
It uses a lot of archaic words: 'álojt' [think], 'ösztövérít' [consume], 'késál' [fight], 'leuzát' [scandal]...etc.
Instead of the word temple it uses church; regarding the word puszta it does not know it as a noun plain, instead of this word it uses dreary.
There are a lot of words created by conscious word forming: derivated and compound words. For example: kedveletes = kedves [nice], jelenségbeli [private, individual], községbeli [common], átkozottak [damned], hogyhana = mintha [as if]...etc.
The structure of sentences in the codex are strongly influenced by Latin.
The Latin text is often clumsily translated word by word, and the Hungarian version follows not only the meaning, but also all the comparing means, word order, passive voice and agreement of the Latin.
The first Hungarian Bible translations the Hussite Bible.
This is the only Hungarian product of Hussitism.
The Bible (or at least the greatest part of it) was translated by two secular priests from Syrmia: Thomas Pécsi, altar priest from Kamonc (today: Kamenica) and Master Bálint Újlaki, parish priest from Belcsény (today: Beocin).
Both of them studied at the university of Prague between 1399-1411, and having learnt about the teachings of János Husz, they became Hussites themselves.
They started the Bible translation around 1416, and finished it before 1441.
Together with Hussite teachings they adopted Hussite spelling and used it in their translation.
The translation did not follow the spirit of Catholic teachings.
For example, the expression spiritus sanctus 'The Holy Spirit' was translated as the holy breath, which was considered heretic.
As the Franciscan inquisitors pursued them, in 1439 priest Thomas and his followers escaped to Moldavia. The pursuers caught them up and took away the Bible translation.
Fortunately they did not destroy the confiscated translation, but they used it themselves.
The original translation was finally destroyed during the 15th century, its text survived in manuscripts.
The codices which include the text of the Hussite Bible are the following:
The earliest copied codex of the Bible translation is the Vienna codex. It was probably copied from the original one around 1450.
It includes some smaller books from the Old Testament: Books of Ruth, Judith, Esther, the Maccabai, Baruk, Daniel and twelve smaller prophets.
The sequence of the books does not follow the order of the Vulgate.
The codex was copied by three different persons.
The greatest part of it originates from the second person.
The copiers made a lot of spelling mistakes, but they all follow the signs of Hussite spelling.
The signs for open and closed 'e' sounds are the most consistent in this codex.
The second manuscript in chronological order is the Munich codex.
It includes the four gospels of the New Testament.
There is a 12-page Hungarian calendar - with the names of public holidays, the saints and a calendar wheel - on a parchment bound in front of the gospels.
With the help of the wheel one could compile the calendar for every year.
The calendar wheel is valid for the years between 1416 and 1435; this shows that the Bible translation must have been started after 1416.
The Munich codex was copied by three different persons.
The copy is not as consistent in spelling (with special regard to the signs for the 'e' sound) as the Vienna codex.
The copier of the biggest part wrote his name, the place and date of copying under the finishing sentence of John's gospel.
According to this the copier was Emeric Henzsel's son, George Németi; his work was finished in the Moldavian town Tatros (today: Trotus, Rumania) in 1466.
His name, Németi refers to the fact that he might have come from a Saxon family.
The Apor codex consisted of several manuscripts of different origin and content.
It might have been a result of a number of copies. The several misspellings and misuses of words in it refer to this fact.
Its copiers were probably Catholic monks.
Only the part containing psalms from the Old Testament - made around 1490 - came from the Hussite Bible.
This part was made by two persons.
The other parts were copied by four different persons.
These are already from the 16th century, and contain translations made in the spirit of Catholicism.
The so-called "three significant services" might have been made around 1500, which describes the order of services of the three Mary celebrations.
In the part which was made around 1510 there are medieval hymns and prayers from the Old Testament.
The part which describes Jesus's torture may have been copied around 1515.
The three codices of the Hussite Bible are closely connected by their contents, language and mode of expression.
The original condition of the language of the Bible translation was probably preserved by the Vienna codex, the other two codices contain the dialects of the copiers.
The translators had to cope with many problems so that they could express the richness of the Bible's culture in the Hungarian language.
Biblical, ecclesiastical linguistic elements, Hungarian extracts known from masses, which were used in Hungarian Christianity, might have helped their work.
They may have known German and Czech Bible translations as well, and these could influence their usage of words.
They created more than two hundred new words by derivation, compound words and the renewal of old words.
They used several special words, which became archaic since then. For example, álanalkodat = csel [trick], címerlet = cím [title], ragadozat = préda [prey], villamodat = hajnal [dawn], levált = farizeus [Pharisee], hirvadat = halványság [plainness], monnó = mindkettõ [both], holval = reggel [morning]...etc.
Their language is full of emphatic adverbials and pronouns. For example, míglen, mikoron [when], netalántál [probably], önnön bennük [in themselves], minenmagunk [ourselves]...etc.
The consistent use of linking words is also typical of the language. For example, monnal = mint [like], és úgy = tehát [therefore], mint, miként, miképpen [as]...etc.
Certain forms of verbs, which later became archaic, were quite frequently used, for example, future tense with -nd (látand, üldözend, meghaland) [will see, will chase, will die].
The structure of their sentences, the agreement of the modes and tenses of verbs were frequently influenced by the Latin language.
In spite of the linguistic inaccuracy and Latinisms we can say that the translators of the Hussite Bible had created the literary language of the 15th century.
From among ecclesiastical linguistic relics also deserves mentioning a short one, called "Lines and Glosses from Marosvásárhely".
It was discovered in the Koncz codex of Marosvásárhely.
It was made by an unknown translator around 1410.
It contains a translation of a part from the Book of Kings, one of the books of the Old Testament.
There are numerous mistakes and mistranslations in its text.
Its language can be characterised by vowels referring to pronunciation without rounding. For example, melléled = mellõled [next to you], midén = midõn [as], kelket = kölyköt [young of an animal], tivis = tövis [thorn]...etc.
The translator inserted four short glosses (altogether 11 words) next to the Biblical text.
The short relic from 1433, called the Laska lines, is also of ecclesiastical type.
This is a 5-line Hungarian text in a Latin codex.
Its author is a Benedictine monk, Demeter Laskói.
The content of the relic is a prayer to Christ written in verse, a poetic translation of a Latin prayer also written in verse.
Its language can be characterised by the use of closed vowels (i, ü).
Its spelling resembles to chancellery spelling.
Secular linguistic relics
The secular linguistic relics of the age are almost all Latin-Hungarian word lists.
Actually these are dictionaries of the time.
They were made to make learning Latin easier, and they were used in school education and in chancelleries.
The Latin words are grouped around concepts. The Hungarian meanings are written above the Latin words.
These word lists are very important from the point of view of medieval Hungarian vocabulary, word formation and the ethymology of words.
The earliest Hungarian dictionaries developed from these word lists, too.
The oldest Latin-Hungarian word list is the Königsberg word list. It may have been compiled around 1380.
It was probably used in a royal chancellery.
It contains 159 Latin words, but only 100 words were explained in Hungarian.
It is the work of two copiers, whose mother tongue might have been German.
The word list contains words referring to family relations, senses, good and bad characteristic features, emotions, illnesses and the names of items of clothing, tools and weapons.
The Beszterce, Schlägl and Sopron word list can be traced back to a single original one.
All the lists were made with the mediation of several lost copies.
The original list may have been prepared between 1380-90.
The sample could have been the Latin material of a Latin-German list of words, made in the Bavaria-Austria region.
The Beszterce word list was copied by a guest teacher, George from "Tótország" [Slovakia] around 1395.
The word list may have been a school book used in a town school.
It contains 1316 Hungarian words, grouped around 21 main concepts.
It also lists words, which became archaic by today. For example, hort [greyhound], pikonhog [a type of helmet], pakocsa [teasing], kotorgárt [shield], higy [earring], egyveng [brother or sister]...etc.
The majority of its words shows closed vowels; for example, iszop = iszap [mud], sum = som [dogberry], lopus = lapos [flat]...etc.
It is very interesting from the point of view of the history of culture: it does not know the names of fire weapons, although it gives a detailed description about the weapons of the Sigismund age.
The Schlägl word list was compiled around 1405. Its copier is unknown.
It contains 2140 Hungarian words, grouped around 32 main concepts.
We can find words of spiritual culture in it. For example, elme, értelem, szándék, ok [mind, sense, will, reason]... etc.
Its words belonging to literary education are: for example, the names of musical instruments (kürt, síp, gajd, hegedû, lant...etc.) [horn, whistle, a type of wind instrument, violin, lute...etc] and the job names of entertainers (kürtös, igric, dobos) [horn-player, minstrel, drummer].
Archaic words also occur, for example, verõ = kalapács [hammer], kõláb = oszlop [column], állterem = álkapocs [jaw]..etc.
In some words there are very closed vowels, for example, harum = három [three], habus = habos [foamy], orrus = orros [nosy]...etc.
The Sopron word list was probably a fragment of a longer word list.
There are only 5 main concept groups with 217 words.
It was copied around 1435.
The copier was inaccurate and unskillful, he may have been a student.
The list is shorter than the Beszterce and Schlägl word lists, but it contains words which are not included in earlier bigger word lists.
The Jász word list - which was prepared after 1422 - can be found in a Jász-Latin word list.
It contains only 6 (maybe 8) Hungarian words; these are names of food and drinks, and items needed for cooking, for example, vaj, árpa, fú = vadkacsa [butter, barley, wild duck].
The relic called "The Hungarian language-master of student John of Rotenburg" is a collection of words similar to word lists.
Its words are the notes of a man whose mother tongue was German.
Between 1418 and 1422 the student wrote the most important Hungarian words and expressions to a page of a Latin school book. These were, for example, names of family relations, words referring to eating, washing, clothing and everyday life, even some obscene expressions.
The language-master contains some fragments of sentences, and short sentences, such as "Is this yours?", "You give me some wine!", "I'm talking to you."...etc.
We can find shorter or longer glosses among secular linguistic relics.
The gloss called the "Mondsee gloss", which contains three words "ravasz [róka] átkozta szél" ("cunning {fox} damn wind"), was written around 1390 in the codex of legends of the Upper-Austrian Mondsee abbey.
The Vienna glosses can be found in a school book from around 1423, which was taken from Esztergom to Vienna.
The glosses were written by four different persons.
One of them - as his name shows - Jakab Bélai, was a student, whose mother tongue was German, so may have learnt the Hungarian language together with Latin.
The biggest collection of glosses is the Schlägl glosses.
This contains 130 words, which may have been copied to a Latin codex around 1430. The Schlägl word list was attached to this codex.
The majority of the glosses are nouns: names of plants and animals.
THE SYSTEM OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE OLD HUNGARIAN PERIOD
Vocabulary
The linguistic relics of the age show the enrichment and significant development of both the vocabulary and grammar of the language.
The basis of vocabulary were the ancient words of the ancestors: words inherited from the Uralian, Finno-Ugric and Ugric periods.
Early Turkish and other loan words from the period preceeding the Conquest also survived.
Many new words were created with the help of derivation and compound words.
The words which originate from this period are the following: from among derivated words szól, remél, szerez, habozik, forgács, szerzet...etc [say, hope, obtain, hesitate, shavings, acquisition]; from among compound words szerszám, timsó, szûkszerû = szûk, társzekér...etc [tools, alum, tight, wagon].
Inner word formation is also very productive in this period, for example, rí, óhajt, köp, hurut = köhög, üvölt, ah, no, rendül, háborodik [cry, wish, spit, cough, roam, ah, come on, be shaked, become angry].
Concerning words of inner word formation not only the main parts of speech (verbs and nouns) show development, but also other ones.
The definite article, the formation of which started in the early old Hungarian period, is now more separated from demonstrative pronouns, and its role as article became firmer.
The numeral 'egy' [one = a] started to take up the role of the indefinite article in this period, too.
The emphatic forms of personal pronouns 'ön, ten, tennen, minnen = mi [self, yourself, ourselves] became more popular.
The circle of linking words, modifying words, adverbials and verbal prefixes also grew.
As a result of frequent communication with other peoples the number of loan words referring to culture, religion, different fields of everyday life, the world of plants and animals and economic life also increased.
Adoptions from Latin are, for example, cédrus, cinterem, legenda, fundál, július [cedar, legend, found, July].
Italian loan words are, for example, lándzsa, egres, mandula, dézsma, füge, korcsolya...etc [spear, gooseberry, almond, tithe, fig, skates].
The words paraj, lakat, tárgy, címer, kilincs [spinach, lock, object, shield, handle] were adopted from French.
Adoptions from the German language are: bognár, erkély, csûr, font, hóhér, kalmár, lant, példa [cooper, balcony, pound, executioner, merchant, lute, example].
Words of Slav origin are: gabona, jászol, ige, pecsét, kapca, galagonya, póráz, lencse, kár, parancsol...etc [cerials, manger, verb, seal, socks, hawthorn, lead, lentil, damage, to order].
There are some adoptions from the Rumen (for example, ficsúr [dandy]) and the Cuman (kalauz [conductor]) languages.
There are some changes concerning proper names.
Personal names had only one element in the early Old Hungarian period.
Partly they were based on earlier secular name giving (for example, Fekete, Szõke, Szár = kopasz...etc. [Black, Fair, Bold]), partly on ecclesiastical names received by baptising (for example, János, Iván, Benedek, Mihály [John, Ivan, Benedict, Michael]).
The tradition of using names of two elements started during the 14th century as the changes concerning possessions required the exact distinction of the names of the estate owners.
The distinctive element was attached to the personal name, first in a Latinish form - with the help of the word dictus [said, named] or filius [son].
Examples for names from the Hungarian Charter dictionary: Antonius dictus Kerekes 'Anton named Kerekes', Petrus dictus Fekete 'Peter (who was) said Fekete [Black]', Ladislaum filium Petew 'Petew's son, Ladislaus'...etc.
The element dictus was later omitted: Jakobus Oregh 'Old Jacob', Georgii Kun 'George Kún'...etc.
Now they refer to the father with the help of a Hungarian element, the word fia [son]. For example, Pálfiajános 'Paul's son, John'; Demeter fia István 'Demeter's son, Stephen'...etc.
Later the distinctive element of the name became the family name. For example, (in place names) Egrimihályháza [House of Mihály from Eger], Varjujánosháza [House of János Varjú]...etc.
People in lower layers of the society started to use family names only in the 16-17th centuries.
Concerning place names, the number of names created by place name suffixes (-d, -s, -I) decreased, while the number of compound names significantly grew.
It was very popular to name a place after the patron saint of the local church: Szentjános, Szentimre, Szentanna...etc.
Another widespread tradition was to put nationality names in front of place names: Magyarfalu, Németfalu, Oroszmezõ...etc [Hungarian village, German village, Russian field].
Grammar
The development of the grammatical system follows the line of the ancient and early Old Hungarian period.
The most important phonetic changes, which made the language more sonorous and similar to its modern form (like, for example, the openness of vowels, the simplification of diphthongs, and the assimilation of consonants), were finished or almost finished by this time.
Spelling, however, preserved the original phonetic condition for a long time.
Due to phonetic changes and tendencies towards different phonetic equalisations there were changes in the roots of the words as well.
Low-position vowels at the end of word roots (a, e), then later middle-position vowels (o, ö) separated from word roots and became part of suffixes.
The development of the complete system of modern types of word roots started; single and multi-form roots and the different versions of v-roots appeared (for example, bokor: bokrot; mezõ : mezeje; szõ : szövök; ló : lova; keserû : keserves [bush, field, weave, horse, bitter]).
New grammatical means of the morphological system appeared.
Concerning verbal formative syllables there were various compound affixes and formative groups besides the simple formative syllables which were used earlier. For example, -ng, -sít, -doz/-dez/-döz, -dokol/-dekel/-dököl, -aszt/-eszt, -asztal/-esztel, -aml/-eml, -lkodik/-lködik...etc.
The number participles formed with the affix -andó/-endõ, -ván/-vén is significantly big.
The new noun formative syllables are: -ós/-õs, -atos/-etes, -cska/-cske, -dad/-ded, -lat/-let, -ságos/-séges, -ságú/-ségû, -zat/-zet; the new form the word nõ [woman] was -né...etc.
The possessive affix -é develops into -i, a formative affix of place names.
In the usage of ordinal numbers a new affix appears: -ik (for example, harmadik [third]).
In the conjugation of verbs all the modes and tenses are used.
To express past actions and happenings narrative past (mene, láta) and compound past continuous (megy vala) were often used.
To describe permanent conditions participles with affixes -va/-ve, -ván/-vén. -atta/-ette were used instead of verbs.
Even more, personal suffixes were added to them. For example, in the Vienna codex: nézvéjek = õk nézték [they watched it]; in the Munich codex: aluvánk = aludtunk [we were sleeping]; in the Vienna codex: elmenettem = elmentem [I have gone], lakattam = laktam [I lived]; in the Munich codex: evezettek = eveztek [they were rowing]...etc.
To express future not only the present tense is used, but also with the help of auxiliary verbs with the ending -nd, and 'fog' [will].
In the usage of modes and tenses of verbs a strong Latin influence can be felt: the verbal predicates of subordinated sentences are often in conditional mode, instead of affirmative or imperative modes, which would be more accurate according to Hungarian grammar. For example, in the Vienna codex: "midõn a király víg volna" [when the king would be merry]; in the Jókai codex: "parancsolá, hogy semmit ne szólna" [he ordered that he would not say anything]...etc.
The inflection of nouns shows the increase of the number of suffixes.
It is the first time the suffix -szor/-szer/-ször appears; -ként becomes a suffix as well, from the word kéj, kény; and -kor also becomes a suffix originating from the noun kor.
New suffixes are -nként/-nkéd; -stul/-stül; -lan/-len.
Besides the -i suffix, indicating plural possessive in case of nouns, -ai/-ei, then -jai/-jei also appears.
In plural possessive nominal structures the plural could be expressed by the signified noun, too. For example, embereknek házuk [people's houses].
The structures of sentences varied in this period.
In the text relics we can find every kind of sentences.
Concerning simple sentences the most popular ones were the affirmative sentences, but different forms of questions, exclamations and wishes were also used.
For example, in the Vienna codex: "Avajha eladattatánk" [If only we could sell it]; in the Munich codex: "Jaj, tinektek" [Woe is you/ Oh, dear], "Ne akarj félned" [Don't be afraid]...etc.
Sentences were separated by periods or commas, or no punctuation was used at all.
Question and exclamation marks were not known then.
The predicate of a sentences could often be a participle. For example, in the Jókai codex: "õ vala jövendõ" [he was going to come]; in the Munich codex: "Valának evõk és ivók" [There were people eating and drinking]; "valának csudálkodók" [there were people wondering]...etc.
The agreement of the subject and the verb in number often follows the Latin pattern: after a quantitative or collective subject there is usually a plural verb. For example, in the Munich codex: "hallák a két tanítvány" [the two students heard}; "a gyülekezet egybe gyülekezének" [the congregation gathered together]...etc.
In sentences the verb and the participles could be complemented with an object or different adverbials - as before.
The number of free adverbials increases, and number of fixed adverbials referring to abstract relations also grew.
Concerning the complements of nouns, qualitative adjectives are often nouns (names of materials, colours, different kinships and jobs).
This situation urged the appearance of double parts of speech (noun-adjectives).
New types of (adjectival) participles also appeared: hallandó = hallásra alkalmas [ears suitable for hearing] fülek, keresendõ [something to look for], szeretendõ alázatosság [loveable obedience]; tisztelendõ fiú [a boy to be respected]...etc.
The participle való complemented with an adverb was often used as adjective: in the Jókai codex: "Szent sebekrõl való csuda" [a miracle about holy hands], in the Beszterce word list: "mívesnek való étek? [food for an artist]..etc.
Words with qualitative adjectives are often in the plural, after Latin pattern. For example: harminc napok [thirty days], két latrok [two rascals]...etc.
In structures with possessive adjectives the number of emphatic suffixes -nak/-nek increased: Izraelnek fiai, Szamaritánusoknak városai [sons of Israel, cities of the Samaritans}...etc.
Appositions are relatively rare.
Their role is to create an atmosphere and define the signified word more accurately.
Complements to adjectives are frequently used.
These are always adverbs, often with fixed structures, and they express different abstract relations.
There were only a very few complements to cardinal numbers and adverbs.
Concerning compound sentences, all the modern types of subordinate or co-ordinate clauses were in use.
This fact also proves that the language of this period was suitable for expressing various meanings and logical relations.
Latin influence is very strong in the agreement of mode and time of clauses.
Separation from the Latin language began only in the next period of linguistic history.
LITERATURE
THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION
The language
The age of the Angevine rulers brought a significant change in the history of literature in Hungary: originally the mother tongue of the ruling family was French-Italian, and their political and cultural intentions were defined by the origin of the dynasty throughout the age.
The Italian relationships had their effects first of all on the style, interest and genres of Latin literature.
The range of genres in literature became impoverished, compared to that of the age of the Árpád dynasty, but the tone of literature became secular.
The language of literature remained Latin in most cases: historical literature was written mostly in Latin, but besides this several works were written in German at the court.
The Saxon mastersinger, Heinrich of Mügeln, compiled the history of the Hungarian people in his mother tongue, based on one of the Hungarian chronicles.
But not only foreigners wrote in German: historical records were done in German at Szepesszombat throughout the 14th century, and around 1370 the Saxons of Szepes wrote down their law book (Zipser Willkür) in their mother tongue, too.
After 1405 the German citizens of Buda did the very same thing (The Law Book of Buda).
Moreover, the expansion of Hungarian literature can also be dated to this century.
In its background there was the secularisation of church culture, and its authors were the current movers of the lay movement, the monks of begging orders, who made Latin translations for nuns who did not speak Latin.
According to some views, the Hungarian translation of the biography St Margaret of the Árpád dynasty, who was very popular with the Dominican nuns, was written at the beginning of the 14th century by a nun, who spoke Latin. It was probably rewritten in the second half of the century.
At the end of the century this was followed by the first complete Hungarian codex, the Jókai codex with the translation of the legend of St Francis.
We must not forget about the activities of the evangelising begging orders, since their preachings were the transmitting media of ecclesiastic culture and the creators of the standard Hungarian literary language at the same time.
It is also very important that around 1420-30 two priests from the Szerémség , Thomas, an altar priest from Kamanc, and Bálint Újlaki, the parish priest of Belcsény, who got acquainted with the teachings of Hussitism at the university of Prague, translated the bigger part of the Bible into Hungarian.
Their translation was preserved by later copies (the Vienna codex around 1450, the Munich codex from 1466, the Apor codex at the end of the 15th century).
The birth of the Hussite Bible was the sign of a new spiritual wave and the requirement of new demands, according to which religion became a personal issue in contrast to earlier collective forms.
The movement of the Franciscans - who stayed within the boundaries of the church - was supplemented with Husz's teachings, though in concert with official opinions, it was against the philosophy of the church.
Word lists, which give the Hungarian equivalents of Latin expressions are proof of the close relationship between the mother tongue and Latin. They are also important sources of the history of the language.
The first such list was born between 1380-1410, when George of Slavonia copied the Beszterce word list, which contained 1316 words grouped around different topics.
At the same time, before 1410 an unknown copier made the Schlägl word list, which kept the thematic order, but the number of words included are over two thousand.
These might have been made for educational purposes, in contrast to Student John of Rotenburg's Latin coursebook, in which he provided Hungarian word lists for foreigners, probably Germans, It was made between 1418-1422 at Buda.
The explanations were the Latin and German definitions of the most important Hungarian expressions, which were necessary to make contact with people in Hungary.
Oral traditions and secular literature
Besides literacy, oral tradition also presented some reliable sources.
Till the end of Sigismund's reign there must have been some historical songs, that told the heroic deeds of a certain nobleman.
In János Thuróczy's chronicle the author tells the story how the nobleman Stephen Kont - who rebelled against King Sigismund - faced his hangman in 1388, referring to Hungarian historical songs.
In the 16th century there were some songs about Felician Záh's murderous attempt, and similar ones about Pipó Ozorai.
The fragment of a song about Lawrence Tar's visions, who descended to the Irish St Patrick's purgatory in 1411, was also included in Sebestyén Tinódi's chronicle written in verse.
Although the Toldi legend is a later literary relic, which was written down only in the 16th century, its elements clearly show that the basic story was formed during Sigismund's reign at the latest, and the model it followed was the popular French genre of the age, the chanson de geste.
These examples of court literature are partly the relics of historical folk songs, partly the works of Latin court poetry , which survived in translation.
In all probability the legends and adventure stories created by 11-13th-century chroniclers reached the authors of folk epics through secular minstrels and poets, and vice versa: the figure of St Ladislaus, who was resurrected from his tomb and helped the Hungarians against the Turks, might have also been transmitted from folk songs to historical literature.
The spread of literacy: nonprofessional literacy
The 14th century is known as the age when literacy spread widely.
Several priests thought to make good use of their knowledge in a worldly career: so the Latin clericus (= clergyman, member of the clerical order) gradually became the synonym of litteratus (= learned, educated, lettered person) and the Hungarian word meaning student [deák].
At first these persons who left the clergy were employed as clerks at credible places or boroughs (like Bartholomew, clerk of Vasvár and Stephen, the head of the credible place at Pannonhalma), but during the century the royal chancellery also hired secular men who were able to read and write (for example, Master Stephen of Õr), and the offices of the Royal High Court of Justice were regularly headed by lay judges (for example, Jacob Szepesi, later Chief Magistrate of the country).
The appearance of secular educated men damaged the prestige of those who did not leave the church.
It was probably due to the conflict of the two social layers that in the middle of the 14th century Master John Uzsai tried to exclude clerks (students) from the circle of people who enjoyed the privileges of priests.
Besides secular intellectuals, who lived on their ability to read and write, and sometimes made a good career, there were the representatives of aristocracy, such as Benedict Himfi, who corresponded with his friends belonging to begging orders and his villeins in Temes in Latin, and was also the minister of King Louis at the Papal court of Avignon.
The interest in begging orders and lay culture were closely interwoven in his personality.
The expansion of space
Lawrence Tar might have composed his letter to the members of his family personally.
In the age of the Árpád dynasty the representatives of secular society could get in contact with western aristocracy only through royal weddings.
In the 14th century not only foreigners came to Hungary, but King Louis I's Italian campaigns and King Sigismund's European travels and the expanded diplomatic and religious contacts also created brilliant opportunities for the Hungarian aristocracy to meet the Italian, French, English culture in their homelands and adopt the traditions, world view and philosophy there.
Louis' Hungarian leaders of mercenary troops often stayed in Italy after finishing the campaign, and Sigismund's lords took advantage of the ruler's willingness to travel to learn about western culture.
A significant sign of this was the increase of interest in literature and the demand to get to know it.
The visions of Lawrence Tar - who, as it was mentioned above, could read and write - show that the lord, who came back from St Patrick's hell, (independent of the clerk, who wrote down these visions) must have known western visionary literature.
Enterprises abroad broadened the mind of ecclesiastic authors: there are evidences in John Kétyi's work about King Louis's campaigns that the author himself took part in the events.
Education
In the age of the Angevine rulers, after the receding of the chaotic decades at the beginning of the century, Hungarian students still preferred foreign universities.
At the end of the age of the Árpád dynasty most students preferred Italian universities to those of Paris, and this situation did not change even in the 14th century. According to contemporary data students studied law at Italian universities, either in Bologna or Padua, although it is also known that there were three students who got their magister's degree in Paris in 1366.
After the campaigns against Naples, King Louis started to send his young followers and chaplains to the best-known law schools, and during the time of their studies he took care of them through ecclesiastical incomes.
This is how Bálint Alsáni, Benedict Himfi junior, Emeric Czudar and John Kanizsai completed their studied in Italy and as a result of their results, made a successful career.
Besides the famous old schools new ones also appeared: the universities in Prague (1348), in Cracow (1364) and the universities of Vienna (1365).
These universities were visited by Hungarian students in great numbers: the university of Prague from the 1380s, the university of Krakow from the beginning of the 15th century, the university of Vienna from 1368. At this latter one the Natio Hungarica, an organisation uniting Central-European students, was formed in 1384.
In 1367 at the request of King Louis, Pope Orban V agreed to set up the university of Pécs, where humanities and law were taught till 1390, when it was closed.
Among the chancellors (e.g.: Bálint Alsáni, Bishop of Pécs) and lecturers (e.g.: Galvano di Bologna) of the university there were ex-students and lecturers of the university of Bologna.
After its closing up the students were taken over by the university of Prague. For example, Peter Wyderai, who took his 'baccalarius' degree at Pécs in the 1380s.
King Sigismund's aim might have been to replace the university of Pécs, when around 1390 he started to found a university at Óbuda.
The university was accepted in 1395 by Pope Bonifac IX, who appointed Lucas Szántai, Prepost of Óbuda, as the first chancellor.
After a long period of hesitation, the university was refounded in 1410, when four faculties were established with the privileges of the Paris, Bologna, Oxford and Cologne universities.
Students could study theology, both kinds of law, medicine and humanities.
The university, that also had its own coat-of-arms, took part at the synod of Constanz with its four faculties.
The university of Óbuda was also closed after a short boom at the beginning of the 15th century, so the main reason for founding the Academia Istropolitana was that Hungary did not have a university.
Concerning the colleges of begging orders, the Dominicans' Buda college (end of the age of the Árpád dynasty) was followed by the studium generale of the Franciscans in Esztergom, which was mentioned by sources since 1411.
Secular persons could still obtain their practical knowledge at chapter schools.
In some of these the standard of education was very high in the 14-15th centuries.
The records of the 1397 Esztergom church visits regulated the duties of reading canon (lectors), who was engaged in spreading literacy then, and those of his deputy (sublector), who directed the chapter school, in details. It underlined the fact that the school should teach poor students and the relatives of the canon free of charge.
The range of education varied from teaching reading and writing to the teaching of arts at universities, where a big emphasis was put on the art of composition (which also included the basic skills of literary creation!), a branch that developed from ancient rethoric.
In the middle of the 14th century the reading canon of the chapter school of Eger, John Uzsai, compiled his own collection of sample texts for this, and between 1419-1423 Tomas Zákáni, the teacher of the Esztergom school, made his four students copy a codex which summarised the contemporary material taught.
Besides chapter schools, the system of colleges - connected to university education - was also a great help in education.
On the one hand there was independent teaching in the college, on the other hand the institution gave financial support to its students for their further studies.
At the end of the 14th century in the chapter of Esztergom John Budai, the chief dean of Bars, established a foundation from the income of four of his houses at Buda, called Collegium Christi pauperum scolarium (= Christ College of poor students), the aim of which was to support the studies of poor, but talented students.
The institution, which was approved by Pope Bonifac IX in 1399, functioned well till the middle of the 16th century: its own library enabled the students to absorb deeply in the sciences.
Books and libraries
Since the 14th century books were not treasures any more as they became available for more and more people.
The demand for books required cheap production, so by the end of the century paper codices appeared and instead of the earlier decorative writings (textualis) the practical writing (cursiva) - used in charters - was used in codices.
The place of writing was not the scriptorium of monasteries any more, but the copy room of the royal court, the manufacture of universities, where textbooks were made; in other words secular copying places.
Just a few decorative codices survived, which might refer to the fact that demands have changed: the emphasis was put on the contents.
There was a copy room at the court of the Angevine rulers, the products of which have been preserved.
The Illustrated Chronicle and the Secreta secretorum codex, which is kept in Oxford, were made in the 1370s at a very high standard. Their miniator was identified as Nicholas Meggyesi.
The same can be told about the decorated Bible of bishop and cardinal Demeter Nekcsei.
It is possible that the Hungarian Angevine Legendarium was also made here.
These manuscripts were made for presents or for the education of a member of the ruling family, so not for practical but representational purposes.
In contrast practical codices were very simple and undecorated, they were made in Franciscan and Augustine scriptoriums.
As the secular demands put the emphasis of teaching writing on chapter schools, chapter libraries became more and more significant.
Several lists of books survived from the chapter of Veszprém from the first third of the 15th century, and the list of the Pozsony chapter - from the same time - is also known.
We can see from these lists that chapter libraries tried to satisfy practical demands to a greater extent.
The majority of the books mentioned were law books, that helped practical education in the school and the jurisdiction of chief deans living in the chapter.
Besides these there were theological and liturgical books, rarely some books from Cicero or Aristotle, and the works of medieval chroniclers.
At the beginning of the 15th century there were 225 books in the book list of the Zagreb chapter, the majority of them were liturgical books, or works about preaching and church government, but we could find some university course books, too.
It can be claimed that the books of chapters represent the book products of the previous two or three centuries.
The library of the 24th parish priests' brotherhood (confraternities) of Szepes must have been of a similar type.
AUTHORS, GENRES, WORKS
The new awareness of life
The 14th century was the age of great change throughout Europe.
The world is still medieval, but it is governed by rulers, who were touched by the new world.
Louis the Great and his barons usually chose their confessors from among the Franciscans, who were the disseminators of a new religious life as authors of literary works.
As the religion became personal and private, it foreshadowed a new world view. This was humanism, which focused on the individual.
Although the educated people were still enthusiastic about court culture, the signs of a new awareness of life could also be seen: King Louis corresponded with the poet Petrarca and Coluccio Salutati, the famous Florentine chancellor.
The humanist of Padua, Giovanni da Ravenna, was born in Hungary as the son of King Louis's doctor.
King Sigismund invited Pier Paolo Vergerio to Hungary, who was the most outstanding forerunner of humanism.
Dante's Divina Commedia, the first work of the early Renaissance was known in Hungary at the time of Louis the Great, and its Latin translation was sent to Hungary for King Sigismund by Giovanni Serravalle.
Hungarians abroad, foreigners in Hungary
Latin as the mother tongue of literature and the church provided good chances for Hungarian authors who went abroad.
After finishing his studies in Paris, from 1302, the Augustine Alexander of Hungary became the Magister of the university. His opinions were often quoted by his students, who wrote commentaries.
We know several works of Herbord of Hungary, he wrote commentaries to psalms and sermons and an essay against heretics.
His activity as a writer contributed to the fact that he became Bishop of Bergamo at the end of his life.
At the end of the 14th century Ladislaus of Hungary (Ladislaus Ungarus) taught in Vienna; he wrote an essay on how to look after hunting hawks.
Foreign authors still kept coming to Hungary in great numbers.
Heinrich of Mügeln, German mastersinger must have gone to Buda after leaving the court of the Czech king and emperor.
At the latest in 1333 he summarised Hungarian history for his patron, Rudolf IV, Austrian prince, in his mother tongue. Besides the Stephen legend of Hartvic his source was a chronicle version, whose references to the age of Géza II and Stephen III have been lost in their original form for today.
Around 1361 he offered his Latin historical work, the Rhythmic Chronicle for King Louis I, in which he compiled the history of the Hungarian people till 1072 in four parts, written in different rhythmic and rhyming phases.
Lorenzo de Monacis was a Venetian minister at Queen Mary's court, so he might have written his epic poem about the unsuccessful reign of Charles (Little) II (Carmen seu historia de Carlo II cognomento Pravo, rege Hungariae) here, which he offered to the Queen. Thuróczy adopted this into his chronicle in prose.
The relics of historiography from the age of the Angevine rulers
The Minorite of Buda from the age of Charles
The 14th century was the golden age of interest in the past, and historical literature dominates literature due to its richness of genres and extent.
The population of cities and members of ecclesiastic institutions start to record historic memories at that time (for example, the Szepesszombat Chronicle).
The representatives of the new religion, the Franciscans brought great changes to Hungarian historiography in the age of the Angevine rulers.
In the first half of the 1330s a new demand appeared for a comprehensive national history, in contrast with the earlier monographic gestas.
In all probability a Franciscan from Buda, whose name is unknown, united the relics of historiography of the end of the 13th century, that is Simon Kézai's and Master Ákos's works, and he continued the text till 1334.
As an author he not only continued the summary of history, but also created a new part: horrified by Felician Záh's deed he wrote the story about ban Bánk.
The author was strongly influenced by his inclination to tell anecdotes - which is typical of Franciscan historiography.
This might be the reason why some episodes were discussed in details: how King Otto lost his crown, how the people of Buda excommunicated the Pope, or how King Charles changed clothes with Dezsõ Szécsi.
Though there is some looseness in the structure, its style is lively, he deliberately uses the rhythmic prose, similies, metaphors and adventurous turns. Seemingly the aim of the author was to fascinate his readers with his art.
His work did not survive in its individual form, only the codices of the Buda Chronicle preserved it.
The Illustrated Chronicle
In 1358 - probably at the King's request - another historiographic work was born, the aim of which was to show Hungarian history in a representative form.
Though he did not name himself, the author is thought to be Mark Kálti, canon of Székesfehérvár, who was in charge of the royal treasury and archives.
His method was the same as that of earlier chroniclers: he partly united earlier texts, and partly included new paragraphs.
He used popular structures of the age of Charles as the basis of his work and interpolated shorter or longer texts from earlier chronicles into it.
In all probability he was the first editor, who used the old gesta called Gesta Ladislai regis, which was written at King Coloman's court, and put this in the focus of his work.
By doing so he made King St Ladislaus, the ideal of court culture of the Angevine rulers, the hero of the chronicle.
He adopted long parts from a gesta written in the age of Stephen III.
We can see from the work that the author was a court priest.
His views and methods of writing were strongly influenced by the ideals he wanted to represent.
He wrote a prologue in front of his work, which might as well be a short essay, in which he summarised the essence of the ideal of the king - which substituted the ideal of the state of the Angevine age. According to this, all power is from God, and God places the kings on their thrones to govern their people in peace and welfare, following the model of God Heavenly kingdom, and this way bring the souls in front of God to be judged.
At the end of the Middle Ages the ideal ruler of the Carolingian age was clearly shown here.
The author must have been highly educated, especially in theology, as in his prologue he refers to Petrus Comestor, the "Master of History" (magister historiarum = he is represented on the famous miniature of the Illustrated Chronicle) besides other authors. He also quotes from him and Nicolas de Lyra as well.
With its tone, style and deliberate structure, the chronicle shows that its author lived at the court and was very different from his Minorite ancestor concerning their world views.
His work did not survive in its original form, only in a copied manuscript from around 1370, which was probably a present for someone. This version stops at the events of 1330 (some say it was because of Mark Kálti's death). It was also preserved in the chronicle family of the Illustrated Chronicle.
John Küküllei
The real change of historic view was shown by the appearance of the genre of biography.
John Küküllei, who started as a secular literate man at the royal court then continued his career in the church from the first half of the 1350s, started to write a biographical work, entitled Chronicon de Ludovico rege, in the 1360s. In the first 25 chapters he summarised the events of the campaigns against Naples as a witness.
After 1382 he complemented his work with 30 more chapters, in which he focused on the old King's deeds and characteristic features.
He followed the model of the biography of King St Louis (IX), who was respected by the Angevine rulers, written by Guillelmus de Nangis.
It is typical of Küküllei that as a member of the chancellery he could read charters, so he included parts from charters (arengas, narratives) in his work word by word to a great extent.
At the same time he did not refrain from changing some facts in order to create an ideal picture of the ruler.
His work is the modern version of early medieval royal mirrors and late medieval biographies of holy kings, in which the material is modified by the ideal he wanted to represent.
The author applied a clear and careful structure and regularly used rhythmic prose.
His sources were King Louis's favourite reading, the Secreta secretorum, in which the hero is compared to Alexander the Great (the codex of this, which was made at King Louis's court, is kept in Oxford), and he also refers to Aristotle and Vegetius.
Küküllei's work did not survive in an independent form, but it was included in the Buda and Dubnic Chronicles besides John Thuróczy's chronicle.
The Unknown Minorite
In the focus of the fragment of a chronicle, which survived in the text of the Dubnic Chronicle, we can also find the detailed description of the events at Naples.
It was verified long ago that it was part of a longer, independent chronicle, the author of which must have been a Franciscan monk living in the King's environment, who wrote his work between 1345-1355.
With full knowledge of these facts the focus of attention turned to John (Egri) Kétyi, who was the confessor of the king and his mother.
The author insisted on the Franciscan tradition of historiography, the work was based on the author's inclination to tell anecdotes, and not on a planned structure.
As a result of this he recorded many detailed, short story like anecdotes and the local events.
Its language and tone is sometimes rough (he recorded a Hungarian sporadic relic!), but he also tries to fascinate the reader with his turns of style and richness of metaphors.
His Latin differs from the usual, in contrast to rhythmic, it is rather archaic, so he prefers folk-like rhymed prose.
He starts the story with the murder of Prince Andrew, and prepares the reader for further events emotionally.
In his work he focuses on the ideal of court culture, which makes the final sense when he tells the story of Ladislaus, the Angevine rulers holy king, when he resurrected from his tomb in Várad to help Andrew Lackfi's troops.
In the spirit of this the story becomes the series of reviews of troops, duals and individual deeds, which makes the work of the unknown Minorite special in medieval Hungarian literature.
The beginnings of church history
In the first half of the 14th century the interest in the past of certain church institutions began to grow.
Around 1334 in Zagreb the statututes of chapters were compiled, headed with a chronicle telling history from the foundation of the chapter till 1354, as historical background.
Where the chronicle mentions national events it summarises 14th-century chronicles.
According to the Zagreb Chronicle in 1374 Emeric, the reading canon of Várad (1370-1376), put the same chronicle at the head of the statututes of the Várad chapters (Várad Chronicle), but he corrected the text of the Zagreb Chronicle (Chartularium capituli Varadiensis) in concert with one of the codices of the Buda Chronicle and supplemented that with the list of bishops of Várad.
The latter text tells the events from the foundation in the age of St Ladislaus till 1354.
The first part of both text survived in a broken form, and the second part consists of 22 chapters.
The Franciscans' interest in the history of their order was probably influenced by the effort of the strict branch of the order to verify their existence and viewpoint with the facts of the past.
Balázs Szalkai, the eleventh vicar of the Bosnian order (1420-1433), which was founded in 1339, started to collect the material: he compiled the list of vicars and the documents of the order.
The person who continued this work adopted the precedents of the foundation from the universal history of the order, then later he obtained data from the traditions of the order and other sources.
From this work, which started with the event of 1313, we know that in the 1320s Hungarian Franciscans joined the dispute of Papacy and begging orders, and several of them wrote essays on whether it was heresy or not to preach about common property.
Religious literature
Sermon-literature
The Buda, Dubnic chronicles and John Thuróczy's chronicle preserved specially detailed and colourful descriptions about King Charles's death and funeral.
In spite of the fact that the story was written down later, the author was undoubtedly a contemporary witness, whose introductory words were followed by the funeral farewell speech by Archbishop Csanád Telegdi.
For the author this latter one gave the inspiration to compose his own thoughts.
In addition to the fact that emotional impressions were replaced with rethoric pictures, the structure and chain of thoughts of the archbishop's speech and his method of reasoning shows a surprising relationship with those of the Funeral Oration and Prayer. The only reason for this could be that the structure of speech made over the dead body became a liturgic formula in Hungary from the early Middle Ages.
The most popular genre among educated priests was necessarily the sermon, preaching, which made the clergy the transmitters of literature.
The role of preaching priests in raising folk language to the level of literature was very significant.
Although there were several reports about Hungarian authors who wrote sermons we have only a few relics.
Hagiography: the Gerald legend
In spite of the fact that the admiration of saint kings was booming at the court of the Angevine rulers, dealing with the biography of saints meant copying codices in the age of the Angevine dynasty, and only a few original works survived.
Reliable data prove that near St Stephen's tomb, under the supervision of the canon of Székesfehérvár, in the royal treasury a special codex of the Hartvic-type St Stephen legend was kept, which was considered authentic throughout the whole country.
This may be the reason why the Abbot of Pannonhalma sent the convent clerk to Székesfehérvár in 1349 to have a certain part of the Stephen legend copied into a charter at the credible place of the local chapter. This part was about the donation of the tithes of Somogy to Pannonhalma.
When in the same year Louis ordered the chapter of Székesfehérvár to examine the St Stephen legend in the matter of the freedom of the Cracow castle villeins, the chapter answered that he could not perform this duty as Louis's father had the legend brought to Visegrád.
There certainly is some originality in the St Gerald legend, which was written at the end of the 14th century based on a 12th-century ancient text.
The work called the Larger Legend summarised the early text, recomposed the text in many places, sometimes with smaller interpolations, and finally there was a supplementary part about Gerald's miracles.
In the last chapter the unknown author describes that Queen Elisabeth, King Charles I's widower was cured by Gerald, so she had a decorated silver coffin made for Gerald's relics.
Finally he noted down that Elisabeth died in 1381 (according to modern time in 1380) and she was buried in the Clarissan cloister of Buda, which she founded herself.
Maybe it was Queen Elisabeth's admiration of Gerald and the demands of the court that encouraged the making of the new legend.
The story about how Hermit St Paul's relics were brought over to Hungary
At the start of the war with Venice Louis I promised that if he won he would have the relics of the denominative saint of the Pauline order brought over to Hungary.
Finally in 1381 the king made peace with Venice, and in concert with the peace treaty he had the bones of St Paul, the Theban Hermit brought over to Buda. He had these placed to the central monastery of the Pauline order in Budaszentlõrinc in the midst of a bright celebration.
On this occasion a literary work was written, entitled 'Historia de translatione Sancti Pauli Thebaei cognimento primi eremitatae', which told the story how the relics were brought over connected to the traditions of medieval hagiography which ordered the recording not only the biography of saints but also to keep their bones as evidence. The genre of this work of art was translatio, and it survived in Pauline breviaries.
This short historical work was made as the next part of St Jerome's St Paul biography.
It consists of seven chapters, which tells the story how the relics were brought to Venice through Constantinople, it also tells of the king's promise and order of the peace treaty, and finally how Bálint Alsáni, Bishop of Pécs and Paul Hortáti, Bishop of Zagreb brought the relics home to Hungary and put them in their final place.
The author must have belonged to the environment of the learned Bishop of Pécs.
The world of thoughts in this short work shows the ideas connecting court culture with the early renaissance: it focuses on the desire to be famous and heroic, and the praise of the important and amiable (insignis et amoenissmius) natural environment.
Its style can be characterised by chancellery type sequence of sentences, but we can find the desire for persuasion in each of its words (pulcher v. decorus stylus, affatus facundus).
Visionary literature
The folk-secular branch of religious literature, that is, visionary literature has left hardly any trace in Hungarian Latin literature.
But it left its trace at places, where the visions of the Hungarians were noted down with the purpose of making it authentic.
Since the 12th century the favourite place of pilgrims who were attracted to miraculous revelations was St Patrick's Irish purgatory, a sulphureous cave in the province of Ulster.
Several Hungarian people visited this, but only two pilgrimages were recorded in contemporary literature: George (Krizsafán's son)'s pilgrimage in 1353 and Lawrence Tar's in 1411.
An unknown Augustine author wrote about the visions of the pilgrim from the age of the Angevine rulers, and the royal clerk of Dublin recorded the revelations of King Sigismund's baron, who also included Lawrence Tar's own notes in his work.
Both visionary stories contain visions which seem to be original, but there are several ones, which might originate from the themes of the manual for visitors of hell, the 12th-century story of Knight Oenus.
There is the evidence of Lawrence Tar's pilgrimage in literature other than the Dublin notes.
In connection with Hungarian court epic we had already mentioned that at the beginning of the 15th century a Hungarian song about Master Lawrence's visions must have been born, but also there was a Latin song about him.
The literary value of these examples of visionary literature is quite high: on the one hand the openness of genre offers a large scope to the authors imagination, the simple story becomes literature.
On the other hand the personal voice of religious doubt in the stories prepared the way for a new world of ideas, called humanism, with its individual viewpoint.
Literary works: charters, letters, formula books
The 14-15th centuries was the period of the development of the practice of making charters.
The different types of medieval charters have developed and the formulae of separate types became fixed and permanent.
School books have had their effects on their style.
Letters with private tones also appeared, and became the forerunners of modern private and missile letters.
The material of relics became richer not only in quality but also in the social aspect.
We can see noblemen writing their own letters (Benedict Himfi, Lawrence Tar) and the most typical figure of the age: the clerk [student], the secular literate man, who - in the possession of his knowledge - undertook forging charters, too (damned clerk John).
Jurisdiction became a wide-spread and permanent practice, and many relics survived, the content of which was built up in concert with the rules of making charters.
The main institute of court literacy, the chancellery became rather official.
At that time, vice-chancellor Tatamér had the identifications of the chancellery written on the charter itself so that responsibility could be identified, then the text was recorded in registers (later called royal books).
During the 14th century the institute of chancellery was strongly differentiated, different matters were dealt at different departments.
Besides credible places in the countryside the organisation of court literacy started to function: it was the royal chapel.
The new style of the chancellery can be exemplified by the deeds of gift, which recorded the event when King Charles gave Felician Zách's estates away.
This sentence also referred to his relatives and descendants through generations.
The violence of crime and punishment was represented in the chronicles, too, but the objection of the court was echoed by narrations of charters for years. These charters did not emphasise the merits of the donor (their duty should have been this), but they described the wickedness of the assassin by applying a lot of rhetoric figures, interesting scenes and surprising turns.
We can find the most dramatic description in the juristic document (proscription) of the assassin from the year 1330.
After the description of the hopelessness of the decade following the extinction of the Árpád dynasty, the composer of the charter contrasted it with the peace of the age of Charles - creating tension with this.
Then he quickly started to write about the murderous attempt: Felician, possessed by the fox-like devil (vulpinae dolositatis astutia), the ill and impudent dog (morbidus et impudicus canis) - whose name is connected to 'pain' etymologically; he was also called or rather nicknamed unhappy (Infelicianus) - was not ashamed to satisfy his meanness by killing, and wanted to kill the whole royal family.
Because of his deed he became hatred not only by the divine wife, but also by all the people of the Earth and Heaven. The punishment was inflicted on him by God's holy right.
Formula books helped to teach how to compose charters. These were made in the workshops of literacy in great numbers.
There are 14 (charter) drafts in the codex which preserved the Gyulafehérvár lines, which were compiled by Franciscan monks around 1320 at Székesfehérvár.
In this collection we can find complete charters in connection with the government of the order and preaching.
The other relic survived in Bartholomew Tapolcai's codex, which contained university notes. The owner copied an unbroken collection of 34 pieces - the pieces of which were connected by the topic - into it around 1385, which was supposed the make judgement easier for the chief dean in cases of marriage.
Besides formula books there were rhetorical and law school books as well in Hungary.
Between 1346-51, after his studies and being a dean at Bologna, the leader of the chapter school of Eger, reading canon John Uzsai compiled a course book with references to real legal cases. His aim was to help teach practical law, and this, of course, included the introduction to the art of writing.
His Parisian type ars dictaminis, or rather ars notaria consisted of a prologue and four parts. It was actually used in the chapter of Eger in the next one hundred years. Besides the theoretical grammatical pieces of advice, which were based on the late antique grammatics of Donatus, it contains different formulae of charters, which included the most generally used charter types.
Poetry
Even though hagiography was poor in the 14th century, liturgic poetry was booming.
There were hymns, sequences, rhyming prayers from this time proclaiming the glory of Hungarian saints.
Unknown authors wrote sequences about the saints of the Árpád dynasty, which fitted the interest of the Angevine rulers: about Kings St Stephen and St Ladislaus, St Elisabeth, a hymn about King St Stephen, a rhyming prayer about Prince St Emeric.
At the same time the canons of Esztergom composed an antiphony in a 14-line distichon in honour of the patron saint of their cathedral, St Adalbert.
The monk authors strengthened the consciousness of connectedness of the order by their poem about the saints of the order. A Pauline author wrote a sequence about Hermit St Paul, and around 1300 a Dominican poet wrote the office of St Margaret.
The memory of the Leonine hexameter survived in John Thuróczy's chronicle.
After the funeral farewell speech by Csanád Telegdi, before John Küküllei's chronicle there is a 15-line text written in hexameters about King Charles's death. It might have been written by a contemporary author, just like the prosaic farewell speech.
Secular lyrics completed itself in Heinrich of Mügeln's poem about Hungarian history.
All the parts (consisting of several verses) of the famous master singer's Rhyming Chronicle were different and specific in their verse form, and it was accompanied by an independent melody (which also survived).
The poet noted when the melody and the verse were not his own, but adopted from a contemporary poet.
In the era when culture became rather secular, in some works of medieval poetry church critique also appeared.
Around 1310 a Hungarian clergyman wrote a poem, entitled the 'Priests' lament' (Planctus clericorum), which described Hungarian fights for the throne, the Pope's intervention and the undeserved richness of Hungarian prelates with miserable words.
The same collection from Styria preserved the other poem, the 'Rambling student's lament', which was written by another clergyman or clerk, which described the pityful life of learned students who did not get a job, and the rottenness of the world in sad verses.
With these poems, with the strong voice of critique, medieval lyrics met the demands of the renaissance.
ARTS
THE HISTORY OF ARTS
Art in the Early Angevine Age (1300-1350)
Introduction
The chaotic history of the first quarter of the century was not ideal for the arts.
People usually spent their money on building fortresses and defending themselves.
Hospes settlements founded in the 13th century became more influential where new - though simple and conservative - churches were built in great numbers.
The king, the church and the new aristocracy started to support the arts only from the 1330s.
Architecture followed the late Gothic style of French origin in Czech and Austrian territories.
The same style prevails in sculpture and partly in painting, too, but we can also feel the influence of the Italian trecento in the new genres, especially in the luxurious environment of the court and prelates.
Architecture
Fortresses
The anarchic situation following the extinction of the Árpád dynasty was beneficial for governors of provinces and their environment.
The fortresses they built at the turn of the century were small stone buildings with towers, stone walls, palace and cistern, which were difficult to approach (for example, the Márévár [Máré castle] before 1316).
They did not care about comfort and splendour.
Near the smaller landlords' mansions wooden fortresses, the so-called mottes were built in even greater numbers. They consisted of moats, fence and a wood tower or house.
During the consolidation of Charles I's power the king obtained the majority of the fortresses. He had many of them destroyed and rarely gave permission for building new ones.
Village churches and monasteries
The first stone churches were built at the turn of the century near the borders, in the new villages, which were founded in the 13th century.
These were simple and conservative buildings, for example in Csorda and Vámosatya in Szatmár, Kakaslomnic and Zsegra in the Szepesség, and Velemér in West-Hungary.
The development of the Pauline hermit order, which originated from Hungary, started at this time. They put their residence into the St Lawrence monastery near Buda.
The landowners also had some churches built, mainly for the modest Paulines, but these buildings were hardly bigger than village churches (Diósgyõr before 1304, Dédes before 1313, Uzsaszentlélek before 1333 and Felnémet in 1347).
The Karthauz hermits also settled down in Hungary: Menedékkõ was built in the Szepesség (before 1308), then the red monastery of Lehnic (1319-1344).
Next to the fortress the people of Siklós built a monastery for the Augustine canons before 1333.
Cathedrals
The reconstruction of cathedrals which were destroyed in the inner conflicts of the preceeding decades started in the 1330s.
Bishop Andrew Szécsi (1320-1356) finished the construction of the 13th-century building of the Gyulafehérvár cathedral.
The single-naved, Gothic cathedral of Nyitra (1333-1355) and the chancel of the Esztergom cathedral (around 1336-1351) were also completed then.
Bishop Andrew Bátori (1329-1345) had a monumental western facade built to the cathedral of Nagyvárad in the 1330s, which consisted of two column-like towers with a choir between them and decorated gates.
The cathedral of Eger was also enlarged with similar western twin towers, thanks to Bishop Miklós Dörögdi (1332-1361).
He himself was buried in the hall between the towers.
To the latter two cathedrals round, chapel-wreath chancels were added before the middle of the century, following French models.
The construction works in Nagyvárad which was started in 1342 lasted till the beginning of the 15th century, the chancel of Eger was probably never completed.
Royal centres
Charles I transferred his residence to Visegrád in 1323.
He removed his court first to the Visegrád fortress, then to a house in the city, in the predecessor of the Visegrád Royal Palace.
Around 1340 they started to build a decorative chapel next to the royal house, but the construction works soon stopped because of the court moving to Buda in 1347.
In 1343 Louis I presented the earlier royal castle in Óbuda to her mother, Queen Elisabeth Piaszt, who established her residence there.
Near the rebuilt castle the Queen had a Clarissan monastery built before 1350, and next to the St Peter prepostery church of Óbuda she had a new church built before 1348 in honour of the Virgin Mary.
At the earlier royal residence in Buda the St Martin chapel was built in 1349 in the Kammerhof, which was built by Charles. So the place became suitable for being the real residence.
The king's brother, the governor of the country, Prince Stephen, had his Buda castle built in the southern part of the city.
Royal church constructions
In 1318 the Székesfehérvár basilica was destroyed by fire.
Charles I had the church rebuilt: he had the pillars strengthened and the main nave vaulted, making a Gothic church from the Roman building.
In 1327 there was another fire, but this time only the roof was destroyed.
At Kolozsmonostor the king had the Árpád age Benedictine abbacy reconstructed.
The simple chancel of the church can still be seen today.
In the 1330-1340s a new chancel was built to the Dominican nunnery at the Margaret Island, which was quite close to the new royal center.
Some time later a splendid divider with sculptures was added to the chancel of the church of the Cistercian monastery of Pilis.
The latter constructions can be connected to the building workshop of the unfinished palace chapel of Visegrád, and all of them represent Central-European late classical Gothic style.
Cities
Several cities finished the construction of their city walls and churches in the first half of the 14th century.
The triple city of Sopron was finished by 1340.
The nave and chancel divider of the Franciscan church of Sopron was built around 1300, and the chapter hall in the first third of the century.
The first synagogue of the city was also finished then.
The chancel of the Clarissan church of Pozsony was built in the 1330s in the same style as the Sopron chapter hall.
Large church halls were built in Igló and Lõcse in the Szepesség.
New chancels were added to the parish church of Nagyszeben and the St Elisabeth church of Kassa. In Kassa a new cemetery chapel was built in honour of St Michael.
The development of estate centres also started.
For example, Thomas Szécsényi founded a Franciscan monastery at Szécsény after 1335.
Fine arts
Sculpture
After the building of the new chancel in the Dominican nunnery of the Margaret Island the tombstone of St Margaret was erected in the second third of the century, which was made by Italian masters.
The same sculptors made the head of a brother, which was found at Visegrád.
The earliest winged altar in Hungary survived from Kríg, the central baldachin of which is surrounded by wings with reliefs.
The Madonna of Pozsonyszölõs followed a French model.
The Madonnas of Toporc and Ruskin, which originate from the second quarter of the century, follow more modern, South-German models.
Besides the Madonnas the wooden sculpture of the age is represented by crucifixes.
The characteristic feature of these is the painful representation of the corp on a living crucifix.
The most beautiful relic from the middle of the century survived from the church of Mateóc in the Szepesség.
Painting
The frescos of Szepeshely, Szepesdaróc and Kakaslomnic show Byzantine influence in their style at the beginning of the century.
The series of frescos of Tereske, however, followed the Central-European Gothic style.
The St Ladislaus legend was a popular theme.
The archbishopric chapel of Esztergom was painted in the 1330s, the chapel of the bishopric palace of Zagreb and the cathedral of Nagyvárad were painted in the 1350s by Central-Italian masters.
The Italian influence was felt in book painting, too, through codices made mainly in Bologna, such as Demeter Nekcsei (keeper of the Treasury)'s Bible or the Angevine Legendarium painted for Prince Andrew.
Minor arts
A fine memory of 14th-century smithery was the ciborium (host container), the sides of which are decorated with carved scenes.
The cross of Igló was similarly decorated.
A portable altar with enamel decorations, which was made in Paris, was in the possession of Queen Elisabeth Piaszt. Later she presented it to the Clarissians of Óbuda.
From secular everyday objects of the age treasure troves and accessories survived from tombs.
Signets were made by smiths.
Besides the series of royal signets, which were of high artistic quality, the signet of the St George Order of Knighthood must be mentioned, since it was very special.
The seals of barons usually represented their coats-of-arms, sometimes knights. The seals of the cities represented their patron saint or walls.
The signets of prelates were often mandorla-shaped and showed the patron saint of the their church.
Art in the Late Angevine Age (1350-1400)
Introduction
At the beginning of the period the most important customers were the Queen Mother, Elisabeth, from the 1370s Louis I, then his daughter, Maria and his husband, King Sigismund.
The booming court culture fitted organically into the international Gothic style of the age.
Italian influence could be felt in each branch of art, but art at the emperor's court in Prague was also very influential.
Peter Parler, who led the constructions in Prague, opened a new stage in Gothic architecture, which had its echoes in Hungary, too.
Besides this there was another variant of the style in Central-Europe, which was rather puritan, spread mainly by begging orders.
The art of the cities had connections with Austria and Little Poland through business relationships.
Architecture
Visegrád
Since the royal court moved back to Visegrád in 1355, Louis I had the earlier royal house enlarged into a palace.
By the 1370s the fortress of Visegrád was also rebuilt.
The reconstructions of the royal palace of Visegrád may have started at the end of the 1370s but were completed by Sigismund around 1400.
The Virgin Mary parish church of the city and the Augustine monastery were also renewed.
Louis I made the palace of Buda his royal residence, as he added a new yard, palace side-wings and a chapel to it from the end of the 1370s.
The giving away of the earlier royal residence, the Kammerhof, in 1382 meant that the palace was ready.
The fortresses which defended the new yard were built during Maria and Sigismund's reign.
The construction of the Gothic chancels of the Mary Magdalene parish church and the St Nicholas Dominican church in the city started at that time.
Bishopric buildings and fortresses
Coloman, Bishop of Gyõr (1336-1375), and Charles I's bastard son, enriched the fortress of Gyõr with an escutcheoned gate-tower.
At Pécs Bishop Miklós Poroszlói founded the Mary chapel in 1355 near the earlier bishopric palace.
In 1360 he was buried here.
His successor, Bishop William (1361-1374) had the palace rebuilt, and maybe placed the university of Pécs - which was also founded by him - here.
He was buried in the Mary chapel, in a pompous tomb with sculpture and baldachin.
Louis I had the fortress of Diósgyõr - with four corner towers - and the fortress of Zólyom - which had no towers- built in the 1370s. Both of the fortresses had a regular square ground plan.
Sigismund's fortress of Végles followed the pattern of the Zólyom fortress.
The fortress of Gesztes, which was also built in the age of Sigismund, had a simple, but regular ground plan and a closed yard between the two side-wings.
The cities of West-Hungary and Upper Hungary
The constructions of Western Hungarian cities followed Viennese patterns.
The tower of the Franciscan church of Sopron, the St Michael parish church and the St George chapel and the new synagogue represent the architecture of the second half of the 14th century.
The western part of the St Martin parish church and the Clarissan church and the St John chapel of the Franciscan church of Pozsony were built at that time, too.
The constructions of the parish church of Lõcse were finished then, but the building of the Nagyszombat church started then.
A new, large Franciscan church was built in Lõcse.
The parish church of Pest was enlarged with a chancel hall.
The new chancel of the Veszprém cathedral and the crypt were built around 1380-1400 with plain details.
Transylvanian cities
The influence of 14th-century Austrian architecture can be felt in Transylvania, too: the patterns of the chancels of the parish church of Szászsebes and the Black church of Brasso and the triple chancel apsis of the parish church of Kolozsvár are from there.
The longitudinal house of the parish church of Nagyszeben was finished in an oldish, basilica form with a transept and a huge square tower was built in front of its western facade, according to local Saxon traditions.
This type of church was built in a smaller form in other Saxon settlements, for example, in Ecel.
The Franciscan church of Marosvásárhely followed the model of the single-naved Franciscan church type with a long chancel, which was wide-spread in the whole country.
Its gates show a slightly old, but richly partitioned form, which was quite popular in Transylvania.
Some other nice examples of this type are the gates of the Calvinist church of Ótorda.
Monasteries
The booming of the Pauline order continued in the second half of the 14th century.
The church of the Tüskevár monastery is similar to the buttress system of church of the Csatka monastery, which was consecrated in 1361.
The three-nave new church of Budaszentlõrinc was built in Sigismund's age, and the rebuilt chancel of the earlier church was reconstructed into Hermit St Paul's relic chapel.
In the market towns, besides the residences of landlords monasteries of the begging orders were built.
The long chancel of the Franciscan church of Keszthely, which was founded by Stephen Lackfi, had already stood in 1397.
The vaulted nave was built at the beginning of the 15th century.
The church of the Premonrean monastery of Lelesz was rebuilt in the 1350-1360s.
Fine arts
Sculpture
Unfortunatelly the Angevine tombstones of Székesfehérvár survived only in fragments.
Though the tombstones of the two abbots, from 1365 and 1372, were preserved unbroken.
The wooden sculptures of the age survived, first of all, in the Highland.
The St Nicholas wooden sculpture of Szelcse is from the region of the mining towns.
The richest series of sculptures in the Szepesség consists of the apostles on the pediment of the main altar of the St Jacob church of Lõcse.
The Madonnas of Szlatvin and Kõperény represent the different types of Madonna sculptures.
St George's bronze statue (1373) - which can be seen in Prague today - and the St Ladislaus equestrian statue of Nagyvárad, which was later destroyed, and the statues of the three saint kings were made by the most significant sculptors of medieval Hungary, Martin and George of Kolozsvár.
Painting
The effects of the Italian trecento still played an important role in the painting of the second half of the century.
It can be proved by the frescos of the chancel of the Keszthely Franciscan church from the end of the 14th century and the frescos of the church of Zsegra in the Highland from the 1360s.
The decoration of the chancel of the church of Csomorja from the Csallóköz represents linear Gothic style, which originates from the west.
In the king-paintings of the St Jacob church of Lõcse and on the St Dorothy cycle we can see the signs of international Gothic style already at the end of the century.
The most outstanding series of frescos were painted by Johannes Aquila, whose main works - in spite of his Styrian origin - survived on the territory of medieval Hungary: in the churches of Velemér (1378), Bántornya (1383 and 1389) and Mártonhely (1392).
Book and tabloid painting
The most important memory of the second half of the 14th century is a painted codex - made by a master who studied in Italy -, the Illustrated Chronicle.
Parish priest Henrich of Csukárd is known by the name; as a miniaturist he decorated a service book (missale) in 1377.
The influence of international Gothic was very strong at the end of the century. It was spread by Czech manuscripts, which were brought into the country, for example, the Chapter of Pozsony, Vencel Ganoy's Bible.
Ladislaus Miskolci's missale (1394) is a relic of this style from Hungary.
The earliest Hungarian tabloids originate from this period. In 1367 Louis I presented three pictures to the Hungarian chapel of Aachen, but today only their frames are original.
More survived from the Madonna picture, presented to Máriacell, which followed Italian patterns.
Minor arts
Several objects of smithery survived from Louis I's court, such as the King's double cross and treasure that he gave to the Hungarian chapel of Aachen: altar equipments, relic holders, escutcheoned cloak clips.
The herm (head relic holder) of Tercsény, originating from the 1380s, represents the popular relic holder type of the age.
St Simeon's silver coffin of Zára was made to the order of the Queen, Bosnian Elisabeth.
The Esztergom paramentum (altar cloth), the embroidery of which represents the figure of the resurrected Christ, might have been brought to the Paulian monastery of Göncruszka as Queen Maria's present.
The mitre (bishop's cap) of Gyõr is a nice example of the liturgic clothes of the age.
Master Conrad Gaal founded the Iglo workshop, which provided great part of the Highland with bells and bronze baptising pools for centuries.
Tile stoves also appeared at that time.
Art in the Late Sigismund-Age (1400-1437)
Introduction
Artistic representation was an important political instrument for King Sigismund.
He tried to create a court in Buda, following western models, appropriate to an emperor.
The French, South-German and Austrian masters participating in royal constructions had epoch-making works both in architecture and sculpture.
The style of royal constructions had a strong influence on the art of several cities and landlord districts.
An artistic region came into being in East-Hungary, along an important trade route, with the centre of Kassa.
The painting of the royal centre was as significant as that of Charles IV's court in Prague.
Italian trends did not disappear from painting, but they were pushed back.
Architecture
Fortresses and palaces
King Sigismund had the fortress of Tata built in the first decade of the 15th century, following the pattern of the Diósgyõr fortress, with a row of arcades in its yard.
He had the fortress of Visegrád enlarged, too, with an outer wall and a decorative outside gate tower.
Sigismund's baron followed the King's example: Filippo Scolari had a Northern Italian-style castle built, which had a regular ground-plan (1416-1426), and János Maróti also had one in Gyula.
The huge castle of the Garais in Siklós had a rather irregular ground-plan, just like their castle in Csesznek, which was built on a mountain (1424).
Here - just like in the case of the constructions of voivode Stibor's mountain castle at Beckó - they did not the have the possibility to follow a regular ground-plan.
In this peaceful period a lot of weakly fortified, comfortable castles were built as well, for example, at Tar, Kisnána and Szászvár.
Buda
The enlargement of the Buda castle was started in the 1410s by Sigismund.
A new block was built including a multi-storey audience hall and an extended fortification system.
The King founded the St Sigismund provostship in front of the palace, near the town royal house, called Fresh Palace. The church of this provostship, completed between 1410 and 1424, was very similar to the Maria Magdalena parish church, which was rebuilt at that time.
The Church of Our Lady of Buda was rebuilt parallel to the constructions of the palace. It was enlarged with new side-chancels, splendid southern gates and the chapel of the Garai family.
The city itself gained its medieval shape then: several one or two-storey stone buildings were built here.
Pozsony
The constructions of Pozsony were carried out under Viennese influence in the first quarter of the century, examplified by the spire of the Franciscan church or the outer form of the town hall.
Because of the Hussite threat, Sigismund started to fortify the castle and the city in the 1420s.
In the 1430s the castle became an important residence of the ruler.
The constructions of Buda were stopped and the architectural workshop moved to the Pozsony castle with the lead of Master Conrad Erlingi.
The castle with a square ground-plan and a corner tower followed the pattern of the Diósgyõr fortress.
The beautiful gate tower of the outer wall is a close 'relative' of the Visegrád and Buda gate towers, which resembles the bridge tower of the old city of Prague.
The style of the castle building workshop defined the constructions in the city: the new wing of the town hall of Pozsony and the finish of the western part of the St Martin church of Pozsony, and also the details of several houses in the city.
East Hungary
The reconstructions of the St Elisabeth church of Kassa started at the beginning of the 15th century.
A five-nave, cross-house church was raised with three decorative gates.
The constructions, especially the style of the gates show the influence of the royal construction works at Buda and that of the Parler workshop in Prague.
The vault of the church was finished before 1440 by masters who studied in Vienna.
The building at Kassa created a special style, which spread all over the country in the 1420s.
The Franciscan church of Kassa was built under the influence of the parish church, but the style of Kassa was copied in Northern-East Hungary, in Transylvania on the nave of the St Michael church of Kolozsvár, the parish church of Brasso and the mountain church of Segesvár, in Krakow on the Augustine church of Kazimierzi.
The Western part of the country
The cathedral of Gyõr was totally rebuilt by Bishop John Hédervári (1386-1415) at the beginning of the 15th century.
He added a richly elaborated chapel to the southern side of the three-nave new building with twin towers on its western side.
The St James parish church of Kõszeg was reconstructed by the Garais into a three-nave church hall with a longitudinal chancel.
The St Mark church of Zagreb is similar to this, which was built at the turn of the century. Its 15th-century gates resembles that of the Garai chapel at Buda.
Eberhard, Bishop of Zagreb, started the building of the nave of the cathedral of Zagreb between 1410-1419, which was continued by his successor, John (1421-1433).
The other face of the architecture of Transdanubia, the style of the churches of small market towns, was represented by the parish church of Berhida.
The architecture of Upper-Hungary
The constructions of the new church hall of the abbacy and the monastery of Garamszentbenedek started at the end of the 14th century or at the beginning of the 15th century.
In Eperjes a similar, but rather irregular hall-like chancel was added to the parish church after 1391.
The parish churches of the market towns of the Szepesség (for example, Szepesbéla, Kakaslomnic) were vaulted with an arch standing on a central pillar or row of pillars, copying Czech and Polish models.
Such vaults were built on the parish churches of Körmöcbánya and Tar and probably the Franciscan church of Kassa as well.
From among monasteries which were the burial places of aristocratic families voivode Stibor's Augustine church of Vágújhely is a special one, as it follows Charles the Great's church of Prague (and indirectly the palace chapel of Aachen).
The Pauline churches of Kurithán (after 1419) and Gönc (1429) are traditional buildings.
Fine arts
Stone cutting
In stone cutting the soft style of the first decade of the 15th century is represented by the popular Pieta sculptures (Mary crying over the dead Christ). The most beautiful one survived from Nagyszeben.
The most significant sculpture ensemble of the second - third decades of the 15th century is the group of Gothic sculptures found in Buda in 1974.
The masters of these sculptures came from different regions of Europe and represented the most modern styles of the period.
The sculptures which were found in the St Sigismund church were made by them, just like the girl's head found in the royal palace.
There are findings from the Church of Our Lady of Buda as well, they originate from the beginning of the 15th century.
The most significant pieces of contemporary tomb-stone cutting are the figurative red marble Stibor tomb-stones.
Wood cutting and altars
The most important Hungarian wood cutting relic of the soft style was made in the 1410s, it was the altarpiece of Kislomnic.
The Magdolna sculpture of Dénesfalva and the St Dorothy sculpture of Barka represent a similarly graceful style.
The Miserable Christ of Fonyód shows common features with the sculpture findings from Buda.
The second Madonna of Toporc has the elements of late Gothic style.
The first painted altars survived from the beginning of the 15th century.
The Jeremy tabloid of Pónik and the triptychon built into the St Catherine altar of Lõcse and the Calvary altar of Garamszentbenedek painted by Thomas Kolozsvári in 1427 - which is the most significant relic of the Hungarian soft style - were all made under the influence of Czech painting.
The art of the neighbouring Austrian territories defined the style of the altar of Németújvár. Unfortunately only a cut picture of the spinning Mary survived from it.
Wall painting
The influence of Italian arts played an important role at the beginning of the 15th century, as shown by the fragments of the wall paintings of the parish church of Pest or the frescos of Rimabrezo.
Small churches in the countryside were decorated by the masters of wandering painting workshops, the style of which was strongly provinicialised.
The Highland example of the Central European soft style was the 1415 cycle of frescos of the parish church of Pónik.
The most important relic of this style was the 'Resurrection' picture of the St Elisabeth church of Kassa from the 1420s.
We can see the influence of Czech painting on the rich fresco decorations of the church in the Transylvanian Almakerék.
The representation of the St Ladislaus legend remained quite popular; a good example of this was the fresco from Székelyderzs from 1419.
Book painting
The Czech soft style strongly influenced the Hungarian book painting of the beginning of the 15th century.
Besides rich ornamentations, the 'D' missal of the Pozsony prepostery was decorated with soft figurative initials.
A Canon picture, representing the crucifixion of Christ, originates from another Pozsony missal.
The law book of Körmöcbánya was also richly decorated.
The 1423 missal of smith guild of Vác, decorated by illuminator John, is a beautiful relic. The starting initial of this is decorated with the picture of St Eligius, the patron saint of the smiths.
The beautiful breviary of George Pálóczy, the Archbishop of Esztergom (1423-1439), also survived.
During his travels, King Sigismund issued several decorative escutcheoned letters, and these were decorated by the available local painters.
Applied arts
The textile art of the Sigismund age is represented by many chasubles, which survived from the period.
A nicely cut saddle decorated with the emblem of the Dragon order proves that there was a developed court culture at King Sigismund's court.
An early memory of the typical Hungarian wired enamel technique was King St Ladislaus's herm (head relic holder).
The chalice of Torna is covered with cut decoration.
Several bronze baptising pools - which followed 14th-century traditions - were cast in the Highland and Transylvania.
Stove-making was also booming in the Sigismund age.
Various, colourful tile stoves were built not only in the royal court, but also in castles, mansions or city houses.
THE HISTORY OF MUSIC
The conditions of music life
After the age of the Árpád dynasty there were significant changes in Hungary both in political-economic life and the intellectual sphere and music also underwent a big change.
The process of desintegration of the country (the Tartar attack, inner anarchy) was stopped by Charles I's policy directed to Western Europe, so the 14th century brought about a real cultural prosperity.
Through the dynastic relations of the Angevine rulers the intellectual horizon was broadened towards the west.
With the boom in mining and trade new city centers were born (especially in Upper Hungary and Transylvania), and the economic prosperity provided new chances for music, too.
Though the network of cities was not as dense as in Western Europe, and could not result in the concentration of intellectuals, it still was the golden age of music in the late Middle Ages. Music life in the age shows a unified picture concerning music education and practice.
New data about music life
The number of relics of musical notation increased in that age. Charters and bills also prove that there was a permanent and intensive music life in churches and public life as well.
Besides the daily mass and vespera, schools provided the music service for the foundation and Mary masses, burial services and funerals. It meant at least 3-4 hours of singing in the church itself.
Certain movements are mentioned by the foundation masses: for example, the popular Salve Regina or from the newer, more modern pieces the Ave verum corpus.
As the majority of the foundations were in Upper Hungary, it is possible that their growing number reflects more comfortable and wealthy bourgeois life style.
Singing students could be heard outside the church, too: they participated in processions or pompous celebrations (greetings, elections). Besides the Gregorian movements they performed polyphonic pieces and chants as well.
Their greeting activity (greeting songs) - which were performed by simple clergymen or peasants - survived till today as a folk tradition (New Year's greeting song, name-day greeting songs). Thanks to this tradition the melodies of medieval greeting songs could survive.
Joculators and instrumental musicians
While the word joculator referred to both the singers of heroic legends and the entertaining singers in the past, its real meaning gradually shifted towards the second meaning.
The most popular group of instrumental musicians was that of the trumpet players (together with the drummers), who became the sounding symbols of lords and royal power. (For example, they accompanied Sigismund on his visit to France, or hunts.)
In cities they were employed at festivals or as tower guards.
Organs were used in Hungarian churches from the 14th century (organists were usually organ builders as well).
Franciscan, Dominican and Paulian monks were very good at playing this instrument.
Parallel with the enrichment of the cities there is more and more data about the use of organs since the 15th century.
At this time organs were not used to accompany singing, but instead to decorate the melody or according to the so-called alternative use, singing and instrumental music altered from verse to verse.
There were many names for instrumental players from the 14th century - such as drummer, whistler, fiddler, bugler, luter, fluter - but these were job-names and not family names.
The different layers of musicians were the following: village musicians, musicians employed in the city, musicians employed by landlords or prelates (or maybe by the King), wandering musicians.
Memories of musical notation did not survive, but in the light of secondary data "we can talk about a network of musicians, which ensnared the whole country".
Music at the royal court
The royal court was one of the most significant centres of artistic music. Its golden age was the age of King Matthias, reaching the level of Western-European capellas.
The first step towards this was taken by the Angevine dynasty. By Sigismund's age the role of court music became very important.
Sigismund, who had the Buda palace rebuilt and the royal chapel reorganised, thought it was important that he would be accompanied on his travels by the famous minnesänger, Oscar von Wolkenstein. They were almost friends.
On his diplomatic travels he took his capella with himself - just as at the synod of Constanz - as a musical symbol of his power.
The capella had its own school, organ player and wind instrument players, so they could perform polyphonic music. However, their main task was to perform Gregorian songs during services.
The situation of Gregorian music in the late Middle Ages
Gregorian music kept its ruling position in the late Middle Ages as well. It was still taught in schools, and its theoretical and practical knowledge was essential to elementary education.
In certain genres there was a compositional growth: in the mass there were new movements besides the alleluyas and sequences. These were the ordinarium movements and the nicer reading tones.
With the increase of the number of the saints new song cycles appeared in the office through adoption (import), and it satisfied the local spiritual needs.
The notes of liturgic books also refer to this fact at the appropriate saints: "Own office - if you have it in your book".
Books and musical notation
About 30 unbroken codices and hundreds of fragments survived from the 14-15th centuries, referring to a rich literacy.
The majority of manuscripts were small-size and made by simple hands, but they were useful manuals containing real musical notes, which were followed by large decorative codices in the next age.
The golden age of Hungarian musical note writing was the 14th century. It is proved by the Missal notatum (service book with musical notes) of Esztergom, which is kept in Pozsony.
Its notation, liturgic order and the totality of melody variants makes this book the most reliable manuscript of central Hungarian traditions.
Besides Hungarian notation, a modern notation appeared in the 14th century on the borderline, which was developed from a Lotharingian notation type. It was strongly partitioned, 'Gothisised' writing built from big-size elements. It was called the "Metzigothic musical notation."
For example, the Graduale of Upper Hungary was written with this kind of notation, and we can find it in the codices of Pozsony from the 14th century, and in some manuscripts from Kassa, Kolozsvár and Brasso.
On north-western territories the Czech musical notation was used - the influence of this can be seen, for example, on the notation of the second Antiphony of Esztergom. Besides the centers that kept the Esztergom traditions, Hungarian music writing was preserved by the Pauline order, who tried to develop it into a big-size codex-writing later.
The influence of Metzigothic notation on Hungarian music writing could be already felt in the 14th century, and this influence became even stronger in the 15th century.
The change of music writing reflects a kind of inner view, according to which attention was drawn to the notes themselves, and the connection between the groups of notes (neuma) became looser.
The direction of writing also changed: instead of the rows of points of clear Hungarian notation, which went downwards, this writing went from left to right, in accordance with order they followed one another in time.
This mixed notation is considered a Hungarian innovation; it includes the punctual, clear Metzigothic notation and the flexibile and drawing-like Hungarian notation.
It was used from the first third of the 15th century till the middle of the 16th century, first of all in decorated big choir books.
Its significance is shown by the fact that this musical notation was used in the major Hungarian codices (for example, the first Antiphony of Esztergom and the Graduale of Futak).
Franciscan and Dominican service books from the turn of the 14-15th centuries differ from the above mentioned Hungarian liturgical-musical traditions in their content and musical notation. Their quadrate musical notation (square note forms) and melody variants follow the foreign models of their centralised orders and not the local tradition.
In contrast to these, the four 15th-century antiphonies of Pozsony were written with the Metzigothic notation, but they followed the Esztergom traditions, which was considered the main line of medieval Hungarian music writing.
Medieval polyphony
In contrast to the great number of Gregorian codices, there are only a few polyphonic memories.
Several 14th-century fragments and the statue of the Pauline order - which banned polyphony - proves the living practice of polyphony.
A source from the Upper Hungary, which originates from the beginning of the 15th century, includes several movements. It is called a 'fragment from the Sigismund age'.
14-15th-century sources contain out-of-fashion European musical styles, which were very popular a few hundred years before.
Some of these techniques were known in the West already at the turn of the millennium.
It was a special, solemn performance, for example, if the solistic parts of a Gregorian chant were dressed in a richer melody (first by improvisation).
The basic principle of melodies for two or three voices, which were built on fourths and fifths, are the parallel and opposite movements of the melody.
Besides celebrational readings, popular tropes or - as in a Franciscan codex - the alleluya movement of the mass could also be decorated like this.
If a rhythmic opposite melody was composed to a non-liturgic, but free melody, it resulted in a more modern tone, even if the usage of sound intervals followed the old traditions (based on fourths, fifths or octaves).
Such rhythmic polyphonic chants were not considered liturgic music in a narrow sense, but they enriched the musical art of clerical intellectuals.
However, the addition of rhythmic opposite melodies to Gregorian melodies fitted the liturgy and it was nearly as good as the compositional, 'scientific' style of the age.
Folk songs in the mother tongue
The first recorded Hungarian folk song was the most popular Easter song in Europe: "Christ resurrected from his great pain".
This can be read on the side of the pages of the Fragment from the Sigismund age in four languages: in Hungarian, Czech, German and Polish.
(It was probably sung in the mother tongue at Easter.)
This movement was originally added to the Victimae pashali sequence, or it was sung by the audience at the end of the night office, after the resurrection play (Easter play).
Another early Hungarian folk song was the Hungarian Te Deum, though it was first recorded in the Peer codex around 1500, but this refers to the spread of this song. Presumably it was sung already in the 15th century.
Besides the Easter song and the Te Deum, we can mention the Christmas song Shepherds [Csordapásztorok], which was the greeting song (telling about the forthcoming feast) of medieval students (in the text we can find references to King Sigismund's "fresh palace").
Possibly the Easter song Christ resurrected on that day was also sung in that period, since its Latin text was also written on the pages of the Fragments from the Sigismund age.
The following centuries are much richer in folk songs sung in the mother tongue.
Medieval epic songs
Memories of musical notation did not survive about epic songs.
The St Ladislaus song is known from a 16th-century source, the Peer codex, though the roots of its melody go back to the Middle Ages.
The dirges of Hungarian folk music underwent a development (verses connected to the text of funeral songs, prayers, ballads and miserable songs), which might have preserved a certain public epic style, whose later variants were the 16-17th-century historical songs.
The medieval layers of Hungarian folk music
The rich customary culture, which was booming in the Middle Ages - a significant part of which became folk traditions by today - preserved many melodies.
Some of them were organised into a real cycle, such as the melodies of Midsummer Night from the region of Zobor.
The oldish songs of this certainly originate from the Middle Ages.
Archaic customary melodies had some common features with Gregorian songs, as a result of the similar way of musical thinking, and not because they influenced each other.
The ceremonious major hexachord melodies accompanying children's games (bridge, procession or pair games) might also originate from the Middle Ages, just like the music of the dramatic plays of cultic men's companies, the one-time guilds.
The memory of medieval greeting song was preserved by the chants of young men or children. The basic layer of Gregory procession is also of medieval origin.
The elements of the acoustics of medieval village-towns were the cries of night guards such as the recitative verse learning at school. The traces of this latter one were preserved by the rhymes of Transylvanian Nativity plays and the Advent host carrying.
According to Lajos Vargyas the oldest group of Hungarian ballads originates from 14th-century folk poetry.
As he had found only French parallels to these, he thought this influence might have come from that direction, through the Vallon settlers.
There is closer European relation to Hungarian shepherd songs.
The Western-European counterparts of the rhythm of shepherd songs is the vagant lines, so shepherd songs preserved the musical material of the songs of medieval entertainers, joculators.
Similarly the Bethlehem shepherd dance or the dance motifs of Whitsun dances may have preserved medieval dance music.
Data prove that the ancient dirges survived in the Middle Ages, too (for example, Charles I's mourning songs).
The melodies of those dirges may have been the same that we know today.
Ambitus melodies became popular at this time and a great number of stanzic folk songs might have separated from dirges during this period, too.
THE HISTORY OF DANCE
Introduction
The 150 years between 1300 and 1400 saw a boom in the ecclesiastic arts, the development of court arts and city culture.
In Hungary this development was very specific - typical of Eastern Europe - and was connected to the royal court because the development of towns was late there were few aristocratic courts suitable for promoting court culture.
During the reign of the three significant rulers - Charles I, Louis the Great and especially Sigismund - the Hungarian royal court became an important political and cultural centre, and this enabled the country to adopt the most beautiful forms of European arts.
If we want to form an opinion about the whole of contemporary culture, we have to consider the elements of local culture - which are rarely mentioned by the sources. It is especially true for dance culture, which has only a few sources, in contrast to music, literature and fine arts.
The written sources of dance culture
Relics of linguistic history play an important role among references to the dance culture of the age.
With the increase in the number of sources in the Hungarian language there are more and more common Hungarian, or international words with reference to dance.
The word 'dance' appears first in the language in 1350 as an international loan word, which probably meant pair dances accompanied by instrumental music - according to the contemporary European usage of the word.
The Schlägl list of words is from 1405, which matches the word 'tombás' [entertainer] with three Latin expressions: cantatrix, gestulator, palpanist.
This does not mean that the composer of this list of words was inaccurate, but it refers to the various activities of the 'tombás' (entertainer, minstrel, puppet player).
The act of dancing is expressed with the word 'tombol, tomb' [entertain, entertainment] in many sources, probably with the meaning jumping dance.
Heavenly and earthly love
The special feature of the development of 14-15th-century European culture is that court arts became more and more independent in contrast to ecclesiastic arts.
In the field of dance this process took place besides the ban of dance practice - which was declared profane - and the spread of idealised dance symbols (King David's dance, Salome's dance).
With some exceptions, dance was not part of church services any more, so it did not have advantages that religious songs and poetry had in contemporary schools.
No one was engaged in making dance an independent art, creating its literacy, or including its artistic forms into the canon.
Dance, however, could stand its ground under such circumstances, too as the basic form of expression of European culture. As an important part of court culture and way of life it was booming.
The code of behaviour and movements, which defined European dance culture and social life, was gradually developing.
Its cradle was the 12th-century Provence, its midwife was the 14th-century Italy, its master was the 15th-century Burgundy, and it spread throughout Europe.
We can feel the ancient Greek and Latin culture in its origins, and later the influence of Syrian, Old Hebrew, Arabic and other Oriental cultures is also significant.
Experiences obtained during the crusades also helped its development.
In medieval Europe the most important virtues were polite and complacent behaviour, abstinent love, skillfulness, self-control, good taste and reliability besides the admiration of women and loyal service to the liege lord.
In dance, these virtues were embodied by solemn and firm posture, and circle dances performed with reserved movements and chaste, abstinent behaviour.
The most beautiful part of knightly service was love, entertaining and courting (Amor, Joi, Cortesia). All these were for the sake of the lady of the castle.
Each knight had his chosen lady, whom he escorted and served. This lady reigned over the knight's heart.
The scene of the service, the garden of love (cour d'amour) was the castle, suitable for social life, where the knights could practise polite behaviour through court dances and songs in the company of the lady and her maids of honour.
The typical figures of the garden of love were the troubadurs, the talented cultivators of music, singing and dancing. They often amused their audience with dance performances (laudas, ballads), masks, satirical songs, rebuking songs and romances.
Luxurious courts, similar to western courts, and the possibility of court life developed in Hungary, too, during the reign of the Angevine kings and especially Sigismund. Its scenes were royal residences: Esztergom, Visegrád, Buda and Diósgyõr.
There were plenty of family happenings, coronations, peace-makings, receptions of ministers and diplomatic meetings, which provided opportunity for pompous feasts, tournaments and dances.
Unfortunately there are no descriptions, official or private letters about these, and contemporary account books do not mention dances either.
We must mention the representations in the frescos of Runkelstein because of their references to the Hungarians, where Louis the Great's mother, Queen Elisabeth, dances a marching dance with the Bavarian Prince, Melchior and the members of his court.
This dance could be the local variant of the popular marching dance - which used slow steps - (Tanz, Hofetanc, Basse danse), usually followed by a quicker leaping dance combined with pantomime-like elements, in concert with the tradition of the age.
Similar dances might have been danced at the celebration following the coronation of King Sigismund in 1387, and at the great meeting of European knights at Buda in 1396.
Several contemporary sources mention the ruler's affection for dance.
According to one of them, in 1411 the king wanted to court the favour of a bourgeois girl with dance against Prince Frederick in Innsbruck.
Another source mentions that even at the age of 66, he was an enthusiastic dancer at a burgher feast in Augsburg.
In 1432, when he was crowned emperor, there were pompous celebrations in Rome, and the Hungarian members of his escort tried to make these memorable in various ways.
Besides these, several other sources prove that the clothing, musical instruments and way of dancing of the Hungarians - as they were different - attracted the attention of the other peoples.
It is known that János Hunyady, when he was in Italy with King Sigismund in 1433-1434, was the focus of attention because of the way he danced.
All the dignitary ladies wanted to dance with him, even the king himself became envious.
The Aachen pilgrimages of the Hungarians had similar effects on the foreigners, where they became famous for their spectacular marches, bear-leading and street dances.
Beginning from the 14th century in Western Europe the scene of secular dance life expanded from royal courts to the cities, where the burghers danced their own dances and dances learnt at courts at reserved dancing places - which were maintained at public expense - under the strict control of the aldermen.
This is proved by the representations of brides' chests from Florence from the early 15th century. In these, the rich citizens dance a marching dance accompanied by instrumental music.
A similar scene can be seen on the wall-painting of a contemporary house in the Buda castle, where the dancers are followed by a jester wearing a jester's cap.
Profane dances
In Dante's Comedy (La Commedia) the heavenly Estates of the Realm, the armies of the saved dance the elegant ruota and gira dances in Paradise, while the damned danced ridda and tresca - that is peasant dances - in Hell.
This idea shows the philosophy of the age concerning the various new and traditional dances.
(This evaluation may have been known in Hungary, too, since Dante's work could be found in Louis the Great's library.
The Latin translation of the Comedy was directly dedicated to King Sigismund by the translator.)
In spite of the underestimation and frequent bans, peasant dances survived in Hungary, mixed with the newly acquired European traditions.
By the 15th century the tradition of carnivals, Whitsun, lighting fires on Midsummer Night and chanting at Christmas were spread in Hungary, too.
Besides the new forms of traditions in connection with family celebrations and working these were the main occasions for dancing.
A source from 1499 from Pelbart's preaching from Temesvár - though it might refer to an earlier practice - mentioned the case of women participating in the mask carnival near the river Kapos, one of whom was captured from the dance by a demon - as a punishment.
It seems that there were no independent, entertaining occasions for dance in contemporary peasant communities similar to court and city celebrations, which were very popular.
The system of genres did not develop in traditional dance during the Middle Ages, which is so typical of today's folk dances.
According to the sources there were only two genres: joint chain-circle dances accompanied with singing, which were based on slow steps (there could be different forms for women, men and mixed companies); and dances based on leaping-stamping-throbbing movements, which appeared in various forms (solo, paired, group, men's, women's dances, performed with instruments or without those, in masks or without masks).
These developing genres were stuck together by different rhythmical, formal and functional frames.
CHURCH HISTORY
CONNECTION WITH THE HOLY SEE
Weakening papacy in a strong kingdom
The Papacy prospered in the 13th century, but it was a period of slow disintegration for the Hungarian royal power, especially during the second half of the century.
After 1301 Hungary was a state without a centralised power, it was a country divided and destroyed by the barons. The idea of kingdom was represented by the strict institutions and disciplines of the Catholic church and the material reality of the Holy Crown, originating from the state-founder St Stephen.
The central power was re-established by Charles I's 'uniting' policy.
He left a well-organised country - which was considered a great power in the region in respect of its foreign policy - to his son, Louis the Great.
However, the "Avignon exile" - following the model of the Babylon exile of the Jews - is an apt remark for the reign of the Papacy between 1305 and 1377.
The Popes lost their political strength under the guardianship of the French kings.
Accession to the Hungarian throne and the legates
According to the philosophy of the Holy See, Hungary owes a debt of Christian obedience to them and also belongs under their authority.
However, under the reign of Andrew III the members of the bishopric board and the majority of the barons believed that the country was independent of the papacy in worldly respect.
They considered Hungary as the Virgin Mary's legacy (that is, not of St Peter's) and the defence of the sovereignty of the country was more important than obedience to the Pope.
In their opinion an elected candidate should have mounted the vacant throne, but the Pope tried to force the Hungarian to accept his candidate, Charles Anjou - as the legal successor of the Árpád dynasty.
He sent his legates, Boccasini, then Bishop Gentilis to Hungary to convince the bishops that they should elect Charles as king.
Charles I and the church
After stabilising his power, Charles - who was helped to the throne by the papacy - soon had to face the opposition of the Hungarian prelates.
They were dissatisfied with their new king, because they thought he was ruling in an absolutist way, without convoking a diet, after defeating the governors of provinces he kept the church estates - which were previously taken by the governors - for himself, and he appointed secular persons to vacant prelate positions.
Prelates had to set up their banderys, and ecclesiastic persons were often summoned to secular law courts.
The king appointed his own men as bishops, if needed by ignoring the canonic election of chapters.
The letter the bishops sent to the Pope in their despair in 1338 contained these and some similar accusations.
The Papal warning had no result, the ruler did not change his church policy at all.
Charles tried hard to assert the interests of the country, even when he had to oppose the papal power that helped him to the throne: he used his advowee's right, which he inherited from the Árpáds.
He even laid tax on the so-called papal tithe, which was collected between 1332 and 1337.
Foreign tax collectors could start their work after the Pope had offered one third of the tax to the benefit of the king.
However, Charles's measures taken for the good of the monasteries are very significant.
He reconfirmed the old privileges of the monasteries, and the political influence of the monastic orders (especially that of the begging orders) had increased during his reign.
He appointed several monks as bishops.
King Louis the Great, the champion of the church
From among the wars only his unsuccessful fight for the throne of Naples was against the interests of Avignon.
Their following campaigns "in every directions" (for example, against the Greek Catholic Serbs, the heretic Bosnians and pagan Lithuanians and Tartars) are in close connection with the political and converting ambitions of the Holy See.
Louis the Great often provided military help in the inner fight of Ecclesiastic State of the Popes. Hungarian troops protected the Pope on his return from Avignon to Rome.
In 1356 a letter from the Pope called him "Christ's shield, the Lord's athlete".
In the meantime Louis the Great continued his father's policy in banning the collection of papal tithe and asserting royal interest in filling church positions.
During the fight for the throne of Naples there was an intensive exchange of ministers between the Papal and the Hungarian court.
After this period Papal legates visited Hungary only on very important occasions.
Their duties included converting in the East, settling the Balkan situation, mediating in peace treaties.
Bishop Guido's legation in 1349 was a very important one.
The Popes recognised the Turkish danger early and in this matter Pope Orban V sent his minister to Buda.
In 1371 a papal legate came to Hungary to settle the dispute between King Louis and Emperor Charles IV. At the same time Hungarian legates spent months in Avignon, where - besides settling public matters - they forwarded the requests of their relatives or familiares to the Pope in the form of so-called papal requests (supplicatio).
Hungary and the Western split of the church
After the death of Pope Gregory XI - who moved back to Rome - in 1378 the different groups of cardinals chose two popes, one of whom went back to Avignon.
Hungary was one of those countries which accepted and supported the "legal" Roman pope.
This fact exceeded the level of diplomatic politeness, because at that time the Pope's power was quite significant concerning the governing of the church in Hungary.
By this time the tradition, that the popes reserved their rights to fill up vacancies in Hungarian church positions (reservatio), was widely accepted in the country.
So the foreign, so-called edict-people fulfilled not only bishopric duties, but also the positions of main deans, canons and other benefices. Hungarian intellectual middle layers also wanted these positions for themselves.
At first King Sigismund and Pope Bonifac IX solved this problem with compromises.
King Sigismund's church governing
The good relationship between the Pope and the Hungarian king lasted till 1403.
Then Pope Bonifac IX together with some of the Hungarian prelates and aristocrats supported the anti-king, Ladislaus of Naples, against Sigismund. He even sent a legate to help him.
After Sigismund had defeated him, he had the estates of the rebelling prelates seized and removed some of the leading prelates from their positions. He appointed secular governors to the lead of church districts.
The king gave up his obedience to Pope Bonifac IX, but did not accept the anti-pope, Benedict XIII either.
He tried to keep away the church matters of the country from the authority of the Holy See and intended to solve them himself.
For the sake of the cause he issued a decree on 6 April 1404, which contained the so-called royal discretional right.
This situation lasted till 1410, when Sigismund entered into diplomatic relationship with Pope John XXIII, who was elected by the reform synod of Pisa.
Sigismund - as German king and the presumptive of the emperor's throne, convoked the synod of Constanz in 1414, the most significant congress of the late Middle Ages, where he was chairman.
Its most important aims were to put an end to the split of the western church, which divided the continent since 1378, elect a new pope, accepted by everyone, and reform the secularising church.
After long diplomatic negotiations, Sigismund's activity was partly successful, as two popes were willing to retire, and he deprived the third one of his supporters.
The cause of the reform failed, but before the new pope, Martin V, was elected Sigismund forced the cardinals to issue a charter, the so-called "Constanz bull".
Later Hungarian kings referred to this document when they wanted to assert their advowee's right.
After the synod Sigismund's relation with the papacy was well-balanced, in spite of the fact that Pope Martin V asserted his and his successors' right to be in command of church possessions right at the beginning of his reign.
In practice, however, the king's role became more significant, as for vacant positions the Pope usually appointed the person who was previously recommended by the king.
Sigismund's other important decision was that he restricted the appeals of church persons to Rome - it was important for the Hungarian clergy because of the costs of the lawsuits - and the power of ecclesiastic courts (so-called holy chairs) for the advantage of secular courts.
CHURCH SOCIETY
Prelates
The prelates, who were the heads of church society, left the governing of their church districts to their vicars, because the major part of their duties included performing political activities.
Officially archbishops and bishops were members of the royal council, chancellors - leading the written administration of the government - were recruited from among them, though there were some secular secret chancellors as well, during King Sigismund's reign.
As they could write and speak languages, they often were in charge of diplomatic duties.
In time of war it was also their duty to banderies under their own banner.
At that time they usually came from one of the aristocratic families.
The provost of Székesfehérvár and the Johannite prior of Vrána also belonged to the uppermost layer of the clergy.
The middle layer
If a prelate died or was removed from his office, the appointment of the new bishops was a long procession, and three major factors played an important role in it.
The right of the residence chapters to elect bishops - which was widely practised in the 13th century - was pushed back now for the advantage of the two other factors. The Pope usually appointed the bishop after the king had presented the person to him (praesentatio).
From the 14th century the middle layer of the church, the canons, did not perform their liturgic duties themselves, but they left those to their substitutes, called prebendaries - they were named after their regular income, the prebenda.Concerning the financial situation of these prebendaries, they belonged to the lower level of church people.
The regular income of canons - there were 600 stallums for canons in 50 residence and communal chapters - enabled them to constitute a significant part of medieval Hungarian intellectuals.
In church hierarchy the church district of bishops was divided into dean districts, which were usually the same as castle districts.
They were directed by the archdeacons, who moved into the residence chapters and were members of the board of canons. These archdeacons practised their rights to control parish priest, who belonged under their juristic authority, in the form of church visits (visitatio).
Their annual visits were quite expensive for the village priests, so the size of revenue was strictly regulated by law.
At the beginning of the 14th century parish priests were the priest of royal towns, or market towns, who were removed from the juristic authority of the archdeacons or sometimes even the bishop. These priests could keep the whole of the collected tithe.
These distinguished church positions and the due income were sometimes received by persons who had nothing to do with the church.
That is how Charles I's court doctor received the parish of Patak.
In the majority of the cases, however, parish priests were elected by the people of cities and market towns. Royal appointments were quite exceptional.
The lower layer of priests
By the end of the 14th century priests of smaller religious communities, who did not have the above mentioned privileges, were also called parish priests (earlier they were called chaplains).
In concert with the system of advowees, inherited from a previous period of time, they were employed by landlords for a definite time and definite salary.
Their task was to deliver sacraments, to celebrate masses and to preach.
Most of them received their basic theological and practical skills at the chapter school.
From the tithe their legal due was the one sixteenth part.
Chaplains, appointed and supported by parish priests, belonged to the lower layer of church society.
Besides them, altar- and chapel masters - who were paid from the mass foundations - prayed for the salvation of the donators.
There were poor altar masters in bishopric cathedrals as well, they belonged to the choir.
The transformation of monastic orders
By the 14th century monastic orders had lost their important positions.
The number of their monasteries decreased, there were fewer monks in the cloisters and the disciplines also slackened.
The reason for the slow but continuous decline was the fact that they could not meet the new demands of the society, where religion had also undergone a great change. The believers demanded a more active spiritual care, preaching and looking after the poor.
There was another reason as well: medieval popes and kings - in the lack of financial means for this purpose - paid their dependants who performed church governing and diplomatic duties by giving away richer abbacies.
Such abbots were usually secular persons, called commendators/gubernators, or members of a different order. They did not live in the monastery of their abbacy and they did not deal with the interests and discipline of the monks either.
Ulaslo, Polish prince, was such a gubernator in Pannonhalma in 1376.
Monastic and canon orders and orders of knighthood
The number of abbacies of the Benedictine order, which owned 81 monasteries originally, was only 64 by 1400.
During the 15th century 27 of them fell into the hands of commendators.
For the advantage of an inner renewal, there were reform movements, which ordered the convening of the annual national monastic meetings, the so-called chapters.
The Cistercias had only one quarter of their monasteries, and the head of the order was warned by King Louis the Great to stop the misuse of authority.
The Premontreans, who had 33 monasteries, had managed to keep their importance and popularity, partly because they functioned as credible places, too.
The community of monks of a certain monastic orders was called the convent.
Orders of knighthood had only a few monasteries.
After the dissolution of the order of the knights of the Temple in 1312 their possessions were given to the Johannites, just like the prior district of Vrána.
King Sigismund also tried to settle the German order of Knighthood in Transylvania, but he was unsuccessful.
The decline of the Stephanite order - which was founded in Hungary - started in the 14th century and they stopped functioning by the middle of the 15th century.
Hermit orders
Hermit orders were highly appreciated by society at that time.
The "mute brothers" (Karthaus hermits), who were famous for their strict disciplines, had 4 monasteries.
The other monastic order, which was founded in Hungary, the Pauline order was prospering in the 14-15th centuries. It received St Augustine's regulations from the legate of Gentilis in 1308.
In 1327 they had 30 monasteries, by the age of Sigismund this number had doubled.
In 1367, at Louis the Great's request the order was accepted by the Pope, which enabled them to be independent of the bishop.
Louis the Great obtained Hermit St Paul's earthly remains from Venice in 1381, and the relics were placed into the centre of the Pauline order, at Budaszentlõrinc.
In 1418 they received a permission from the Pope to preach.
At the lead of the monasteries was the prior, who was appointed by the head of the Hungarian order at the annual chapter meeting at Budaszentlõrinc.
Begging orders
In contrast with the Paulines, who escaped from the noisy world, the begging orders lived in busy regions.
At the beginning of the 14th century, the members of the Augustine order, who had about 25 monasteries, were called hermits, but in fact it was a begging order.
The Carmelites managed to settle down at Buda in 1372, but they were not very popular: they had 4 monasteries altogether.
Not so the Dominicans, who had at least 40 cloisters, mainly in towns.
Besides preaching, they were engaged in studying.
The Franciscans were even more successful. In 1316 the Hungarian Franciscan province was divided into eight custodies with 43 monasteries, and this number raised to 50 by 1379.
Charles I appointed Franciscan monks at the lead of bishoprics, and his ministers were often chosen from among the Franciscans.
Begging orders played an important role: they were missionaries on the Balkans.
CHURCH AND SOCIETY
The everyday life of Christians
The everyday life of people was restricted by the church.
The rhythm of the change of time was defined by the proportional division of weekdays spent working and the Sundays and holidays of the church year.
Church holidays were often the days when the villeins of the villages had to present their different products or services to the landlords.
Holidays in the calendar were connected to the cult of saints.
The day of the patron saint of a certain church community was also celebrated.
The popularity of the saints of the Árpád dynasty ("saint kings"), especially of King St Ladislaus, was encouraged by the Angevine kings and Sigismund, who was buried at Várad near St Ladislaus's tomb.
Pagans, heretics
The liturgic ceremonies performed by priests were in Latin, but the vulgar linguistic vocabulary of the church must have been used very early, which was connected to the preaching of the mass, and the confession of sins.
There were non-Christian, or non-Catholic ethnic groups in the territory of Hungary.
Tendencies to convert these pagan, heretic people were important in the second half of the 14th century, since King Louis considered this his first and most important duty.
He also tried to convert the Jews, but after his failure around 1360, he expelled them from the country. Although he withdrew his order in 1364, the majority of the those who escaped never returned.
The closed communities of Jewish settlers coming from the West - who lived in bigger cities - could keep their religious independence, though at the beginning of the 15th century there were anti-Jewish rebels.
The converting and assimilation of the Cumans was not an easy process, even after the 1279 laws. They were addicted to their pagan lifestyle and ancient traditions.
The Jaszes, who followed the Byzantine rite, received their privileges in return to their military services, but converting them to the Catholic religion - with the mediation of begging orders - was a very long procedure, which was finished in the second half of the 15th century.
They refused to pay the tithe, which is why their conversion lasted so long.
In the 14th century the settlement of the borderline with Greek Catholic ethnic groups was continued.
The Ruthenians, who settled down in the North-East, and the Rumanians, who settled down in Transylvania (they were around 150.000), were converted with the help of Franciscans.
After uniting the Orthodox people with the Catholic church in 1366, only those could become noble who adopted Catholicism.
When the union came to an end in 1386, Sigismund tried to continue Louis's policy in 1428.
In contrast to this the number of Orthodox churches and monasteries gradually increased.
Part of the settled Rumanian kenéz-s became Catholic, and not under pressure but rather for reasons of prestige, as the difference of religion was a burden for marriages to Hungarian noble families.
The Greek Catholic Serbs - who escaped from the Turks from the end of the 14th century and settled down in the Szerémség and Keve county - were also considered heretics by the Catholic church.
However, the royal power and the landlords provided the possibility of the freedom of religion to them, too - first of all because of economic interests.
The growth of the church
The Hungarian church reached its biggest size during the reign of the Angevine kings.
Royal policy, which wanted to establish its vassal states along the eastern and southern borders, met the converting activities of the Catholic church, which were performed by Franciscan monks.
The leaders of missionary bishoprics were often recruited from among the members of begging orders.
Charles I renewed the missionary bishopric of Nándorfehérvár in 1322, which was founded at the end of the 13th century, but Louis I's attempt to reorganise the one at Milko in 1354 failed.
The oldest Hungarian missionary bishopric was founded by Louis I in 1365 in Bodony (Vidin, Bulgaria), which had a very short life, similarly to the bishopric of Argyas, founded in 1382 (they were closed in 1386).
The bishopric of Szeret, which was founded in 1371 (it functioned till the end of the 15th century) to convert the Rumanians beyond the Carpathians, belonged directly under the authority of the Holy See, so it did not belong to the Hungarian church organisation.
The Dalmatian and Croatian prelates were mentioned in royal charters and were highly respected, though they did not belong to the Hungarian church either.
Heretics
The fight against heretics in the 14th century was against the Flagellants and Valdens, and the Pataren trends in Bosnia. The latter one was the aim of King Louis's southern campaigns many times.
From the 15th century the southern heretics got into contact with Hussitism, which spread from the Highland.
Sigismund started a crusade against the Czech Hussites from 1420, who in return launched destructive campaigns against Hungary after 1428.
Finally at the reform synod of Basel the king managed to make an agreement with the Chalice branch, and together they destroyed their camps in 1434.
The spread of Hussite teachings played an important role in the preparations of the 1437 peasants' revolt in Transylvania.
Thoma of Kamanc and clerk Valentine, the translators of the Hussite Bible (fragment) escaped from the activity of the Franciscan Jacob of Marchia, whose power extended over some southern and eastern church districts. Finally they found shelter in Moldavia.
Education, schools, universities
The church played an important role in spreading culture.
Monastic and chapter (cathedral) schools were first of all the institution for providing priests, but besides the seven free arts some of them taught law as well (to save the laws of the country) and prepared students for a secular career (chancelleries, credible places).
The Buda college of the Dominicans (studium generale) functioned continuously from the beginning of the 14th century in the Middle Ages, though it never became a real university.
The first Hungarian university was founded by Louis the Great at Pécs in 1367. Pope Orban V gave his permission to this school with the exception of the faculty of theology.
Unfortunately the university was closed at the end of the 14th century.
The Óbuda university, founded by Sigismund in 1395, had an even shorter life, but it was reorganised by the king, with the help of the papal legate, Branda Castiglione in 1410 because of the Hussite danger.
The representatives of the school took part in the synod of Constanz, but the institution was not mentioned by sources in the 1420s.
So Hungarian students had to go to foreign universities, such as the university of Vienna or Krakow.
Besides going to universities abroad, pilgrimages provided a possibility to travel for a much wider audience since the 14th century.
The most popular place of pilgrimage of the Hungarians was Aachen in Germany, since Louis the Great founded a chapel here in 1367, where the relics of the saint kings were placed (Stephen, Emeric and Ladislaus).
Apart from this place, Hungarian pilgrims travelled to Jerusalem, Rome and Compostella.
HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY
NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AND PROVINCES
Compared to the age of the Árpád dynasty the borders of Hungary did not change, but not so the neighbouring countries.
The Polish Kingdom lay to the north; it was ruled by the Piasts till 1370, the Angevine kings between 1370-1386, and the Jagellos from 1386.
The ruling family of Halics-Volhinia died out in 1340, after some decades the western part of Halics and Volhinia fell under Polish influence.
During the reign of Louis the Great as the king of Poland this region was governed by the Hungarians for a decade, under the title of the voivode of Russia. From 1837 it became part of Poland forever, under the name of Small Russia.
This territory lost its significance for Hungarian foreign policy. With Charles I's first marriage to Maria from Halics the century-old Russian-Hungarian dynastic relations came to an end.
In the north-east Hungary was bordered by the territory of the Golden Horde. During the reign of Charles I there were several Tartar attacks against the country.
By the middle of the century the Golden Horde retreated to the region behind the river Dnester, the territory without owner - the "Moldavian land" - fell under Hungarian supremacy, it was governed by the Rumanian voivodes of Máramaros: Drag, then his son, Szász.
Another voivode of Máramaros, Bogdán, took over the region around 1359 and organised the principality of Moldavia.
This country, which later became the vassal of Hungary, surrendered to Poland at the same time as Halics, though they sometimes acknowledged Hungarian supremacy as well.
The other Rumanian state, Wallachia [Havasalföld], became an independent principality around 1330, after Charles's unsuccessful campaign.
Its territory consisted of Oltenia (district of Szörénység) and Muntenia, beyond the river Olt.
Their voivodes, if they surrendered to the Hungarian king, bore the title of "the ban of Szörény" and they had power over the Fogarasföld, too. From 1394 they hesitated between being a vassal of the Turks or the Hungarians.
Voivode Mircea cel Batrin (1386-1428) led a policy in favour of the Hungarians, but after his death King Sigismund put the castle of Szörény under Hungarian supremacy.
The defence of the fortresses of Szörény was taken up by the German Order of Knighthood in 1429, but they were defeated by the Turks, so in 1435 royal troops occupied their fortresses again.
At the lower reach of the Danube Bulgaria was the neighbouring country.
In the middle of the 14th century Bulgaria was divided into two parts. The part which was closer to Hungary belonged to the Bulgarian tsar of Vidin (Bodony).
Louis the Great occupied this state in 1365, and till 1369 it was directed by a Hungarian governor, under the title of the ban of Bulgaria. Similarly to other bans, this ban also had power over Hungarian territories.
After the battle of Nicapole (1396) Vidin was occupied by the Turks.
The ban district of Macsó lay outside the Borders of Hungary, but kings considered it as part of the country.
Serbia also laid its claim for this territory, and Charles I launched several campaigns to get it.
The king organised this ban district in 1320, which survived till 1479.
Alternatively many Hungarian counties belonged under its supremacy: Valkó, Bodrog, Szerém, Baranya, Bács, Tolna.
With the exception of Belgrade, the parts beyond the river Sava were taken by Serbia after 1389.
After the battle of Kosovo polje in 1389 in Serbia - which was the vassal state of the Turks -Stephen Lazarevics, who was said to be a despot, entered into alliance with King Sigismund around 1403, became member of the Dragon Association and received large gifts in Hungary.
Before his death in 1426 he signed a contract with Sigismund, according to which his heir in Serbia and on his estates in Hungary would be his nephew, George Brankovics, who promised to give Belgrade (Nándorfehérvár) and Galambóc [Golubac] to the Hungarians.
The captain of Golubac gave the fortress to the Turks, and the attempt to take it back - in 1428 - was not successful.
Between Szörény and Galambóc Hungary became the direct neighbour of the Osman empire.
In the 14th century Bosnia became independent, its rulers acknowledged Hungarian vassalage with varying breaks till the Turkish conquest.
In the 14th century the members of the Kotromanic dynasty ruled, first Louis the Great's father-in-law, Stephen II.
 This was the last dynastic relation with the south Slav ruling family, and it came to an end when the Turks pressed forward.
In 1377 Tvarko was crowned king of Bosnia and Serbia with permission from the Hungarians.
During the reign of Sigismund Bosnia seemed to be a hesitating vassal, so Hungarian armies occupied part of the one-time ban district of Ozora together with Srebernik in 1404 and Jajca in 1434.
Dalmatia was not a unified country. It consisted of city states along the coast, which had their own local governments and which led different policies.
Charles I acknowledged that these cities surrendered to Venice, only Zeng remained under Hungarian supremacy.
Hungarian rule lasted from 1358 to 1412 in Dalmatia.
In 1420 Spalato and Trau also surrendered to Venice, and after this the right of Hungarian kings over Dalmatia became nominal, only Raguza remained under Hungarian authority.
In contrast to the above mentioned countries, Croatia had close contacts with Hungary.
According to the principle of the dynastic share of power between 1353-1356 the country was governed by Prince Stephen together with Slavonia, then he was followed by his child son.
After this Dalmatia and Croatia was directed separately from Slavonia till 1476 - by bans.
The country was divided into several districts (zsupánság), which were quite different from Hungarian counties.
Croatia and Slavonia bordered upon Krajna, Slavonia and Hungary were the neighbours of Styria, Hungary bordered upon Styria and Austria - the part called Lower Austria.
The district under the power of marquis Cilli became independent for two decades at the end of Sigismund's reign, so it became the neighbouring country of Slavonia.
In Krajna, Styria and Austria the Habsburg dynasty ruled.
To the north of the river Morva was Moravia under the supremacy of the Czech kings. Silesia, which was bordered by part of the country of Trencsén, also belonged under the authority of the Czech crown.
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY
The king
Between 1370 and 1382 Hungary was in a personal union with Poland.
The two countries were governed separately.
It is wrong to talk about the empire of the "three seas", since though the Polish laid their claims on Pomerania, in reality Poland did not have a coast at that time.
Under the reign of Louis the Great Moldavia, which was the vassal state of Hungary, had some ports at the Black Sea but the Hungarian king had no influence on these.
Wallachia did not have any coasts, and Dobrodgen was a Bulgarian territory.
Louis the Great owned only the Dalmatian ports at the Adriatic Sea.
In the middle of the 14th century the Angevines renewed the dynastic share of power for a short time.
During the reign of Charles I his sons received the title of prince; Louis became Prince of Transylvania and Stephen Prince of Slavonia, but neither of them governed their country alone.
Stephen had his own court in 1349, as he was Prince of Szepes and Sáros, then Transylvania.
From 1351 he became Prince of Croatia and Dalmatia, from 1353 Prince of Slavonia as well.
A year after, when he died, his child son, John, bore this title.
In 1356 the separate government was abolished, so the dynastic separate government was terminated in Hungary forever.
Slavonia was considered an independent country, but the title of the Slavonian king was not used by the rulers - just the same as before.
Transylvania was not called a country, only a "Transylvanian part".
The leading voivodes of Transylvania bore the title of the ispán [head of local government] of Szolnok, and in the 14th century also the title of the ispán of Arad county.
The bans of Macsó had a power similar to that of the voivodes and the bans of Slavonia.
In their territories the ispáns were appointed by them, and they had independent law courts.
During the 15th century the office of the ban and voivode was taken by several persons at the same time.
The voivodes usually did not come from Transylvanian families.
Louis the Great, in case he was away for a long time, was substituted by his mother as a governor; Sigismund was substituted by his so-called 'vicarious'.
The most important decisive body besides the king was the royal council, which consisted of prelates, barons and some gentlemen from the court.
Common nobility represented themselves at the parliament, which was convoked many times in the first part of Charles's reign, and twice during the reign of Louis the Great. Nevertheless the decisive power was in the hands of prelates and barons.
In 1385, at the diet, where Little Charles was elected king, each county was represented by 4 representatives for the fist time in Hungarian history.
Laws were enacted without the consent of the diet several times later, based on the opinion of the royal council.
Counties and law courts
In the bigger part of the country counties were responsible for the local government.
Newly settled regions were organised into counties at this time, for example, Liptó, Turóc, Máramaros.
At the head of them there were the ispáns, who were usually ispáns of several counties simultaneously.
Their substitutes, the vice ispáns, were appointed by them from among their familiares.
The only regular forum of the counties were the law courts, which gathered every two weeks at a definite time and place. This was called sedria, a word borrowed from Latin.
Usually only the vice ispáns took part at these meetings, and they were helped by the chief magistrates, who were appointed by the nobility.
In the 14th century town-clerks were employed in more and more counties.
Smaller administrative districts became popular at that time, too. their number was usually the same as the number of chief magistrates. These districts were the units of tax collecting, and not local governments.
Starting from the age Sigismund the role of castle districts in state administration became more and more important, so we can speak about the local governments of counties from this time on.
Slavonian counties functioned similarly to Hungarian counties, with the exception of the so-called Lower Slavonian counties (Szana, Orbasz and Dubica). They had a special status.
In certain parts of the country not counties but chairs (law courts) were organised.
Cuman chairs were based on nationalities.
Originally each chair had its nationality. There were 6 Cuman chairs, the existence of the independent Jász chair was dubious in this period.
Originally the Székelys had 7 chairs.
After breaking down the 1324 Saxon revolt the government of the Saxon region was completely reorganised.
The Saxon chairs were established then, but these did not cover all the Transylvanian regions where Saxon people lived.
The Székelyföld (Székelyland) did not belong directly under the authority of the Transylvanian voivode, its government was headed by the Székely ispán.
The Székely ispáns were not Székelys, they directed the Saxon chairs called "two chairs" till 1402.
Rumanian districts (kenéz) remained within the boundaries of the county, these were usually organised around a bigger castle.
In the Szepesség three forms of government existed simultaneously: the county, the community of the Saxons of the Szepesség and the ten-spear chair.
In 1412 Sigismund put the castle of Lublo, the oppidi of Lublo and Podolin and further 14 "free villages" from Szepes into pawn for the Polish king, Ulaslo II.
This part of the Szepesség [Zipps] was reannexed to Hungary only in 1772.
The local governments of the region could survive without a change in their legal status: they were considered part of the Hungarian Kingdom (Holy Crown).
Finance
The incomes of the country were the incomes of the king as well.
The rulers considered the matters of the treasury or chamber as matters of their own private estates.
Financial matters were controlled by local chambers, which depended first on the keeper of the treasury, then on the royal treasurer, with the chamber ispáns at the head of them. They rented these local chambers for a sum, which was recorded in a contract.
The chambers were engaged in special activities. The salt chambers, for example, had nothing to do with mine chambers, which dealt with the mining of non-ferrous metals.
In the course of his financial reforms, Charles I had 10 minting chambers set up, and each chamber had several mints.
Credible places
Credible places were the local institutions of authenticated literacy. They issued reports on investigations made by judicial command, or so-called 'confessions' following the request of private persons.
The 1351 laws interdicted smaller convents from issuing charters in which estates were alienated.
Two years later the signets of all the credible places were supervised, and only those could continue their activities that got their signets back.
After this during the Middle Ages the number of chapters and convents which dealt with issuing charters did not really change.
Royal residence and capital city
Since the beginning of the 14th century Buda was considered the capital city of the country.
The residence of the royal court with central law courts was Visegrád from 1323 to 1405-1408, they moved to Buda only between 1346 and 1355.
Visegrád, however, had never been the capital, only a residence. Royal residences were not identical with capital cities in other European countries either.
The separateness of the permanent residence and the capital city was the last temporary stage in the long development in the course of which the residence-capital, that is the residence and the capital together, came into being.
The royal castle and the new palace was built during Sigismund's reign in the place of today's palace complex.
During his reign Sigismund wanted to move his residence to Pozsony, which lay on the borderline of the German-Roman Empire. He had that castle rebuilt then.
SETTLEMENTS AND PLACES OF LIVING
Towns
In 1301, when the Árpád dynasty became extinct, most Hungarian towns were surrounded by walls built after the Tartar Invasion.
In the western part of Europe these fortified towns appeared much earlier, at least 100 years before.
The development of farming, the cultivation of new territories enabled villages to produce extra food.
This relative surplus of goods caused a growth in population, as a result of which more and more people decided to leave their villages to find work and place to live in the towns.
In these urban settlements handicraft industry also produced surplus goods.
Because of the increasing exchange of goods contemporary church institutions seemed unsatisfactory and markets were formed near fortresses, which grew out of the local bounds.
Long distance trade became very important.
At the beginning of the 13th century the Latins of Fehérvár originated their letter of privilege - which contained their urban rights - from King St Stephen. This is called the freedom of Fehérvár.
On the basis of this several other towns managed to gain similar privileges. These were Nagyszombat in 1238, Nyitra in 1248, Gyõr and Szatmár in 1271, Sopron in 1277 and Vasvár in 1279.
Many other towns dreamt of similar rights even in the 14th century.
The most important element of these rights was that they were exempt from paying customs duties.
The right for holding markets nationwide was also a significant privilege.
Besides Fehérvár only a few towns had this right: for example, Buda from 1287, Sopron and Pozsony from 1344, Kassa from 1347 and the Transylvanian Beszterce from 1353.
The role of the new capital, Buda became more and more significant.
While the most important trade routes were controlled by Fehérvár till the end of the 13th century, this was taken over by Buda after the time of the Tartar Invasion.
Since the end of the 13th century the privileges of Buda are mentioned very often as an example, but Korpona, or for the mining towns Selmecbánya and Teschen were also set as examples.
The legal unification of town privileges started only in the middle of the 14th century.
The majority of towns, surrounded by walls as a result of the 1241-1242 Tartar Invasion, were large towns earlier, too.
Fehérvár, for example, was a large town at the end of the Árpád age, by the end of the 15th century it had a territory of 1780 hectares.
It was impossible (and there was no point) to surround this huge territory with walls, so with the building of the town walls city blocks and streets were cut.
The surrounded inner city was first mentioned between 1259 and 1270.
Its territory is quite small compared to the whole city, it was only 20.8 hectares - one ninth of the territory of Fehérvár at the end of the 15th century.
The artificially formed suburbs are mentioned by charters from this time on: the suburbs of Buda from 1331 as suburbium, in 1406 as civitas exterior, the New Town was mentioned in 1327 as the Island, the Swamp in 1372 as Inguan, the New Village in 1298 as Nova Villa.
The same thing can be seen in the case of Esztergom - Royal town, Gyõr, Körmöcbánya, the Watertown of Buda, Pécs and Pozsony.
It was a typical urban problem that the dwellers did not have enough space inside the city walls and left the city.
The solution was that the territory of the city was enlarged with a new section of the city wall, as in the case of Ruszt, Nándorfehérvár and Brassó, where large suburbs were established outside the town walls.
These parts, which grew like cells, were later incorporated by the city, or they received a fortification wall as suburbs (Gyõr, Nagyszeben, Pécs, Sopron).
Pozsony received its city walls in 1311, Nagyszombat, Bártfa, Eperjes, Kõszeg, Trencsén, Kismarton and Szakolca were fortified in the 14th century.
The majority of towns were built near a fortress, their markets were controlled by the owner of this fortress.
These fortresses were in the possession of the King, Queen, an archbishop, a bishop or a count, They were not only built on top of hills (Brassó, Eger, Esztergom, Selmecbánya, Szalónak, Trencsén, Veszprém, Visegrád and Zólyom), but also they could be within the city walls - sometimes they were built earlier (Pécs - the bishop's castle), sometimes they were separated by a moat (Fehérvár - newer royal castle, Késmárk, Kolozsvár, Kismarton).
Until the middle of the 15th century there were no big changes in the fortification of the cities, which were built earlier, at the end of the 13th - at the beginning of the 14th century.
The relatively high city walls preserved their form, which were dissected by towers of round, horse-shoe, semi-circle or square ground-plans.
Towns built in more dangerous places were surrounded by wide moats. There were wooden bridges, which could be pulled up, above them in front of the two or three city gates.
These gates were protected by separate gate towers.
Contemporary castles had similar defence systems. These castles were usually built on top of hills.
The spread and general use of canons in city sieges can be dated to the end of the 15th century - beginning of the 16th century. So they did not influence the architecture of this period.
Fortification walls were thin and very high, since they were built against the enemy approaching the fortress on ladders, and not against canons.
Archers shot at the attackers, who wanted to occupy the fortress from the towers.
Inside the cities a separate fence protected the parish church (Bártfa, Besztercebánya, Brassó, Eperjes, Földvár, Lõcse, Nagyszeben, Szepesszombat, Zólyom) or the royal basilica and the attached building complex (Székesfehérvár).
In many cases the cathedral or church stood in the territory of the inner fortress (Óvár, Eger, Kolozsvár, Esztergom, Körmöcbánya, Pécs, Stegosaur, Selmecbánya).
In planned cities there was a regular system of streets and a central, square market place.
Beszterce, Korpona, Kolozsvár and Lõcse had such market places in the 13th century, but Pécs and Gyõr also followed their example.
The houses and city walls of Körmöcbánya, which was founded by 36 families, were built around a huge square market place on more than 10.000 square meters.
The city received some privileges in 1328. The city walls were finished only in 1426.
Cities which became rich from gold mining built smelting furnaces. Wine-trading also made the citizens rich.
The palace of the market place was a widening road, especially in towns which were formed spontaneously along busy trade routes (Gölnicbánya, Besztercebánya, Eperjes, Kassa, then the cities which received the title of 'oppidum': Pásztó, Szászsebes, Szepesszombat, Zólyom).
There was another development in the second half of the 14th century: the trade connections of cities became firm.
Their legal situation became stabilised, too. Their development depended on what extent they could take part in long distance trade.
New mines were open, which led to the formation of new mining towns (Aranyosbánya, Nagybánya, Felsõbánya, Körmöcbánya, Telkibánya, Zólyomlipcse, Rózsahegy).
More than 20 settlements received the title of city by the middle of the 14th century.
After the rivalling at the beginning there was a cooperation in the Angevine age, first of all in lawsuits (the Saxon right of Szepes, the court of appeal of seven Saxon law courts).
Since the second half of the 14th century the right of Buda became the model, but around 1370 several cities demanded the same rights as Korpona.
Since 1383 the law court of the master of the treasury employed lay members as well.
City dwellers were also engaged in farmwork in this age, too. In the 15th century, however, more and more people were employed in the handicraft industry.
At the beginning of the 15th century this meant about one third of the population.
In the agricultural production of towns the cultivation of corn and the wine-growing played a very important role (Sopron, Pozsony, Fehérvár, Buda, Kassa).
Wine cellars, farm yards - that is village buildings - characterised the picture of the city, which showed a closer, urbanised form only from the 15th century.
Privileged rights to hold markets or deal with local or long distance trade remained the basic privileges.
Foreign trade became very important, just as water or land routes.
At the turn of the 14th-15th centuries, then in the 15th century new types of cities were designed.
Stone cuttings, decorative windows, doors and balconies appeared on the facade of houses (Buda, Sopron, Fehérvár).
Parish churches became richly decorated, too, which was the symbolic proof of the wealth of the citizens.
By the 15th century some of the Hungarian cities reached Western-European standards.
The 1405 decree meant a legal stabilisation for them.
But several cities were put in pawn (Sárvár, Sárospatak, Sátoraljaújhely, Kõszeg), the 1405 decree helped the development of market towns and it was an important result.
Fortresses
Fortresses were built separately, near towns or as an organic part of cities.
At the beginning of the 14th century all the fortresses had high walls dissected by towers.
Fortresses which were built in towns, or to protect towns stood near important trade routes or near the intersection of these.
The majority of fortresses were built as the centres of estates, or part of the defence line of borders.
The gate tower survived from old castles till the 14th century, but we can find some even in the 15th century.
Their basic area was 10-12 x 10-12 meters, and some of their rooms could be heated.
The core of the Visegrád fortress consists of such a gate tower and palace wings attached to it.
Along fortification walls new buildings, residences were built in the 14th century, enriching the old fortress with castles and yards (Trencsén).
It is typical that the fortress walls were fortified with new walls, creating wall passes with this (Zwinger).
The building of the fortress and palace of Diósgyõr - which had a square ground-plan and four corner towers - was attributed to King Louis the Great.
The construction works and enlargements of the royal fortress of Buda and Visegrád were also carried out then. They show a strong Italian influence.
The fortress of Végles - without corner towers - was built in Sigismund's age. It had a square ground-plan as well.
The fortress of Gesztes had a regular ground-plan, with a square yard in the centre.
The buildings around the central yard (palace wings) could also be found in the new royal fortress of Fehérvár, which had a square ground-plan, too. King Béla IV had it built at the end of the 13th century.
The fortresses of Kismarton and Kõszeg also had similar palace wings around their central yards.
Monasteries
Monastic orders functioned and built their buildings since the age of the founding of the state.
The Benedictine monks, who appeared first, then the Cistercians and Premontrians founded several monasteries.
Their constructions were of high standards. They rebuilt or enlarged old churches and monasteries, so they played an important role in contemporary architecture.
However, in the development of cities at the end of the 13th century only the activity of begging orders was significant: first of all the monasteries of Franciscans and Dominicans appeared in urban settlements.
Besides them the Karthausinas, Augustine hermits, the Paulines and the Carmelites raised monasteries.
According to the 1303 inventory the Dominican monks and nuns built their homes in prospering cities (Esztergom, Vasvár, Pécs, Csázma, Székesfehérvár), or in developing cities after the Tartar Invasion (Buda, Pest, Margaret Island, Sárospatak, Nagyolaszi, Nagyszombat, Kassa, Selmecbánya, Nagyszeben, Segesvár).
Not long after the Dominicans, the Franciscans also started their activities.
In 1316 they had 43 monasteries in Hungary and in Slavonia, while the Dominicans had only 35.
The first Franciscan monasteries were built in Beszterce, Buda, Esztergom, Székesfehérvár, Szombathely, Gyõr, Nagyszeben, Pest, Nagyszombat, Szeged and Sárospatak.
The Augustine hermits were less significant, they had only 22 monasteries at the end of the Middle Ages: the most important ones were in Esztergom, Székesfehérvár, Gyulafehérvár and Pécs.
Besides the begging orders the number of hermits had significantly increased by the 14th century.
There were a few Karthausians (in the Szepesség and the Bakony mountains),but the only monastic order which was founded in Hungary, the Pauline order was much more popular.
The hermits probably asked Pope Orban IV (1261-1264) for a permission in the name of Özséb and his company to let them use St Augustine's regulations as the basis of their life.
The Pauline hermits, who became an order at the end of the 13th century, founded a monastery at Budaszentlõrinc in 1301, which became the centre of the order.
In 1327 there were around 30 Pauline monasteries, and by the end of the Middle Ages their number was about 80.
The majority of Pauline monasteries were built near cities. They had no monasteries on the Great Plain.
Landlords played an important role in the lives of monastic orders. They gave donations to the Franciscans and Paulinas as advowees, since they chose their burial places in their monasteries in the 14th-15th centuries.
The Paulines built their monasteries far from the towns, in woody places in the mountains, but they also had some monasteries in bigger cities or near them (Szalónak, Huszt, Bereg).
In contrast to this the Franciscans were a typical urban monastic estate, but they had some monasteries in villages as well.
The number of their monasteries was around 80 at the end of the Middle Ages.
The Franciscans had monasteries in Bártfa, Buda, Pest, Debrecen, Eger, Esztergom - royal town, Gyöngyös, Gyõr, Kassa, Eperjes, Kolozsvár, Nagyszeben, Nagyszombat, Nagyvárad, Pécs, Pozsony, Sopron and Székesfehérvár.
Dominican monks and nuns had monasteries in Beszterce, Brassó, Buda, Pest, Debrecen, Gyõr, Gyulafehérvár, Kassa, Kolozsvár, Nagyszeben, Pécs, Segesvár and Székesfehérvár.
Clarissan monasteries were built in Brassó, Nagyszeben, Nagyszombat, Pozsony, Segesvár and Óbuda.
Carmelite monasteries can be found in the suburbs of Buda, in Eperjes, Privigye and Pécs.
Begging orders built their cloisters in the edge of cities, in most of the cases near city walls. They had rarely built monasteries along inner streets or near city gates.
They found empty places only in the suburbs, as they usually needed one quarter of a hectare territory for this.
The most important building of monasteries was the church.
Churches of the begging orders had long, narrow naves, which were separated from the chancel by a triumphal arch and the lettner in the east.
Till the 13th century the longish chancels had straight closings, but from the 14th century on they had Gothic chancels with pillars and octagonal closing.
Pillars were needed because the walls were not strong enough to hold the weight of the vault.
The carved ribs of Gothic churches formed beautiful net vaults.
The huge painted glass windows with stone bars (tracery) let the light through into the church.
The tower of the churches of begging orders were built to the northern side of the chancel, near the nave or in front of the chancel closing.
But in the case of a few 13th-century monasteries the tower was built in front of the western facade.
In this period people were buried in the nave or chancel of the church or in the yard of the monastery. The tombs were covered with carved stone sheets.
Monasteries were built in the southern side of the church, but sometimes they were in the northern side (Zalaszentgrót, Óbuda, Szécsény, Szeged).
In the centre of the monastery was the ambulatory, and an entrance to the nave of the church.
This corridor surrounded a square yard.
There was a well-house in the yard, which was the pride of the monastery in most cases.
From the ambulatory one could go to the important rooms, such as the chancel, near the sacristy, which was next to the chapter room.
The kitchen, the heating room, the refectorium (dining hall), and dormitories were also here.
Many monasteries had hospitals, guest houses, or separate chapels.
A farm yard and farm buildings also belonged to the monastery.
Usually the whole building complex was built in a closed system, the external parts were surrounded by a fence.
Villages
In the 14th-15th centuries the majority of Hungarian settlements were villages.
Between cities and villages there were the market towns (oppidum) in juristic and geographical sense. Market towns were village-like settlements, but their basic area was much bigger.
Concerning the jobs and social status of the dwellers of villages they show a great diversity.
There were 'noble villages' (e.g.: Sarvaly) and 'villein' villages (such as Szentmihály and Csút).
By the end of the 14th century more than half of the settlements had churches.
These village churches were usually built in the centre of the settlement or at a significant place.
Within the circle or oval fence there was the cemetery, where more generations were buried.
In the 13th century in these small villages with 18-20 houses the church had one nave and the chancel had a semi-circular or horse-shoe shaped closing.
At the end of the 13th century, at the beginning of the 14th century these were rebuilt into chancels with square closing.
Later Gothic chancel closings, vaulted spaces, pillars and Gothic details were also used.
Villages can be divided into two categories concerning their arrangement: regular (with streets) and irregular villages.
Land pieces were attached to the houses, where one-room pit houses were replaced by two-, later three-room houses, which were sometimes made of stone.
Handicraft industry was very important in villages besides farming. They included smithery, tailoring, shoemaking and pottery.
During the archaeological opening of village houses, bones of wild animals were found in the kitchen waste, which refers to the fact that the domestication of animals was not developed yet.
WAY OF LIFE
SOCIETY
The inhabitants of the country
In the 1330s the Pope's tithe-collectors visited Hungary.
Their records of the collected sums survived, though only in fragments.
According to these, the population of Hungary together with Slavonia might have been around 2 million.
The great plague broke into the Carpathian Basin in 1349, and at the end of 1359 another plague spread throughout the country. There are no data concerning the number of the victims of these plagues.
Famines were quite insignificant in Hungary, though they occurred regularly in other European countries.
The great decrease in the population, which was rather typical of European countries in this period, did not seem to happen in Hungary, since the population of the country may have been around 3-3.5 million in the 1430s.
In Hungary, as in Western Europe, social groups were called estates, and belonging to an estate was called condition.
The estate was the community of people with identical rights. Financial differences could be very large among people in the same estate.
Belonging to an estate was defined by birth, the possibility of moving to another estate was rather slight.
The privileges of social groups were called freedoms, so we can talk about the freedom of noblemen and hospeses.
The 14th century was the century of juristic unification.
In its first decades the rights of noblemen, by the middle of the century the rights of villeins became unified throughout the country.
Unified nobility and villeins
The estate of the nobility included royal servants and a certain part of castle villeins besides the real noblemen.
The "one and the same nobiliary freedom" declared by the 1351 laws did not mean that they had identical rights from that time on - this was accepted decades before - but it referred to the situation of noblemen living beyond the river Drava and in Transylvania, whose legal situation was different from that of the noblemen of Hungary.
Landowners were also called noblemen independent of the size of their estates, and both a single piece of ground and a domain could be considered a noble estate.
A noble estate did not belong to a certain family but to the whole clan.
The ancient estate was inherited within the clan.
Aviticity was not invented by Louis the Great, he only justified the already existing legal theory in his 1352 law in a way that he invalidated a regulation in the Golden Bull, which scarcely or never was practiced.
The 1351 ruling was made in the defence of royal rights, so the property of those who died without a male successor would fall back on the king.
At the beginning of his reign, Louis the Great introduced the system of the new gift, which was quite disastrous for clan possessions.
In the second half of the 14th century the ancient noble clans became divided, they lived their lives as independent families, only the ancient estate and the common coat-of-arms reminded them of their kinship.
Members of noble families who received gifts through their services at the court did not share them with other members of the clan.
In the age of the Angevine rulers and at the beginning of the Sigismund age the real dividing line within the nobility was between court and country nobility. Through court services one could join the group of barons as well.
Barons were the main office bearers of the country in the age of the Angevine kings.
Their number decreased first around 1350, and from this time on the county ispáns [bailiff] - with the exception of the ispán [bailiff] of Pozsony - did not belong to their group.
Ex-office bearers were also barons, but their children were not yet barons at that time.
The closed estate of noblemen started to take shape after Sigismund's great gifts, the basis of which was not exclusively the office, but also the estate obtained by succession.
Noblemen living at the court, who did not bear the title of baron, were divided into three groups: court knights, court youths and court pages.
The basis of this categorisation was not their age, but their origin and merits.
Court noblemen took part in the everyday practice of governing.
They and the barons received not only an estate as a gift, but also an office estate called the 'honour', which could be repossessed by the ruler at any time, but the profit of the honour estate was their legal due.
Country estate owner noblemen were called common noblemen.
They could not intervene in politics, they could represent themselves only in county administration.
Noblemen with a single estate lived like peasants.
From both groups several people served a lord or joined his family, this is why they were called familiares.
However real a social group they formed, court nobility and the familiares did not become an estate. Their members were considered noblemen just as their lords.
This was because according to contemporary Hungarian law everyone was a nobleman who had his own estate.
There were noblemen living in various parts of the country, who had different and more restricted rights than the noblemen of the homeland. They were called local or particular noblemen.
The immunity from taxes of the noblemen living beyond the river Drava was declared only in 1351, and the right of the Transylvanian noblemen for noble-courts was also acknowledged at that time.
The different condition of the noblemen of Liptó and Turóc, or the ten-spears of Szepes was in connection with their ancient origin and closed geographical situation.
Ecclesiastical noblemen, the so-called praedialists, were not considered real noblemen. They lived on ecclesiastic estates and performed  administrational duties in times of peace, and fought on the side of their lords in times of war.
Under the unclear political conditions of the turn of the 13-14th centuries the institution of royal castle disappeared, and so did the social layers connected to it: servants and castle villeins. The organisation of royal equerries was also dissected.
Peasants living on other people's estates were uniformly called villeins from the middle of the 14th century, no matter if they lived on royal, nobiliary or ecclesiastic estates.
Villeins could be liberated servants, who received lands from their lords, people of royal castes, impoverished castle villeins, equerries or hospeses.
Their rights and duties were defined after the pattern of the rights of earlier hospeses.
Villeins could use their lands freely, later the lands were inherited by their descendants.
If a villein paid for his debts and land rents, he was free to move to another landlord.
This free movement was often impeded by the landlords, so it had to be enstrengthened by a law in 1391.
To their landlords villeins had to pay the land rent in cash, give presents in products, for example, lambs, cakes, and they had to pay ninth after certain products, for example wine and land products.
The labour service [robot], which had to be performed in the landlord's farmstead, was quite insignificant then.
Land rent and presents had to be paid at different times depending on the traditions of the given region.
The services of the villeins were regulated by customary law.
In spite of juristic uniformity, there were big differences in the services of villeins, depending on which earlier social layer their ancestors originated from.
For the last time equerries were differentiated from villeins in the age of Sigismund.
Hospeses kept their better position throughout the Middle Ages at many places.
In the course of inheritance, estates became smaller and smaller. Villeins owned half, quarter, or even a smaller part of these estates, and in the 15th century the average size of an estate was a quarter-estate.
Peasants who possessed their own houses - not estates - were called cottars, they worked for wages or rented their lands.
The landlords had to defend their villeins - if it was needed, even by force. They also had to provide administration of justice at their private court.
Since the reign of Charles I first of all the barons, but more and more court noblemen received power of life and death, so in their estates they could administer justice not only in minor cases and over their own villeins, but also over all criminals who were caught there.
The estate of the landowner, who obtained power of life and death, got out of the juristic power of the county ispán [bailiff], so this right is called 'free of ispánship [bailiff]' in Hungarian.
Ethnic minorities and privileged groups
Settling people to the borderlines of the country was continued in the 14th century.
On the one hand there were not enough people in the country for this, on the other hand these woody mountain regions required special farming methods, so the new inhabitants of these territories came from abroad.
Owing to these big settlements the population did not decrease in Hungary - which was quite general in Europe then - and the borderlines of the country became inhabited by Slovak, Ruthenian and Rumanian people.
Besides the Slovaks, who always lived here, in the Upper Hungary, there were settlers from Moravia, Poland and the Russian principalities, mainly with the lead of German entrepreneurs, the so-called Soltesz-es.
They created new villages by cutting out woods.
Orthodox Ruthenians came to the Eastern Carpathians in large numbers in the 14th century.
Part of them lived according to vlach (Wallach) rights, that is they exclusively dealt with animal husbandry and they had to pay only the fiftieth tax.
In the 14th century there was a turn in Rumanian settlement.
Charles I legalised the practice which was used during the interregnum, when he let the landowners themselves settle down Rumanians in their estates, but the sheep fiftieth tax had to be paid to the king.
Wallach districts were organised for the Rumanian people living on royal estates, such districts were, for example, the Lugos, the Sebes, the Hátszeg and the Hunyad districts.
The Rumanian society was led by the kenéz-es.
The second wave of Rumanian settlement started then, from the east, from Moldavia.
The Rumanians came with the lead of the voivodes and they showed bigger social differences than their ancestors. They populated the Máramaros region on the left bank of the river Tisza.
The Rumanian voivodes of Máramaros organised the Moldavian principality.
The Székely and Saxon communities in Transylvania formed an independent, closed society.
The Székelys were divided into three estates: leading were the chiefs, under them the horse chiefs and then the common Székelys.
The early leaders of the Transylvanian Saxon society, the gerébs did not extend their nobiliary rights over the inhabitants of Saxon villages.
At the end of the 14th century their leading role was taken over by the leading bourgeoisie of towns.
In Saxon territories there were no Saxon villeins, the peasants remained free.
Because of Turkish attacks in the south, many villages were destroyed in the age of Sigismund.
This territory was later inhabited by Serbs, who escaped from the Balkans.
The assimilation of Cumans into Hungarian society meant gradually giving up their nomadic life style, their settling down and the adoption of farming life style.
The residences of clans became the Cuman chairs, their clan leaders became their residence captains, then later they became noblemen.
The Jász were first mentioned in the territory of the country in 1319. Besides today's Jászság [Jász land] they lived in Pilis county and in the region of the Lower-Danube.
They might have arrived in Hungary some decades earlier, but definitely after the Cumans.
Their language was not related to each other either: the Cuman spoke a Turkish language, while the Jász spoke an Indo-European language. By the 15th century both peoples used Hungarian elements in their languages.
Cities - citizens
The Angevine rulers continued their ancestors' policy to found cities.
However, not all the privileged cities fulfilled the expectations.
Only those were worth giving royal privileges that could live on their own. These cities lay along the main trade routes of the country.
At the beginning of his reign, Sigismund gave away several cities.
The free - that is privileged - royal - that is owned by the king - cities and villages were called together for a meeting by the king in 1405.
There was no similar other meeting in Hungarian history.
As a result of this meeting a decree was issued, which ordered that the royal privileged settlements be surrounded by walls, and introduced the usage of the Buda measurements as compulsory ones.
The court of appeal of royal towns was the court of the royal treasurer. Cities were given the power of life and death, and they were exempt from the staple right of Buda.
Later a small, elite group separated from the royal towns, which had special rights, compiled according to the Buda laws: Buda, Pozsony, Sopron, Nagyszombat, Kassa, Bártfa and Eperjes.
Another special group of cities was formed later, called private cities, and the Transylvanian Saxon and royal mining towns.
Next to cities surrounded by walls - the so-called keyed cities - boroughs were formed at the main market places of the country.
Mostly they were owned by private landlords, since the beginning of the 15th century castles were built in some of them, and they became aristocratic residences (Kismarton, Pápa, Gyula).
People who lived there were villeins, but in several boroughs they obtained significant privileges.
The dwellers of free royal towns and boroughs earned their living from farming, only the minority dealt with industry or trade.
The majority of the population of privileged Hungarian towns were German.
Till the beginning of the 15th century the leadership of significant towns was in the hands of a certain social layer, which followed court life, owned big estates and dealt with trade as well.
They often married daughters from aristocratic families, many of them became noblemen.
By the turn of the century most of these families died out and their place was taken over by city dweller merchants.
There was no such change in the mining towns, the descendants of the founding families - citizens, who had houses on the main square and big shares of the mines - kept their positions.
ECONOMICS
Agriculture
The bigger part of the population was engaged in agriculture.
The proportion of farming and animal husbandry differed from region to region. In the economy of the Cuman and Rumanian the role of animal husbandry was much more important than that of the cultivation of the land.
In the major part of the Carpathian Basin the regulated soil changing system was applied, while in the region of Transdanubia rotational farming was also used.
The difference between these two kinds of farming was that the ploughed land and fallow land were changed yearly and not every 4 or 5 years.
In rotational farming the uncultivated land is called fallow land and not waste land.
Where rotational farming was used three-course rotation was applied.
In case of rotational farming members of the village community had to accommodate to one another, it was the only possibility to defend the land from grazing animals.
In both farming systems the land which belonged to one estate was divided into smaller pieces near the village.
The individual pieces were distributed to the members of the village by shooting an arrow. This system is called 'distribution on the grass', because the individual pieces of land were separated by strips of grass.
At the forming of the system of land plots at every settlement a definite number of land plots of the same size belonged to an estate.
The size depended on the size and quality of the cultivated territory.
The size of the inner land - which included the house in the village, farm buildings and the garden - was also defined.
In Upper Hungary the system of "torunok" lands was popular, that is, the long-shaped plough-lands were situated directly behind the inner lands.
Here the land plots were not distributed after a certain time, but the farmers used the same piece of land for a long time.
The vineyard was outside the system of land pieces, since it was considered a cut-over area.
Usually one tenth of the wine was given to the landlord, this was the mountain tax.
As not every village possessed a mountain vineyard, it was not rare that people from different villages owned territories of vine in the same mountain.
Usually white wine was produced, if they needed red wine they coloured the white wine by adding blueberry, elder and sour cherry to it.
In the Transdanubia region besides treading, wine-presses were also used from the 13th century on. However, in the territory east of the Danube wine-presses were not applied.
Here pressed wine was considered worse than treaded wine.
The harvested grapes were treaded and pressed in the open air in the vineyard, further processing and storage were done at home.
There were no buildings (the so called 'cellars') in the vineyards yet, they were just started to be built in the Balaton region and South Transdanubia.
Animal husbandry, fishing, mills
Animal husbandry in Hungary not only satisfied the needs of local consumption but also cattle trade to the west and south, already began in the age of the Angevine rulers.
Large cattle, brought by the Cumans, were bred in the Great Plain.
These animals were kept in the open air, cow-houses spread outside the Great Plain.
Swine were kept in the woods - if it was possible - half in the open air.
In Transylvania the sheep keeping of the Rumanians was based on summer shepherding in the mountain and winter shepherding in the valleys.
Only the rich could afford to keep horses, but they were also used for cartage by villeins, their price was relatively low, comparing to Western Europe.
In the Middle Ages much fish was consumed, partly because of fasting days, partly because there was plenty of natural water suitable for fishing in the territory of the country.
At fishing places near natural waters fish were caught by anglers, at other places fishing ponds were created by damming up streams.
These latter ones were used by the members of the village jointly.
Water energy was most commonly used for milling corn.
For this purpose mills were built on streams or ship mills were used on rivers.
Millers paid a rent to the landlord for using the mill, in case of ship mills they paid for putting their mills into port.
Mining and minting coins
The gold mines of Körmöc, Szomolnok, Nagybánya, Abrudbánya and Zalatna were opened between 1320 and 1350.
These newly opened quarries made the minting of the golden forint possible.
That time Hungary produced approximately one third of the world's gold, and 90 % of Europe's gold.
There were silver mines as well, but the silver production of the country fell behind that of the Czech state, Saxony and Tirol.
The reform of mining and minting money was carried out in Hungary by adopting Czech experiences.
Körmöcbánya was founded by people who arrived from the Czech Kuttenberg, and the city received the Kuttenberg mining right.
In 1327 Charles I issued a decrete in which he assured landowners that he wouldn't take their lands if someone found precious metals in his estate, and that the owner himself could open a mine and keep one third of the urbura.
Louis the Great's 1351 law repeated this, but in practice almost all the precious metal mines were in the hands of the king.
In accordance with the system of free mining the citizens of mining towns were free to search for metals on royal and private estates.
The smelted metals had to be sold to the royal chambers at a fixed price, and the trade of uncoined metals was banned.
There is no data about the quantity of metal products, the only information we have is that in 1344 Queen Elisabeth - who went to Italy to act on Prince Andrew's behalf - brought 6628 kgs of silver, 5150 kgs of gold and golden forint coins with her.
By the 1370s mines were full of water and were exhausted, so the royal chamber, which was used to the rich incomes, was forced to apply the method of debasing the currency at the end of Louis the Great's reign.
Iron quarries in the age of the Árpád dynasty, such as the one at Vasvár, lost their importance.
The center of iron mining and metallurgy became the Szepes-Gömör ore mountain, and the city Dobsina.
The mine regale was not applied to iron mining.
The mines were in the possession of private landlords, and Bavarian, Tirolian and Austrian settlers were employed as workers there.
The hamor [small forging mills] was first mentioned in Hungary in 1344.
Iron mining in Torockó, in Transylvania probably also started in the 14th century.
The most important preservative of the Middle Ages was salt.
The salt of the Carpathians was 'cut' in cubes, salt wells - which were popular abroad - were very rare here, so there was no need for boiling salt.
Salt cutting did not require any particular technical knowledge or capital, compared to salt boiling, so there were no entrepreneurs in Hungarian salt mining, in contrast to precious metal or iron mining.
Besides the Transylvanian salt mines, the Máramaros salt mines became significant by the 14th century. By the end of the century the larger part of salt, which was put in circulation in the country, was produced here.
Salt was also mined in Sáros county.
Salt trading was a royal privilege, it was supervised by salt chamber ispáns [bailiff].
In the age of the Angevine rulers the bigger part of incomes of the treasury came from the exchange of precious metals. During Sigismund's reign the most important source of income originated from the salt monopoly, the second one was from the profit of the chamber, and the third one was the exchange of precious metals.
At the end of Sigismund's rule the annual total income of the treasury was around half a million of golden forints.
In the period between 1301-1437 the system of minting coins had completely changed.
Till the middle of the 14th century in the eastern part of the country, especially in Transylvania, people often paid and counted in uncoined silver bars, but by the age of Sigismund money economy became general.
During the reign of Kings Ottocar, Wenceslas and Charles I the minting traditions of the late Árpád age were continued.
Two kinds of silver coins were minted, the denarius and the half denarius (obulus).
There were many foreign coins circulating in the country, especially the Czech groat, which spread in the 20s.
Charles I started to have his golden forint minted probably in 1325, after Florentine patterns.
Since St Stephen, this was the first golden coin minted in Hungary, which was minted with the same weight and money rates through centuries.
Golden money was generally kept at home as treasure. In everyday circulation silver coins were used.
Charles I was the first to issue silver groats, following the Czech model, but these coins did not become a durable currency.
After 1369 only denariuses and small denariuses, which were worth fraction of a denarius and had different names in folk culture, were minted in Hungary for a century.
Minting signs, which referred to the place of minting and the officer of the chamber, appeared from the age of Charles I on.
In 1336 Charles I abolished the annual compulsory exchange of money in the countryside, and the income from this, the profit of the chamber, was changed into a royal tax collected yearly.
This was imposed on the plots of land of the villeins by gates, the sum was independent of the size and income of the farm. First 3 groats, later one fifth of a forint was collected by this right.
Noblemen, servants, ecclesiastic people, cities and one-time equerries were exempt from paying this tax.
In cities the compulsory exchange of money was performed in the traditional way for a time.
In 1338 this compulsory exchange was totally abolished. The minting of permanent denariuses started and the use of foreign coins was banned.
However, this regulation was not very long-lasting.
Louis the Great restored the system of compulsory exchange, but denariuses were only debased in the last years of his reign.
In 1390 Sigismund introduced a great currency reform: he had denariuses minted for a long time, and 100 of these were worth a golden forint.
After 1403 the currency was debased again, so in 1427 there was another money reform.
Besides centralised royal minting, coining in the ban district of Slavonia - which was started in 1255 - also survived till 1384. Between 1311 and 1355 the city of Buda also minted money.
At both of these places denariuses were minted, and theoretically both of them issued their money under royal authorisation.
Taxes
With a later expression the profit of the chamber was a regular tax, while war tax was an extraordinary tax, which was collected on special occasions.
In Slavonia, in counties Pozsega and Valkó beech skin tax, called marturina, was paid in cash.
Special taxes were imposed on cities, Jews, Transylvanian Saxons, Rumanians, Cumans and Székelys.
Though it was not a tax, but it also increased the income of the chamber when the office of an bishop was vacant, since in these cases ecclesiastical incomes, which were the legal duty of the bishop, went into the royal treasury.
Craftsmanship, trade
The bigger part of objects used in everyday life was produced by local peasant farms, the rest by the village craftsmen: smiths, coopers, furriers, shoemakers.
In cities specialised branches of industry also appeared and developed.
In 1379 in Sopron 11 % of the population was engaged in handicraft industry, while in 1424-27 20.5 % of them dealt with craftsmanship.
The first guilds also appeared then in Hungary.
In 1411 King Sigismund wanted to move all the barchent weavers of the country to Kassa, and gave them privileges.
In Bártfa textile bleaching was sponsored by royal privileges.
The greatest part of home trade was performed in cities.
The right of keeping markets could be received through a royal privilege.
In case of weekly markets the settlement which obtained this right could organise a market on a fixed day of the week. There could not be another market on the same day in the neighbourhood.
The most significant cities had two market days.
The right for keeping annual markets was rather rare, these were usually held on the day of the celebration of the patron saint of the city.
Hungary had to import industrial goods.
From the west they imported textile and iron products, and also precious metals and live-stock were brought from here - in spite of every kind of prohibition.
Hungary's most significant business partners were the south German cities.
Besides land transport, there was an important shipping route on the Danube between the western borderline and Buda.
EVERYDAY LIFE
Men's and women's clothes
Illustrated Chronicle: eastern and western-type clothes
No item of clothing survived from Hungary from the 14-15th centuries, so we must rely on written sources (testaments, inventories) or contemporary pictures.
Besides wall-paintings, tabloids, sculptures and the miniatures of codices seals - that authorised charters - and even tombstones provide information about the history of clothes.
However, medieval representations can be used as documents of cultural history only with reservations, since part of the clothes represented are 'ageless' clothes shown in pictures since the ancient times. Other parts are imitations, copies of the model work of art, and the emblems, objects seen in representations often have symbolic meaning.
King Louis the Great is depicted on the cover of the Illustrated Chronicle - from the second half of the 14th century.
The ruler sitting on his throne is wearing striped clothes, a cloak with ermine lining; and the members of his escort can be divided into two groups based on their clothes: there are armed knights in western-type armour on the King's right with swords and shields and men wearing eastern-type, kaftan-like clothes on his left, holding bows, arrows and sabres.
In this period this kind of duality was typical in Hungarian clothing: besides western fashion the spread of Cuman clothes could be seen from the second half of the 13th century. From the 15th century on Balkan, then, then increasingly, Turkish clothes began to spread.
Western-type clothes
The fashion of wearing loose clothes in several layers - each of these was made of the same material but they differed in colour - gathered up by the belt was still popular in the first decades of the 14th century.
We can see Charles I and the carrier of his arms, Thomas Semsei, captain of the Szepes fortress, in the wall-painting of the church of Szepeshely, made in 1317.
The big change in European fashion came from the 1340s, while in Hungary it came only later.
The most typical characteristic feature of the new fashion trend was that the overgarments followed the outline of the body, they became tighter and shorter.
We can recognise this new fashion - which appeared first at the court in Hungary, following the clothing of western aristocracy - in the miniatures of the Illustrated Chronicle.
Men's underwear were the swimming-suit-like, short underpants, the 'berhe'. We can see this in the picture which represents the self-scourging Flagellans.
The 'berhe' was fastened by a string around the waist, and the colourful tights (or in other words pants, as at that time these two things meant the same item of clothing) - covering the legs - were also fastened to this.
People carrying the soil at the siege of Krakow were wearing the same kind of tights - in the picture of the Illustrated Chronicle.
Shirts - worn as underwear on the upper body - became wide-spread only from the beginning of the 15th century.
We can see such a shirt in the escutcheoned letter given by King Sigismund to Kistárkány: a loose, linen shirt with closed neck and sleeves, which reached to the knees.
In the 14th century the colourful, tight-sleeved tunics were worn directly over the upper body.
Tunics, which reached to the knee, were tight to the hips, and under the hips they were slightly looser.
These tight clothes were fastened to the body by buttons, strings or straps.
Armour was worn over the tunic, coats of mail were a bit shorter than tunics.
The loose coats of mail, which were gathered up by a belt at the waist and were worn over the armour in the 12-13th centuries - went out of fashion by the beginning of the 14th century. Its last representation was from 1317, on the St Ladislaus wall-painting of Kakaslomnic.
Instead of the coat of mail, cloaks with hoods - reaching to the knee - or tight coats of mail were worn, or tight loin-cloths, which were made of leather and decorated at the bottom with cuts.
Belts lost their function, they were moved to the hips and they had a decorative role only.
If someone wanted to be elegant, he put on a tight coat over the tunic. Louis the Great was wearing such a coat on the cover of the Illustrated Chronicle.
These coats were often decorated with embroidery, lace or silver clasps. Multi-colour upper clothes or clothes sewn from stripes of various colours were quite popular.
To prevent the body from extreme weather conditions or for the sake of representation a knight's cloak with precious fur lining was worn over the coat.
Fashion was followed only by rich people, mainly the young dignitaries. Older people insisted on the traditional upper clothes which reached to the ankles.
We can follow the changes in men's fashion of the end of the 14th - beginning of the 15th century on the figures of the Buda sculpture findings.
The overgarment, which was worn over the shirt at that time, was called the 'dolmány' [dolman/pelisse] from the end of the century. This was a kind of tunic, tight to the waist, with split sleeves. It was loose and frilly under the belt.
The wide sheepskin coat ['suba'] or gown worn over the dolman or shirt was very elegant. It was made of velvet or brocade, with a fur collar or trimming, and it was often split at the side.
Hats or caps decorated with feathers or fur also belonged to everyday clothes.
Leather soles were added to tights, which covered the feet as well, against wear and tear. These soles were often strengthened with other thick leather or wooden soles.
Besides these dignitaries wore soft, short boots laced at the ankles, which were sometimes decorated with lace-like cuttings.
These boots were not very durable, so people bought several pairs of them, just like gloves. In spite of this fact, unbroken boots were found at several archaeological openings, which were in very good condition.
There was a strange thing in shoe-fashion in the 14th century: 'beaked shoes'. These shoes had very long toe-caps, which made even walking more difficult. These toe-caps were fixed by stiffenings or they were tied up. It did not spread in Hungary, though.
Eastern clothes
Long gowns or kaftans, high, pointed caps and boots with soft soles were typical Cuman clothes.
Kaftans - which originated from Central Asia - were gathered at the side and just like gowns from the Far East (e.g.: that we can see on the figures on the cover of the Illustrated Chronicle) were made of decent silk.
Weapon belts were important items of these clothes. Surprisingly, these belts were decorated with western motifs - according to the preserved samples.
In contrast with Christian traditions, Cuman men cut off their beards and wore thin moustache.
They shaved their head at the front and the remaining hair at the back was worn in a pony-tail.
Armour
The body of warriors was protected by wire or plated armour, but there were transitional armour-types between these two basic types.
The wire armour was a long-sleeved shirt made of flat rings of iron wire. At endangered places of the body it was covered with protective iron plates.
The scale armour was made of tiny metal sheets attached together. The popular brigand was a leather coat strengthened with iron stripes, lined with iron plates.
Members of the light cavalry, first of all the Cuman, wore leather armour made of several layers of leather.
The plated armour developed from the plates covering the endangered parts of the wire armour. From the 14th century larger and larger parts were covered with plates, and by the middle of the 15th century the whole body of the warriors was covered with iron plates.
A whole plate armour weighed 20-25 kgs and the independent chest-, back-, arm- and leg-plates were fixed by straps.
The hands were protected by armour gloves, the feet by armour boots.
A set of this armour was worth the price of several villages, so only a very few people could afford it.
There were several types of helmet in use for the protection of the head.
Cylinder-shaped cauldron or pot-helmets with flat tops went out of fashion by the 14th century.
Their place was taken over by cone-top helmets, which provided little space for hostile attacks.
The basic type of these were cone- or bell-shaped light helmets. The neck and shoulders were protected by a wire armour, which was attached to the helmet. The face, however, remained unprotected.
The totally closed bucket helmets and beaked helmets, used from the second half of the 14th century, were much safer. In case of beaked helmets the face was protected by a holed helmet visor, which could be opened up. It was riveted to the helmet.
Knights fighting in closed armours could be recognised by the coat-of-arms painted to their shields or by the helmet decoration on the helmet.
The earliest Hungarian coat-of-arms donations were in fact helmet decoration donations. Besides these the representations of shields were unimportant.
We can see the helmet decoration quite clearly on Thomas Széchényi's country judge seal - it is a lion with a crown growing out of the helmet -, but the shield is missing.
The helmet decoration of Angevine kings was an ostrich with a crown which bit into a horseshoe. Its representation survived on several relics.
The synod of Constanz was a turning point in the use of helmet decorations in Hungary: during their foreign travels Hungarian noblemen saw western coats-of-arms, and asked Sigismund for coat-of-arms donations in great numbers.
Weapons
The most important weapon was the sword; both of its basic types were used in Hungary.
The western-type double-edged, straight sword was the weapon of heavy cavalry, the bent sabre, which was widening towards the hilt, was the weapon of light cavalry. It was represented on contemporary pictures as the special feature of eastern clothing.
War knives and daggers were used in short distance fights as accessories of swords.
The best known crushing weapon of the age was the club.
The club heads were cast from bronze. They appeared in various forms, the most popular ones were the star-head clubs.
Crushing weapons were sabres and battle axes, which were made in various forms and size.
We can see battle axes on the different representations of St Ladislaus in Hungarian art: it was considered to be the attribute of the knight king, an emblem with the help of which people could easily recognise him.
In the wall-paintings of the St Ladislaus legend we can see all the contemporary weapons: the king and his escort went into the battle with spears, and the enemy, the Cuman held bows and arrows in their hand.
The size and form of spears depended on their use (e.g.: different spears were made for soldiers on horseback and infantrymen).
The most important long distance weapon was the bow, and its developed version, the flexbow.
Bows were used first of all by Cumans in the light cavalry.
In contemporary representations it was part of eastern clothing, just like the sabre, but its usage was not limited to this ethnic group.
In wall-paintings, miniatures we can see bows in flexed positions, and all of these were reflex bows of the same type.
The representation of quivers (arrows were stored in these) and bow protecting quivers was so clear in case of some pictures that experts could reconstruct them.
Women's clothes
The change in fashion in the 14th century had its influence on women's clothes, too.
The important feature of the new fashion was that it laid a stress on the body.
Instead of the closed clothes of the earlier centuries, which hid the form of the body, tight (to the waist and loose under the waist or hips) dresses with tight sleeves were worn with deep neckline.
This type of clothes had to be adjusted to the body of their wearer, so the 14th century was a turning point in tailoring.
The dress or skirt (at that time it was the same thing) was made of one piece, the waist part started high, under the breasts and the bottom of the dress was richly pleated.
At the beginning of the 15th century tight sleeves were replaced with loose ones: sleeves were often cut in or split, so the shoulder part of the shirt worn under the dress could be seen through these holes.
This shirt also appeared in the deep neckline of the dress.
Over the dress a cloak was worn against the cold, which was clipped together with a buckle or clasp at the neck.
The bottom of the cloak, or sometimes the bottom of the dress was decorated with fur.
The head - except for that of unmarried girls - was covered with veils or bennets. The material of these showed diversity, but the extreme trends of western fashion did not appear in Hungary.
The most fashionable clothes were worn by aristocratic girls and women. In the wardrobes of the bourgeoisie or common noblemen these appeared much later, in a low-quality version.
The textile of these clothes - both men's and women's clothes - showed the social status of the owner.
Golden brocade textiles, silks and velvets were worn by the members of the richest dignitary families, as they were very expensive.
The textiles themselves were imported as well, but the price depended on the place of origin and quality. Everybody could find the textile he or she could afford.
Jewels
Jewels had a duel role in the Middle Ages: on the one hand they were the means of pomp and representation besides clothes, on the other (besides decorative dishes) they were the easy way of accumulating and mobilising values and treasures.
Part of the jewels were used for fastening clothes, or were decorative elements on clothes. Such items were cloak clasps gathering cloaks, decorative buttons of clothes and the typical decorative elements of the age: metal buttons, rosettes, figures and heraldic motifs.
Besides the original items the casts were also found.
The most important accessory was the belt.
Fashionable belts of the age were the so-called 'head-dress belts' worn on the hips.
The fashionable items were made of metal thread and were decorated with gold or silver plates.
We can see such belts in the representations of the Illustrated Chronicle and on the secular figures of the Buda sculpture findings.
Belts were worn both by men and women, and they were part of both western and eastern clothing.
Golden necklaces and rings were worn by both sexes. Sometimes there were valuable crosses, relic holders or orders hanging from necklaces.
The most valuable jewels were worn at the royal court, but these did not survive.
According to written sources, Charles I was buried with a golden crown on his head, boots with golden spurs and precious stones on his feet and the three knights representing the king in the funeral procession were wearing the war emblem of the king decorated with a golden crown. These knights and also their horses were wearing a lot of pearls and precious stones, even the harnesses were made of gilded silver.
The king's widower, Queen Elisabeth left a golden head-dress to her granddaughters in her testament, but she also left crowns with precious stones and pearls to the Clarissan nuns of Óbuda.
The lily crown found in Sigismund's tomb at Várad was originally made as a relic crown (not for personal use) in the 14th century.
The gilded silver lilies are decorated with precious stones and pearls of different colours.
The decorative cloak clasps that Louis the Great donated to the Hungarian chapel of Aachen were made to the order of the court.
The two bigger and four smaller gilded silver, enamelled clasps represent Louis the Great's coat-of-arms. The interesting form of the bigger ones followed architectural tabloids.
The treasures found at archaeological excavations supplement the picture based on written sources and contemporary representations.
The owner of the findings of Kelebia, which consists of 97 pieces, was the Ban of Macsó, Paul's wife. Among the treasures there were cloak clasps, earrings, bracelets, rings, buttons, decorative plates and discs as well.
The treasure of Körmend from the 14th century also included buttons, seal-rings. The findings of Kiskunhalas also contained some clothes-mountings and rosettes.
These jewels were made by Hungarian masters in a great number, according to the preserved casts.
The belts and belt-mounts are quite valuable among these treasures.
The belt of Kígyóspuszta, decorated with the picture of fighting knights, was found in the one-time residence of the Cumans. When it was altered at the beginning of the 14th century, buttons with Latin writings (prayers to saints) were added to it. The belt of Felsõszentkirály with a shield decoration, whose owner died around 1350, was also found in this region.
Further decorative belts were found from the end of the 14th- beginning of the 15th century: the silver plate of the Nagytállya was decorated with a hawking woman; and the belt of Kerepes was decorated with leaves.
The 14th-15th centuries was the period of founding secular orders of knighthood throughout Europe. These orders had their own emblems.
There are no data about the activity of the first Hungarian order of knighthood, the St George order, founded by Charles I. Only its letter of foundation survived. But several relics of the Dragon Association - founded by King Sigismund in 1408 - were preserved.
The emblem of the order, a dragon formed into a circle, was worn by the members attached to their clothes, or as a jewel, hung in the neck or on a ribbon across the shoulders.
Sigismund was buried with the gold dragon hanging from his neck, but the emblem was lost during the opening of his tomb at Várad at the end of the 18th century.
The objects of everyday life
Furniture
During the 150 years between Charles I's accession to the throne and Sigismund's death everyday life changed substantially.
Demands increased in every layer of society: at the beginning of the 14th century the majority of castles consisted of a tower and the surrounding wall, and the leaders of cities lived in such towers, too.
By the end of the 14th century both castles and cities underwent a big change: within castle walls palaces and chapels were built, in cities two- or more-storey bourgeois houses appeared.
In the villages, however, three-part houses became quite wide-spread.
According to modern standards, buildings at that time were quite unfriendly, in most of the rooms there were only one or two pieces of furniture.
The most important item of furniture was the chest.
First of all, it was used for storing things, since people kept everything in chests, from flour to items of smithery. But it was also used for sitting or lying.
Its earliest type was the trough chest carved from one trunk, strengthened by iron stripes . The chest of Szepebéla - made in the 14th century - is a good example.
Carpentered chests were made by using a more developed technique (for example, the Rozsonda chest from Nagyszeben). They appeared and spread in Hungary only in the second half of the 15th century.
Tables were not very valuable in this period: they were set up from saw-horses and plane surfaces during meals, after that the table was taken apart.
People were sitting next to the table on benches; chairs were luxurious items even in the 15th century. In contemporary pictures they were firm, square, uncomfortable structures.
The base of beds were similar, prism-shaped structures, and since the 14th century bed-ends were attached to these.
People slept naked in bed, and there were several people sleeping in one bed.
In the 15th century there were beds already in the houses of villeins, though men - according to a tradition which was preserved till the 20th century - slept near the animals, in farm houses or stables.
Besides simple items of furniture, carpets and textiles, which provided comfort, played an important role.
Bedding: pillows, wadded quilts were quite valuable, they were part of dowries.
Bed-clothes were important in villein houses as well - social and financial differences appeared in quantity and quality of the textiles.
Only wealthy noblemen or citizens could afford carpets, though.
They were used for many purposes. They covered beds or chests with them, walls were decorated with them and sometimes carpets separated neighbouring rooms.
Stove tiles, covering the floor of rooms, glass windows appeared at wealthy families only in the 15th century, and they were considered luxurious items for a long period of time.
Windows were usually covered by 'lantornas' (dried pellicle of cows), or there were wooden boards in front of them in winter against the cold.
The central room of village houses was the kitchen with an open fire-place. The stove of the rooms was heated from here.
The heating of castles, town houses was a bigger problem. It was quite general that the majority of the rooms were not heated at all.
One of the richest aristocratic families of the country, the Garai family, had two valuable houses in Buda, and only a few of the 50 rooms had a fire-place or stove.
Decorated tile stoves appeared in royal and aristocratic castles or in houses of rich citizens in the middle of the 14th century.
The basic type of stoves had a square fire-place on a stone base with a tower-shaped building on top of it - which usually had an edge. They were covered with tiles or dish-shaped 'stove-eyes'.
The majority of green, yellow or brown tiles were decorated with geometric forms.
Most of the tiles were made after wooden or clay forms (negatives). The most beautiful ones - which were formed as a niche or were trough-shaped - were open tiles with tiny sculptures in the niches. They might have been handmade, independent works of art.
Dishes in the household
The majority of dishes in the household were clay dishes used for cooking or storing.
Clay cauldrons used in the Árpád age disappeared by the 14th century and most of the dishes were planned for open-fire cooking.
Clay dishes were products made by home industry, but according to archaeological findings town pottery became more and more wide-spread, too.
The findings show territorial differences: in the region of Buda white ceramics were popular, while in the eastern and southern territories of the country darker ceramics were preferred. Near the western border the higher-standard grey, later yellow or red ceramics were used.
Under the influence of western import, Hungarian masters also adopted yellow or red ceramics from the 15th century. These ceramics were often covered with lead glaze.
Potters made pots in the greatest number, and pot-lids were also used from the 13th century.
For storing liquids different jugs, jars and bottles were used; and bowls and cups were also used during meals.
The new table-dish, the clay cup and its bigger version, the chalice, appeared in the 14th century.
From the 15th century clay cups were made in various forms, almost each city had its own typical form.
The representative demands of the royal court, aristocracy and wealthy bourgeosie could not be satisfied by home industry for a long time.
From among imported decorative dishes the salt glazed cups of Moravia, Lostice became wide-spread, but Austrian and German clay dishes were also used.
Glass-products were brought in the country by Venetian tradesmen in the 14th century for those who could afford these expensive glasses and bottles.
Since the beginning of the 15th century glass products were made in Hungary, too - first by Italian masters who settled down here - but luxurious dishes were still imported.
Decorative dishes
Besides clothes and jewellery the financial situation of a family was best shown by decorative dishes.
Since glass products were relatively rare, and tin dishes became wide-spread only from the end of the 15th century, in this category mainly silver, or gold-plated silver, or rarely gold dishes were put onto the ceremonial table.
The abundance of gold dishes - which was described in Palatine William Drugeth's testament - was not typical even in aristocratic circles. But as far as possible everybody tried to obtain some.
Among the treasures of Körmend gilded silver dishes were found, and at Kiskunhalas the treasure was hidden in a silver cup which was dropped into water.
