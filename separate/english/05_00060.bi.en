Success for Herend in Frankfurt
Herend has just taken part in the Frankfurt Fair, which is the most important forum for porcelain manufacturers, for the twentieth time.
In keeping with the company's current strategy, the goal of the fair was not aimed at increasing sales.  Their concentration, rather, was on the renewal of its manufactory and the presentation of a new image before the general public.
One of the main symbols of the Herend transformation was the large-scale statue that took centre-stage on the company's stand.  This powerful figure was designed to symbolise the balance between 179 years of traditional craftsmanship and the new, modern direction of the manufactory.
