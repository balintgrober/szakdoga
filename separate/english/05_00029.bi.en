H.: What was your most memorable flight?
R.K.: It was when a Malév crew, under the command of Captain Soma, flew me to the New York premiere of my first film, "Never Fear".
The icing on the cake was when the crew of 9 appeared at the gala premiere the next day.
H.: Where are you flying to next?
R.K.: Probably to Los Angeles for my new film, "World Class".
H. What kind of passenger are you?
R.K.: Despite my agoraphobia, I can be considered a calm traveller.
Even on "bumpier" flights, I don't get scared because I always think of the pilots and hostesses who spend years up in the air.  As a passenger for just a few hours, I'd be ashamed to show my fear.
H.: What do you take on board with you and how do you spend the journey?
R.K.: I'm accompanied on my travels by a lot of newspapers, and sometimes a script or a drama to study.
H.: What's your favourite destination?
R.K.: Nearly all my flights are related to my work in films.
Wherever my films are well received is a nice destination as far as I'm concerned.
H.: Why do you like travelling with MALÉV?
R.K.: For the reasons I mentioned above, and for the extra courtesy shown to me by the staff over the past ten years.
H.: What are your professional plans for the near future?
R.K.: My new film, "World Class", made a successful debut at Christmas time. This film includes Oscar winner, Jirzi Menzel, who is an even greater traveller than me.
In fact, he even honoured the Budapest gala premiere with his presence.
In addition, the first night of the Székesfehérvár Vörösmarty Theatre's performance of Miklós László's play, "Perfumery", will take place in the Thália Theatre on January 12, 2005, and I'm playing the lead role.
