Waste disposal from PHARE money
A few days ago, the Nagykanizsa waste depository was inaugurated and since its technological delivery last December it has been receiving solid waste from the South-Zala town and further sixty neighbouring communities.

Area handout instead of damage evasion
There is a new idea for the clean-up of the Metallochemia-pollution.
