The Tisza Lake
Dense forests on the flood plains, along with golden, sandy banks, backwaters, islands, and tiny inlets.
All of this was created from the damming of the Tisza River, and the result is a lake that is an ideal destination for bathers, anglers, nature lovers and bird watchers.
Boat trips depart from the villages surrounding the lake and visitors can also choose to rent one of the many rowing boats, kayaks and canoes that are standing by at the mooring points.
The lake is also an anglers’ paradise, boasting more than fifty species of fish.
For water sports enthusiasts, the Abádszalók Bay is one of Central Europe’s most popular spots. If you prefer to spend your leisure time on dry land, then check out the riding stables, bicycle routes, craft workshops, healing spas and thermal springs, as well as open-air warm-water pools of varying depths.
The Tisza Lake bird-watching reserve is now home to over 200 species of birds and this area can also be explored by boat.
