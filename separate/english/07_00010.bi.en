The First Habsburg on the Hungarian Throne
Sigismund, German-Roman Emperor, as well as Hungarian and Czech king died without a male successor at the end of 1437.
In his will in 1402 he had appointed Albert IV, Austrian prince, to the Hungarian throne, in the event of his dying without inheritors. After the death of the prince, he named his son Albert V as his successor, so the only daughter of the king, Elisabeth, was married to Albert.
Sigismund had such great authority even after his death that his will was fulfilled.
About two weeks after the king's death the royal council chose Albert to be king. Nobody had been king of Hungary under such a name.
By the middle of the following year Albert I had a large Central-European empire: besides Hungary he controlled the Czech state and Austria. He also became a German-Roman emperor.
The conditions of his election showed that a change had taken place in the political system of Hungary.
Albert had to promise that he would use the revenues of the kingdom only with the approval of the prelates and barons, and he would ask for their opinion when appointing people to the main offices. He was obliged to stop Sigismund's "damaging reforms", among which the confiscation of vacant church incomes was considered to be the most dangerous.
The conditions in the royal council were most favourable for the prelates and the barons. Their main aim was to repress the central royal power established by Sigismund.
In the spring of 1438 King Albert travelled abroad for a year.
Hungarian matters were settled partly by the Queen, who reigned with her husband, and partly by the vicarious, who were members of the royal council appointed to this special post.
Public opinion - which was the opinion of common noblemen at that time - began to change while the king was abroad.
In the summer and autumn of 1438 Turkish armies were able to attack Transylvania without difficulty, destroying first Saxonia, and then the Székelyföld, capturing thousands of prisoners.
Common noblemen blamed the foreign king and his advisers, who were negligent on matters of the country.
In May 1439 the king convoked a parliament in Buda.
While the members were having a meeting there were riots in the town.
German tradesmen, who had a very big influence on the governors of the city and who rented certain incomes of the royal chamber, did not want to share their power with the rich Hungarian citizens, and they had the leader of the riot, a goldsmith, murdered in secret.
After uncovering this plot the houses of Hungarians and Germans were ruined, and their shops were ransacked.
From this time on the Judge of Buda was appointed from among the Hungarians one year, and from among the Germans the following year. Half of the members of the council were Hungarians, and half of them were Germans.
The city of Kolozsvár had a similar system.
The hatred of foreigners also had an influence on the laws enacted at the sessions of parliament.
Laws banned the employment of foreigners in offices, and they could not derive an income from the country either.
The conditions for elections were also changed: from that time on common noblemen could interfere with affairs of state.
The defence of the country and its borders became the responsibility of the king, and Hungarian noblemen were not obliged to cover the costs of the defence.
They reconfirmed the act of the Golden Bull, so that noblemen could not be forced to take part in wars outside the country.
With these laws a new political system was formed in Hungary: the common power of the estates and the king. This was called the system of estates.
Albert was able to accept these modifications easily, since in Austria he had already been governing in co-operation with the estates for a long time.
After the session of parliament the king marched to the southern borders against the Turks.
As troops were difficult to gather the only thing they could do was to prevent further Turkish attacks.
However, they could not prevent the siege of Szendrõ, the residence of the Serbian despot, and then when there was an epidemic of dysentery they withdrew.
The king was also infected with dysentery, and he died in October.
At that time the queen was already pregnant.
When he was dying, Albert had his will noted down.
If his baby was to be a boy, his guardian would be Elisabeth and the eldest member of the Habsburg dynasty.
He wished to entrust a joint council with governing the country, and the revenues would be common, too.
His will was not fulfilled, joint governing and common revenues remained impossible to attain in the Habsburg countries even centuries later.
Troublesome times and Ladislaus V's Reign
The Hungarian estates chose the 15-year old energetic person, member of the Jagello dynasty Ulaslo to be Hungarian king.
Queen Elisabeth had the Holy Crown stolen from the fortress of Visegrád then she had her six-week old new-born child, Ladislaus V, crowned, who was born after his father's death.
The coronation ceremony met all the three requirements of Hungarian customary law: it was performed with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár, and with the participation of the Archbishop of Esztergom.
When Ulaslo I arrived in Hungary the queen and her escort escaped to western Hungary, and the young king had himself crowned with the crown of Saint Stephen's head relic holder.
The country was divided into two parts: Elisabeth and the baby king ruling one part and the followers of Ulaslo I ruling the other.
The following 15 years was a troublesome period.
During this time there was a civil war in Hungary - except for the armistices for the winter months.
The violent occupations of lands were political actions, so whole estates changed hands for long periods or sometimes permanently.
Laws declared that the occupied lands be returned but they were not enforced.
The queen brought in Czech mercenary troops to Upper Hungary under the command of Jan Giskra. They served her for roughly two decades.
The queen authorised Giskra to use the revenues of the local mines, to impose taxes, and to occupy the royal castles and fortresses of Ulaslo's supporters.
The other significant base of the Habsburg party was Slavonia, where Ulrich Cillei was in power.
At the beginning of 1441 Ulaslo occupied Transdanubia.
An influential political figure, John Hunyadi, appeared at that time, who drove out the followers of Elisabeth from this region with the help of Nicholas Újlaki.
In her hopeless situation, Elisabeth gave the crown and her child to Prince Fridrich, who was meanwhile chosen to be German-Roman king.
Újlaki and the ambitious John Hunyadi, an associate of his family, became Transylvanian voivodes together in February 1441, so Ulaslo I's power also ended there.
The king was engaged in fighting the Turks and with domestic problems.
He exercised his power together with the estates, and it was only in the last year of his reign, that he tried to restore his lost royal power.
His plans failed, since he died in the battle of Várna.
In Hungary months after the battle of Várna people still expected King Ulaslo I to return.
The state council was responsible for governing the country in 1445, and domestic peace was maintained by the seven chief captains, among whom there were also some followers of the Habsburgs.
The Hungarian estates could only accept Ladislaus V as their king on condition that Fridrich III gave them the child and the Holy Crown, but Fridrich refused.
The civil war continued.
At Whitsun 1446 Hungarian dignitaries, the majority of whom used to be followers of Ulaslo, elected John Hunyadi as governor, till Ladislaus V became of age.
Giskra and Cillei did not turn up at the election of the governor.
Military action against them was not very successful, and the country was engaged in war with Fridrich III, too.
Barons united in so called leagues to protect their families and estates.
Austria, the Czech state and Hungary were formally united in a personal union, under the reign of Ladislaus V.
As a result of the joint action of the estates of the three countries Fridrich III set the young king free in 1452 and handed him over to Ulrich Cillei, but he did not return the crown.
In January 1453 John Hunyadi resigned, but he kept the royal castles he was in charge of as chief captain of the country.
Domestic conflicts ended, but the barons wanted to keep their power and estates gained in those troublesome times. The rivalry of Hunyadi and Cillei continued.
When John Hunyadi died after the victory at Nándorfehérvár, Cillei became the chief captain of the country.
Ladislaus V claimed his royal castles back, which were still in the possession of the Hunyadi family.
However, the leader of the family, Ladislaus Hunyadi, did not want to return them. He had Cillei murdered by his associates in the presence of the king, when he came to Nándorfehérvár to negotiate. He appointed himself to the post of chief captain of the country.
In the spring of 1457 the king had Ladislaus Hunyadi, his younger brother, Matthias and several of their associates captured.
Ladislaus was executed for high treason.
But the power of the Hunyadis was not broken.
The widow of the governor, Elisabeth Szilágyi and her brother-in-law, Michael Szilágyi, did not give up, so the civil war started again.
Ladislaus V took Matthias with him to Prague as a prisoner.
As the military campaign against the Hunyadis was unsuccessful the dignitaries started to negotiate, and this process was accelerated by Ladislaus's death.
The death of the king, who did not have a successor, put an end to the first reign of the Habsburg dynasty in Hungary.
Matthias Hunyadi
In 1458 Matthias Hunyadi was about 15 years old.
His followers started to negotiate with the Czech governor and the Hungarian dignitaries so that they would accept Matthias as the Hungarian king.
During these separate negotiations they agreed to two marriages: according to one version Matthias would marry Anna, the daughter of the most powerful baron, palatine Ladislaus Garai, and according to the other version he would marry Katharine, daughter of George Podjebrád.
Under the pressure of the Hunyadi party, which was led by Szilágyi, the parliament in Pest chose Matthias to be king, and assigned Michael Szilágyi to him as a governor for five years.
The acts of the parliament, which elected Matthias king, showed the interests of the estates that had become very powerful during those troublesome times.
Returning home, the elected king got engaged to Katharine Podjebrád at the border, then in the first year of his reign he appointed different people to important positions: Ladislaus Garai was replaced by Michael Ország Guti in the position of palatine, and remained palatine until his death.
Michael Szilágyi resigned, then when he entered the league with Garai and Újlaki against the king, he was sent to prison.
The dignitaries deprived of their power, a total of 25, elected Emperor Fridrich III to be Hungarian king at Németújvár on 17 February, 1459.
Matthias had already been privy to this plot, so he asked for a petition of loyalty from the majority of the Hungarian barons and prelates a week before Fridrich's election. Then he won a military victory over the plotters.
The emperor's election to be Hungarian king did not threaten Hunyadi's royal power, but it became important from the point of view of future events.
From this time on Fridrich carried the title Hungarian king and this election was the basis of the claims by the Habsburg dynasty for the Hungarian throne at a later time.
The first phase of Matthias's reign lasted until the coronation in 1464.
Then his main aims were to recover the prerequisite of his authorised power the Holy Crown to force Fridrich to give up his claim to the Hungarian throne, and to consolidate his power over the whole country.
He initiated military campaigns against Fridrich; and in the summer of 1461 Czech power in Upper Hungary was broken first under the command of the king, and later under Emerick Szapolyai. It was finished by Giskra's surrender in the spring of 1462.
Fridrich III and King Matthias made peace in 1463 at Bécsújhely.
Fridrich gave back the Holy Crown and the town of Sopron to Matthias for 80,000 Forints, adopting him as his son, and promising to help in the military campaigns against the Turks.
The emperor kept some fortresses along the border, and he was permitted to use his title King of Hungary.
In the event of Matthias dying without a male successor, Fridrich's descendants would inherit the Hungarian throne.
The coronation ceremony was not held until 1464 because of the Bosnian campaign.
The universal reform of the state administration started right after the coronation.
There was a revolt in Transylvania in 1467 because of the new taxation system.
Matthias put down this revolt, but he had mercy on the ringleaders. However, several participants, common noblemen, died in this conflict.
The Hussite George Podjebrád was deprived of the throne, and this was declared by the Pope in 1466.
Matthias thought it was time to unite several countries under his reign.
In 1468 he declared war on Victor Podjebrád in Austria, who was the son of the Czech king.
Of the countries under Czech rule, Moravia, Silesia and Lausitz remained Catholic. The local estates and the Czech Catholic minority offered the Czech crown to Matthias.
In 1569 he was elected Czech king in the Moravian Olmüc, and wore the title Czech king until his death.
Matthias reigned over two thirds of the countries of the Czech crown, but he could never conquer the Czech state.
The relationship with the Poles became quite hostile owing to the Czech problem.
When George Podjebrád died in 1471, the Czech estates chose a new king; Ulaslo, son of the Polish king, Casimir IV.
The Jagello dynasty voiced their claim to the Hungarian throne in the very same year.
In the absence of the king several Hungarian noblemen participated in a plot against Matthias, under the leadership of John Vitéz, the Archbishop of Esztergom, who was a loyal supporter of the Hunyadi family.
According to contemporaries there were a lot of reasons for the plot: excluding noblemen from government, high taxes, restraints upon church revenues.
The plotters offered the Hungarian crown to Prince Casimir, the Polish king's son.
Just as in 1459, Matthias first requested a guarantee of loyalty from his supporters, and only then prepared for the defence of the country.
Casimir's Polish troops suffered a defeat in Hungary.
John Vitéz died in captivity, Janus Pannonius, the Bishop of Pécs, died while escaping.
Most participants of the plot received a pardon, and Michael Újlaki, who was loyal this time, became king of Bosnia.
Peace was made with the Poles only in 1474, but it did not last long: a war broke out for the possession of Silesia.
There was another war with Fridrich III for the Czech kingdom, which was also the vassal of the German-Roman Empire.
Emperor Fridrich initiated Ulaslo as Czech king in 1477, but after the success of Hungarian military troops, he gave the Czech tenure to Matthias in the same year.
However, this fact had no practical consequence, as none of the dignitaries were invited to the political meetings of the empire.
Ulaslo and Matthias made peace in Olmüc in 1479: both of them were allowed to bear the title Czech king, but Moravia, Silesia and Lausitz belonged to Matthias until his death. After that these regions came under the authority of Ulaslo.
Upon normalising his relations with the Jagellos, Matthias turned against the Habsburgs.
His aim was to conquer Austria and Styria.
With the occupation of Vienna in 1485, Matthias possessed almost the whole of Lower-Austria, and from 1487 he used the title Prince of Austria.
He gave small favours to the estates at the parliament in 1485 in Hungary, and he made his centralised power stronger with the help of his juristic reforms.
During the reign of Albert I, Ulaslo, Ladislaus V and Matthias the Hungarian king ruled in other countries, too.
However, they had no real empires in the modern sense of the word, the individual countries being governed separately, which also served the interest of the local estates.
Matthias, who had a centralising policy in Hungary, adopted a very compliant attitude in regard to the estates in Austria and Moravia, while in Silesia he was a very strict ruler.
The Hunyadi family could not found a dynasty.
In 1474 Matthias married Beatrix of Aragonia, daughter of the King of Naples, through his representatives.
They did not have any children, so the king spent his last years ensuring the succession of his illegitimate child, John Corvin, who was brought up at the court.
He received the huge Hunyadi estate, and inherited the revenues of the estates of the king. Matthias's supporters were in the leading positions, for example, in charge of the fortresses.
John Corvin received the title Prince of Lipto in addition to the Hunyadi countship.
The Jagello Age
Matthias could not assert the prince's right to the throne in a diplomatic way, so when he was dying he made Hungarian noblemen swear that they would support John Corvin in his succession.
In May 1490 a group of 9,000-10,000 noblemen gathered in the Rákos-mezõ [Rákos field] to elect a new king, and the representatives of towns also appeared, after 15 years of passivity.
There were four candidates for the Hungarian throne: John Corvin, Maximilian - German-Roman King, and two brothers from the Jagello family - Ulaslo, the Czech king, and his brother Prince John Albert.
They had to be able to do two things: first they broke up with Matthias's domestic policy, then they had to enter into alliance with another country to ensure Hungary's defence from the Turks.
Maximilian, who also became ruler of Tyrol in those months, referred to the 1463 succession contract.
He did not have many supporters, since the Hungarian estates saw him as the representative of the defeated Austria, nor did they like the fact that he based his claims to the throne on the right of succession, in contrast with their own right to choose a king. The estates were afraid that his western interests would be more important for him.
John Albert was popular with the common noblemen because of his military successes over the Tartars. He was also supported by his father, Casimir IV, King of Poland.
Common noblemen proclaimed John Albert king, but they did not wait until the end of the parliament, most of them returned home for the harvest.
The Ulaslo party suppressed John Corvin with the aid of military troops.
The escort of the prince, who was marching with the treasury southwards to his followers, was defeated by Paul Kinizsi and Stephen Báthori, Transylvanian voivodes at the Csont field in county Tolna.
Ulaslo accepted the conditions of the election at Farkashida in county Pozsony, near the Moravian border.
He promised he would put an end to Matthias's damaging reforms and the collection of the 1 Forint tax.
These conditions were not much different from those accepted by Albert or Matthias, and they met the general expectations of the European system of estates. Ulaslo however, kept most of his promises.
Ulaslo II came to an agreement with Corvin, but the other two pretenders caused a lot of trouble for him during the first two years of his reign.
John Albert's Polish troops took over Eperjes and sieged Kassa.
By the end of autumn Hungarian reign ended in Austria, Styria and Carinthia. Maximilian sieged Transdanubia and occupied Székesfehérvár in November 1490.
At the end of the year Ulaslo started his campaign to take over the country.
First he forced his brother out of the country, who then returned once more in the second half of 1491, only to suffer a defeat.
Maximilian's mercenary troops disbarded and they gave up Székesfehérvár in the summer of 1491.
Ulaslo even had time to attack the Turks in Bosnia.
To ensure his reign he made peace with Maximilian in Pozsony in November.
The treaty they made was a renewal of the 1463 contract. Maximilian was allowed to keep the title King of Hungary, and the barons of the country took an oath to accept his right of succession.
The peace treaty of Pozsony declared should Ulaslo die without a legitimate male successor, Hungary and the Czech state would fall to the Habsburgs; in addition to this Ulaslo had to return the Austrian fortresses.
Following this Ulaslo enjoyed some peaceful years of rule.
If the king stayed in the Czech state, the country was governed by the palatines as governors.
The estates were allowed to intervene in governing, and it became a general rule.
From 1498 permanent assessors were elected to the royal council from among common noblemen. As far as finance was concerned (which was under the king's authority), they tried to separate royal and national revenues, and sometimes a separate treasurer was appointed from among the estates alongside the royal treasurer.
The Jagellos continued Matthias's policy regarding the Turks.
Except for some short periods, there was peace from 1495 to 1520.
In fact, however, there was a permanent war along the southern border, which gradually weakened the most developed region of medieval Hungary, Sermia.
Ulaslo's problem of succession started when he had two children from his marriage to Anna of Candale: Anna and Louis.
The main concern of common noblemen was national policy.
Before Louis's birth, at the 1505 parliament they declared that if Ulaslo were to die without a male heir, they would elect a Hungarian king.
The declaration of the idea of a national kingdom was against the Habsburgs.
Ulaslo did not assert the resolution, which was later called the "Rákos resolution", but rather he invalidated it when he made a Habsburg-Jagello succession treaty with Maximilian in 1506.
In accordance with this contract, if he had a son he would marry Maximilian's granddaughter, Maria, and his daughter would be married to the other grandson Ferdinand.
As Ulaslo II had had a stroke earlier, they declared that if he died, the guardian of his children would be Maximilian, and in the event of him dying without a male heir, the Habsburgs would inherit the throne.
In 1515 in Vienna Sigismund I, the Polish king, Ulaslo II and Maximilian confirmed this treaty, so Louis's guardian became Maximilian and Sigismund. After a few days they held the double engagement ceremony in the Stephansdom in Vienna.
The biggest peasant revolt of Hungarian history led by György Dózsa took place in 1514.
In the previous year Pope Leo X had started a crusade against the Turks.
The papal representative, legate of the campaign was Cardinal Thomas Bakócz.
The Observant Franciscans were in charge of the organisation of the crusade. When this crusade turned into a peasant war, they provided the ideology.
Mainly villeins gathered in the military camps and their leader was the Székely George Dózsa.
When the gathering troops started to plunder, recruiting was stopped in May, and the crusade was cancelled.
The crusaders formed an independent group, the main army - under the command of Dózsa - killed the Bishop of Csanád, took over Lippa, and then laid siege to Temesvár.
The king began to gather an army to fight against the rebels only at the beginning of June.
Troops around Pest and in county Heves were defeated at the end of June.
Dózsa's army was defeated at Temesvár by John Szapolyai, a Transylvanian voivode.
George Dózsa and the captured leaders were executed, but the majority of the crusaders managed to return home unharmed.
The punishment of the villeins who had taken part in murdering and plundering was prevented by their landlords.
The peasant war did not spread to the whole country.
The peasants of Transdanubia, Upper Hungary and the greater part of Transylvania, and Slavonia did not take part in the conflicts.
Neither did the people of the market towns of the Great Plain, who lived from breeding cattle.
The direct reason for the outbreak of the Hungarian peasant war did not have its origin in the social situation or the crisis in trade, but could rather be attributed to the fact that the armed crusaders believed that noblemen did not defend the country and its villeins.
Owing to similar reasons there was a peasant revolt in Central-Austria in 1478.
Ulaslo II was followed on the throne by his son, the ten-year old Louis II.
During his reign the estate system strengthened, and the Turkish threat became bigger.
Common noblemen left the 1518 parliament at Rákosmezõ and formed an independent parliament in Tolna.
Their leader Stephen Werbõczy, demanded a campaign against the Turks from the king.
However, in 1519 they made peace with the Turks, for three years, and for the last time.
In 1520 a new sultan mounted the throne of the Osman Empire: Suleyman the Great.
When the minister, Chaus Behram, sent to Buda to prolong the peace treaty was captured and sent to prison, an attack against Hungary was started.
The Hungarians were defeated at Nándorfehérvár in 1521.
Louis II wanted first to solve his domestic problems.
In 1523 he wanted to strengthen his royal power in both of his countries: Hungary and the Czech state. His attempts failed.
The idea of an international alliance against the Turks was not realised, either. Poland made peace with the Osman Empire in 1525, and the German and Venetian ministers left the country at the request of the common noblemen, who were against foreigners.
Only the Pope gave financial help to Hungary.
The sultan's army, which attacked the country in 1526, defeated the royal army at the battle of Mohács, and Louis II also died in the battlefield.
MILITARY HISTORY
The Armed Forces
The organisation of the army was totally changed in the 15th century.
The military role of noblemen was pushed back, the old forms of recruitment in Hungary, such as the general declaration of war, when all noblemen were liable to military service, no longer applied.
The Hungarian army of the time was divided into three main parts: the royal, the baron-prelate and the county banderies.
After Sigismund's reforms it was king Matthias who first reorganised the army.
The secular and ecclesiastic dignities who presented their own banderies were called barons.
From 1498 they were the ones who collected half of the military tax, which they spent on equipment for their own armies, and the other half of the tax was the king's income.
Most of the baron and county armies were the estate armies.
If there was a general declaration of war, noblemen joined the county banderies.
The modern army of the age contained permanent mercenary troops.
In Hungary it was introduced by Matthias Hunyadi in the middle of the 1460s.
First it was founded when Giskra and his warriors changed sides, but it became more important during the Czech wars, when mercenary commander, Frantisek Hag organised a permanent mercenary army for the king's service, which consisted of about 6-8,000 soldiers.
The majority of these soldiers were Czech or Polish.
After Matthias's death, part of the mercenary army became known as the black army. It derived its name from one of the mercenary commanders, the "black" Haugwitz.
These mercenary armies were employed mainly in the western battlefields.
Ulaslo II also employed them against Miksa and John Albert, but when they had no war to fight and no job and money was provided, they started to plunder.
They were sent to the southern border, where they plundered the land instead of fighting the Turks.
In 1492 they were put down by Paul Kinizsi, those who survived were sent to Austria.
Some mercenary soldiers were still to be found in the Hungarian army during the reign of the Jagellos, but there was no need to employ them in great numbers on a regular basis.
When Matthias started his second campaign against Austria the age of war for its own sake started in Hungary.
Besides general reasons to conquer, the main aim was to keep the army prepared for war, and the conquered land could sustain the army.
Hungary lived in peace with its northern and western neighbours during the reign of the Jagellos.
It had peaceful relations with the Czech state because of the common ruler. In Poland they had kinship with the ruling dynasty, and the country could also maintain peace with the Habsburg provinces because of the dynastic contracts - except for the short military preparation in 1506.
There were 5 different branches of service in the army.
The light cavalry played an important role in the wars with the Turks.
Most of the hussars, who served in the light cavalry earlier, were of southern-Slav origin.
The heavy cavalry was employed in open battlefields.
The infantry had a defensive role, they hardly ever used the wagon-fortress tactic, which was the favourite tactic of the Hussites.
The importance of the artillery had slowly increased, at the beginning of the age siege machines were more useful than cannons.
The task of sloopers - that is soldiers on ships - was to defend the lower part of the Danube.
The Turkish Wars
King Sigismund changed the political-military system of the defence against the Turks in the 1420s.
Up to that time buffer states (Havasalföld, Serbia, Bosnia) defended Hungary and Croatia from the Osmans, but then this became the task of the border fortresses.
During the reign of Matthias the double line of the border fortress system was built, which survived until 1521.
The outer line started at Szörény, Orsova and went through Nándorfehérvár, Szabács, the ban district of Srebernik, Banja Luka, Jajca, Knin, the Klissa line to Scardona, while the inner line started at Temesvár, went through Karánsebes, Lugos, Sermia, Dubica, Kruppa, Otocsác, Bihács to Zengg.
Serbia was first taken over by the Osman Empire in 1439.
Although George Brankovics got his country back in 1444, the Turks reoccupied South Serbia in 1455, and the residence of the despot, Szendrõ, was also occupied by 1459.
In 1439 the Turks attacked Krassó and Keve counties as well as Transylvania, taking advantage of the internal troubles in the country.
The Hungarians started to fight back only in 1442, when the Osman army was engaged in conflicts in Karamania.
The so-called winter or long campaign, led by John Hunyadi in 1443-1444, then the 1444 (starting with the battle of Várna and finishing with the 1448 battle of Rigómezõ) campaign were not very successful.
After Hunyadi's long campaign the Pope, Ulaslo I, the Prince of Burgundy, Venice and Geneva started a common war against the Turks.
The main aim was to put an end to Osman reign in the Balkans.
According to the military plans the galleys of the sea powers would have defended the Dardanellas, and the land army would have attacked the Osman troops in Europe (Rumelia), which would have their line of retreat cut off.
The sea battle was unsuccessful, Sultan Murad crossed the strait from Asia, united his armies in Anatolia and Rumelia, and defeated the Hungarian-Polish-Havasalföld armies at Várna on November 1, 1444.
Although Serbia became a Turkish vassal state for only a short time, the Hungarian positions in the Balkans could not be regained.
When in 1456 Sultan Mehmed II wanted to occupy Serbia, he planned to conquer Nándorfehérvár as well.
Since the fall of Byzantium in 1453 a crusade against the Turks had been organized on the Pope's initiative. In Hungary it was organised by John Kapisztrán.
The Pope ordered that the bells be rung at noon as a prayer for the success of the crusaders.
The victory at Nándorfehérvár was John Hunyadi's greatest victory: this was the only occasion, when the army of the medieval Hungarian Kingdom defeated the sultan's army.
Independent Bosnia fell in 1463.
After the sultan's army had left, Matthias personally led a campaign to the freshly surrendered province in the winter of the very same year.
He took over Jajca, Kljuc and Banja Luka.
Then Bosnia, divided between the Turks and Hungary, became a means of defence as part of the border fortress system, rather than a buffer state.
Nicholas Újlaki's Bosnian kingdom did not become a real country, the Bosnian bans did not become barons, they remained simple military commanders.
Jajca was kept under the authority of Hungary till 1527, but in the final years supplying this region could only be undertaken through real campaigns.
Focus on the West: the Czech and Austrian Wars
The war against the countries of the Czech kingdom started in 1468.
In the first year Matthias occupied Moravia, and in the next year a great part of Silesia.
But this time it turned out that there was a chance of a very long war; the Czech defeated the Hungarian army at the Moravian Magyarbród.
In the year 1470 there were campaigns of varying success.
Podjebrád created problems in Matthias's provinces, while the Hungarian king tried to occupy the Czech silver mines - albeit without success.
The campaign turned into an expensive war, which contributed to the 1471 Hungarian plot.
The war was resumed in 1474, when Frederick III and Ulaslo, the Czech king, formed an alliance against Matthias. This alliance was also joined by the Poles, although it was only a month after the peace treaty signed in Ófalu.
In Silesia military events took place in the autumn.
Matthias had the reserves transported to the strengthened fortresses and towns away from the Czech-Polish troops, and his mercenaries harried the enemy.
The Hungarian king went to Boroszló (today Wroclaw), and declared his engagement to Beatrix during the siege of the town.
The attacking soldiers took a lot of captives, and the warriors attacking the town, who did not have enough food, asked for a truce from the ones they were fighting against. It was a very strange event in military history.
The Austrian campaign, started in 1482, was fought mainly by mercenaries.
They fought for the occupation of certain fortresses, which were very difficult to take over one by one.
The first two years of the war were limited to Lower-Austria, the estates of Carinthia having already signed a separate peace treaty with Matthias in 1482.
In 1483 the Hungarian army took over Klosterneuburg near Vienna, and the emperor escaped to Graz, which seemed to be a safer place.
In the next year they devastated Styria and Carinthia, but the main battlefield remained Lower-Austria.
The blockade around the city of Vienna was complete in January 1484.
The defenders' ambitious struggle was in vain, as the hungry city capitulated after a siege of several months.
Matthias marched into the capital city on June 1, 1485, accepting the praise of the Austrian estates there, and ruling his new province from here.
However, the war did not end, as Bécsújhely surrendered to the Hungarians only in 1487.
After this the Austrian campaign was practically over.
War Against the Turks
From the middle of the 1460s till 1521 there were hardly any open conflicts with the Turks.
Peace practically meant static warfare.
The last western buffer state on the Balkans fell with the occupation of Hercegovina.
No army of the sultan attacked the country, only the neighbouring beys led some military actions.
As there was a long distance between the neighbouring border fortresses, the Turkish troops attacked Hungary many times.
In 1474 and 1490 they reached Várad, in 1479 they devastated Transylvania.
During this attack they suffered a defeat at the battle of Kenyérmezõ, then in 1480 Matthias led a three-front campaign of revenge to the Havasalföld, Serbia and Bosnia.
Matthias also used the Osman campaigns against Fridrich III.
In the 1470-80s he allowed Turkish troops making incursions in Inner-Austria to pass through the country.
So the Habsburgs claimed in the Jagello age that they also should be included in the Hungarian-Turkish peace.
There was already a crisis in the Croatian border defence in the last decades of the 15th century, so in the 1493 battle of Udbinja the Croatian troops suffered serious defeats.
The Havasalföld managed to retain its independence, since it played no role in supporting the expansion of the Osman Empire.
However, the voivodes of the Havasalföld paid taxes to the Turks from the end of the 14th century.
Sometimes they surrendered to the Hungarian king, or entered into an alliance with him, but such events were limited to a very short period.
Moldavia, which was under the influence of Poland, resisted the Turks for a longer time, but after the death of Chief Prince Stephen Nagy also submitted to the Osmans.
In 1520 Hungary did not want to enter a war, but its unfriendly movements were considered reasons for war by Emperor Suleyman.
Because of the devastation on the southern regions the Hungarians saw war as a better alternative to a demolishing peace.
The army of the sultan attacked Hungary in June 1521.
They also occupied Szabács and Zimony.
After a 66-day siege Nándorfehérvár also capitulated.
After taking control of the fortress the sultan left for home.
Local forces widened the wedge at this front, too, having occupied Orsova, Szörény, Tinin and Scardona in the west.
After 1521 the Hungarian Kingdom could not defend the country by itself.
Sermia was demolished in a couple of years in continuous fights.
Territories in the north were defended by the Danube and the second defence line of fortresses.
Since 1522 the Habsburgs sent regular military and financial help to Croatia, and this contributed to the fact that after the battle of Mohács the Croatian estates chose Ferdinand as their king, and later they were more loyal to the Habsburg rulers than to the Hungarians.
In 1526 the army of the sultan started a war against Hungary, their aim being to defeat the Hungarian royal army.
The Hungarian troops gathered at Tolna, and the Czech mercenaries financed by the Pope also went there.
The commander of the army was Paul Tomori, Archbishop of Kalocsa, who had earlier commanded the defence of the southern regions, and George Szapolyai.
Voivode John Szapolyai's Transylvanian troops and Christopher Frangepán's Croatian troops did not arrive.
The Turks occupied Pétervárad, and Újlak, setting up a bridge at Eszék and crossing the river Dráva.
The battle took place at Mohács on 29 August, 1526.
The Hungarian army suffered a catastrophic defeat.
SOCIETY
The Inhabitants of the Country
In Hungary, as in Western Europe, social classes or groups were called estates.
The estate was the community of people with the same rights, but there could be a tremendous difference within an estate in regard to the wealth of the members.
Belonging to an estate was defined by birth (the only exception was the church estate), so the possibility of changing one's social status was slight.
The privileges of social groups were called liberties, for example, the liberty of the nobility.
The end of the Middle Ages was the age of social stability, the walls between the estates consolidated and in some cases they remained unchanged until 1848.
There are no exact data concerning the population of the country in this period - similarly to earlier periods, figures can only be estimated.
In 1494-1495 Sigismund Ernuszt compiled the statistics of the treasury on the revenues and expenditures of the state.
Based on this source, the population could have been around three or possibly even five million.
According to the most probable estimate the population (including Transylvania and Slavonia) was about 4-4.5 million.
Any changes in the population level are even more difficult to define, there may have been a very gradual growth, or sometimes stagnation.
In this period there were no serious epidemics or famines in Hungary, which would have caused significant demographical changes.
There are different data about households: in the 1520s in a village in county Hont there were 7.6, and some decades later in a village in county Sopron there were 6.3, and in today's market town of Szigetvár there were 13 persons living together in one household on average.
Servants were also included in these numbers.
The Nobility
On top of the secular hierarchy were the barons.
At the beginning of the age this concept referred only to office holders at the royal court, but after some decades it became the term for a social group to which one could primarily belong by birth.
Sons of barons had usually become barons earlier too, and they inherited their fathers' estates, however, they could not bear the title until they received an office.
In the Jagello age the real barons of the country - who were holders of the most important offices - were distinguished from natural barons, or as they were called then 'barons' sons' or 'magnates'.
In 1498 there was a law that listed the noblemen (barons) by their names who were obliged to set up a bandery.
The magnates who were not included in this elite group on the basis of their wealth were practically discluded from the aristocracy.
Up to that time aristocrats were barons, the title marquis was used only by a few families of German and Croatian origin.
From that time on, however, titles bestowed for political deserts or merits, such as John Hunyadi's, then Michael Szilágyi's (from Beszterce) and the Szapolyai family's (from Szepes) 'marquis' title, became highly respected and the Hungarian marquis title was born.
The real barons of the country were the palatine, the chief judge of the country, the Slavonian and Dalmatian-Croatian ban, the Transylvanian voivode, the Székely ispán (bailiff), the ban of Macsó and Szörény, the main office holders of the royal court and the ispán (bailiff) of Pozsony and Temes.
The rights of barons differed from general noble rights in four respects.
They entered a war at the head of their own bandery, their oath was worth ten times that of other noblemen, but one hundred noblemen's oaths were needed to take an oath against them, and their widows were due to receive a sum of one hundred marks.
In this period common noblemen were also called noblemen.
There were big differences between the wealth of noblemen with estates.
Barons owning a fortress and the surrounding villages, noblemen engaged in trade, as well as lower noblemen owning only two or three villein families all belonged to the very same social group.
The members of the higher layer of estate owners were called "well-off noblemen" by their contemporaries, and this category was used without numerical limitations.
Their votes were the casting ones in matters of the county, their opinions were very important at the meeting of the parliament, and they had a great influence on common noblemen when they were taking up positions.
The majority of noblemen were noblemen owning only one small estate and no more. However, they owned that estate by their noble rights, just as barons owned their estates, which were sometimes as big as half of the county.
Since the time King Matthias's tax reform was enacted noblemen with only one smaller estate also had to pay tax, though they often objected to this, and their taxes were not always regular.
Most of these noblemen lived like peasants, with no obligation to take part in parliamentary meetings personally, and with only a very minor political influence in matters of the state.
Common noblemen often referred to the very same noble liberties, by which they meant that all noblemen of the country had the same rights.
Werbõczy's Triple book summarised this concept in four points.
1. They could not be arrested without previous summoning and legal sentence - except in the event of being caught in the act.
2. They were subject only to a legally crowned king.
3. They could freely exercise their legal rights, or use the revenues of their estates; they did not have to pay any taxes or customs duties, their only obligation was to defend the country in the event of war.
4. If a king acted against any of their rights, they could rebel without being accused of disloyalty.
At the beginning of the age the institution of 'familiares' was flourishing.
Barons and rich noblemen employed noblemen in their families in return for accommodation and board.
The relationship between the lord and his familiare became looser by the end of the Middle Ages, and noblemen were employed for only a very short time, for example, one year.
The expression 'servitor' appeared in the Jagello age and referred to noblemen in service.
There were big differences among noblemen in service too: the income of the chief officer in a fortress could be as much as that of a noblemen with an average-size estate, but there were people who worked merely for food, accommodation and clothes.
Villeins
The majority of the population of the country belonged to the group of villeins.
The merging, which had started at the beginning of the previous century, was completed by the 15th century.
Then everybody was considered a villein who was subject to the authority of a landlord, no matter if he was a person renting several waste areas or a burgher of a market town keeping a whole flock of sheep or a cottar living in the house of another person.
Villeins did not own their lands, although their sons could inherit it under certain legal conditions.
They came under the legal authority of the landlord: and their cases were judged at the local court, the landlords being obliged to see to their defence.
After the peasant revolt of 1514 was put down, the free movement of the villeins was prohibited by law, though it was not put into practice.
For centuries the relationship between the landlord and villein was determined primarily by local customary law - and not by enacted laws.
The allowances paid to the landlord were also determined by local customary law, which was often recorded in writing, in the so-called urbariums.
Regular revenues, gifts given twice or three times a year and the rent for the land (terragium) recorded in the urbariums were not very high, but these were supplemented by the 'irregular task', which was quite regularly collected in some estates.
A ninth was not paid everywhere, the amount of robot was slight, and it usually included cartage and hay making.
The Burghers
The layer of burghers - just like other estates - was not a unified group.
The upper layer of the population of bigger towns were tradesmen, renters of royal chambers, and tradesman artisans; in mining towns they were the owners of mines and smelting-furnaces.
They controlled the town, and the members of the so-called 'inner council' were elected from among them.
Artisans were the middle layer in towns, they interfered in the governing of the city through the outer council.
The majority of city people were called city-dwellers. Although they were considered burghers outside the town walls, the leaders of the city did not accept them as real burghers.
They worked as day-wage men or transporters, or performed other services.
According to general law the dwellers of market towns were villeins, but they were usually called burghers, like those who lived in bishopric centres.
In the 15th century there were also several new guilds in the market towns.
Usually all the craftsmen joined a common guild.
At that time there was no difference between guilds and religious associations.
Such associations set up their own altar, and their meetings were the scenes of political life in the city.
Christ's body guilds of bigger cities were associations of rich tradesmen, but there was also a separate guild for those who were very poor.
ECONOMY
State finance was an unknown concept in the Middle Ages.
King Matthias was the first ruler who made an attempt to separate royal and state incomes. The estates had the right to intervene in how state incomes were spent.
There are no exact data on all the incomes and expenditures on the central account, not even after the reform of the treasury.
The budget of the late medieval Hungarian kingdom, like those of other European countries, was in the red, and there was a continual shortage of money.
There were two distinct periods in the finances of the age: the one before and the one after King Matthias's reforms.
In the first period the income of the state was lower than in the Sigismund age, which can be explained by the chaotic political situation.
Most of the income came from the salt monopoly, the money reform, the thirtieths and finally from the exchange of precious metals.
King Albert introduced the system of regular money reform.
After his death there were chaotic conditions in money minting: money being minted in the name of several rulers at the same time.
Although the golden forint was able to keep its value, the silver money used in everyday life was devalued.
The initiator of the financial reform carried out between 1464 and 1470 was John Ernuszt.
There were four main innovations.
Money reform was cancelled, as a lot of landowners were exempted from paying the tax known as the profit of the chamber. It was cancelled, but a new tax of the same value was introduced in the same year under a new name: royal fiscus.
The name of the thirtieth customs duty was changed into crown customs duty.
There were innovations in money minting, too, and finally the structure of financial control. The treasury was also changed.
After the reform the income from taxes became the number one income of the state, exceeding all others.
There were two kinds of taxes: 1/5 golden forint treasury tax per house, and an extraordinary tax of 1 forint per house.
The latter was imposed at the beginning of King Matthias's reign, and then collected more often, almost every year during the Czech wars.
The Jagellos did not change this system, although they made promises.
The cities, the Jews, the Rumanians and Székelys paid tax separately.
King Matthias's income amounted to about 900,000 golden forints in the best financial years.
At this time Venice had an income of about one million golden forints, the Osman Empire 1,800,000, and the French Kingdom 4,000,700.
Before the reform three kinds of money were minted: the golden forint and two kinds of silver coins, the denarius and the obulus.
After 1467 the minting of the groat was reintroduced.
At that time 1 golden forint was worth 100 denariuses, 1 groat was worth 4 denariuses, and 1 denarius was worth 2 obuluses.
During the reign of Ulaslo II a new valuable silver coin was minted, which was called guldiner, and later thaler, but it was still not used in everyday life.
The appearance of different coins also changed. Coins with the picture of a madonna appeared, which were minted for centuries after.
The face of the coin showed a shield, and on the back was the Virgin Mary. From 1471 the picture of the Virgin Mary appeared on the forint coin too.
Because of the 1521 Turkish campaign the royal court made changes in the minting of money, which had been unchanged since 1467.
This innovation meant the devaluation of money, the 'new coins' containing only half the amount of silver as that of the older coins.
This experiment lasted until 1525. Although it helped solve the problems of the treasury in the short run, it could not continue as a result of inflation. By the time of the battle of Mohács expenditures took up all the income.
Foreign money was also used in the period: in Western Hungary the Austrian denarius was used, while in Transylvania the Havasalföld ospora was used.
The income from the gold and silver mines was gradually decreasing, as the mines became useless because of the deep excavations. Water leaked into the tunnels.
The maintenance of the water pumps was too expensive for the citizens of mining towns, and foreign entrepreneurs were needed.
The Fugger family, for example, had a banking network in Europe, and were the creditors of the Habsburgs.
They and their Hungarian relatives, the Thurzó brothers rented the production and trade of the Garam region copper and silver mines from 1496.
As in the 13th century the silver of Selmec, in the 14th century the gold of Körmöc, then the copper and silver of Besztercebánya were the famous products of the Hungarian mining industry.
Hungarian foreign trade was mainly with the west, and after this with the south, towards Italy, then came trade with the Polish and Rumanian principalities.
Western trade was carried out along the Danube between Vienna and Buda, or on the Danube itself, in the valley of the rivers Mura and Sava.
Cities on the borderline, Sopron and Pozsony took advantage of this trade.
It decreased later in the 1460s because of the worsening internal conflicts in Austria, something which Buda and Pest profited from.
From the west textile and iron goods were imported, and from Italy quality textile and luxury items.
Owing to King Matthias's conquest of Silesia, the road from Boroslo, through the valley of the river Vág, to the centre of the country became very important, and copper exporting was carried out here too.
The main item of export was cattle.
The cattle trade and husbandry were inseparable: Pest, Szeged and Székesfehérvár took advantage of this, as big flocks were kept in these regions.
Pest, under the authority of Buda from the 1250s, became a free royal town, its outer appearance also being determined by the cattle trade.
Originally there was a big square inside the city walls, which was built in the second half of the 15th century, and this was used for markets, but some decades later markets were to be held outside the city walls.
LANGUAGE
THE LATE OLD HUNGARIAN PERIOD
The characteristic features of the Hungarian language of the time
In the history of the Hungarian language the period starting with king Sigismund's reign, ending with the defeat at Mohács is called the late Old Hungarian period.
By this time the major linguistic changes which had started earlier came to an end (or they were very close to their end), so the form of the Hungarian language at this point was very similar to the language used today.
Through a later development the vocabulary and set of expressions and also the morphology and syntax became richer and more stable.
Linguistic development was parallel with the slow gradual material and spiritual growth .
The number of schools also increased, so the use of the written language became more and more widespread, though literacy was mainly through the medium of Latin at this time.
Besides charters, mainly religious documents were produced (theological works, sermons, legends, service books), but there were several secular works as well (especially chronicles and poems).
At first the usage of the Hungarian language was limited to actual speech, but the demand for writing and reading in Hungarian also increased, so there was a need for written Hungarian works.
First of all there were codices containing translations of Latin religious literature.
However, some Latin-Hungarian word lists and glossas for Latin sermons were also preserved.
Apart from these, independent Hungarian works also appeared in this period: e.g., poems, letters, civilian documents.
Codices
Codices were religious readings.
(The first pieces of Hungarian codices, the Jókai codex and the Hussite Bible belonged to the previous period.)
In the late Old Hungarian period the number of codex translations increased significantly.
The boom in translations was partly due to the medieval reforms of principles of monastic orders, which instructed monks to read religious texts and perform prayers.
Owing to the reform church - especially monastic - literature began to boom.
In Hungary - as abroad - this kind of literature was written in Latin.
However, Latin sermons, legends and hymns had to be translated into Hungarian for nuns who did not speak Latin.
The rich codex literature of the late Old Hungarian period grew from these translations.
The period is also known as the era of codices because of the great number of codices written at this time.
Nuns escaping from the Turkish demolition brought about 50 valuable codices with them - so these were saved.
The majority of sermons in the codices are from a collection of speeches by Pelbárt Temesvári, a Franciscan monk, who wrote them according to contemporary theological literature and made them more interesting by adding instructive stories to them.
His collection of speeches, called the Rose Wreath, was finished by his Benedictine student, Osvát Laskai.
The other main source of the legends of the codices was a collection known as Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend), the work of a Dominican monk, Jacobus a Voragine ( 1298).
This collection was very popular all over the world.
Another source of the legends was the Italian bishop, Petrus de Natalibus's ( 1400) Catalogus Sanctorum (the list of saints, that is the series of legends of saints), which was published in printed form in 1493, and contains more than 3,000 legends.
Codices were translated into Hungarian by monks.
But most of the codices were preserved in the form of copied versions, and not in their original version.
Copiers were also monks or nuns.
In several monasteries of the country - in the richer ones - there were copy workshops.
The Dominicans, for example, worked in the monastery on Margaret Island (then the Island of Rabbits); the Franciscans worked in Óbuda (in the Clarissan monastery), in Buda, Sepsiszentgyörgy and Marosvásárhely; the Paulians in Nagyvázsony; the Premontreans in Somlóvásárhely.
Certain copying workshops often lent the copied codices to other workshops, so some texts are identical in several codices.
In this period the language of literature was not standardised, the copiers usually copying the texts into their own dialect.
However, the change of codices encouraged the unification of the written language.
Different codices were copied by one hand (that is a monk or nun), or at other times by several hands.
Only a few names of the copiers have survived: for example, Paul Váci, Andrew Nyújtódi, Bertholomew Halábori, Paul Tetemi, student Michael, Lea Ráskai, and Martha Sövényházi.
Copiers of codices often made personal notes during copying: they asked their readers to pray, apologised for bad writing, gave thanks for being able to finish their work.
For example, "The one who wrote this asks for an Ave Maria prayer"; "pray for the sinner who wrote this.
Alleluia"; "I was very ill"; "I have a bad headache"; "Thank God".
Lea Ráskai's notes are especially interesting.
Most of the codices were copied in the workshops of Dominican and Franciscan monks (17 Dominican and 17 Franciscan codices have survived).
The majority of the Dominican codices are designed books containing only one long unit of text. These were probably written for the nuns of Margaret Island.
The oldest of them is the Birk codex from 1474, which was written by Paul Váci, a Dominican monk.
The lack of certain parts and corrections of the text suggest that it might be the original composition, a draft of the translation.
The first part contains St August's regulations, while in the second part we can read about the instructions concerning the life style of Dominican nuns.
(In today's reading: "So that you can see yourselves in this little book like a mirror, so that you won't miss anything because of your forgetfulness, it must be read once a week".)
The huge Winkler codex (1506) was written by three persons and it is quite mixed regarding its content.
It starts with a calendar, and the second part is a well-designed hora book.
You can find prayers and litanies in Latin and Hungarian in it.
In other parts we can read different parts of the gospels, Mary's laments (because of Christ's sufferings) and prayers and legends in verse.
Certain parts of it are original Hungarian works.
The most outstanding ones from among Dominican codices are Lea Ráskai's codices.
The best-known one is the Margaret legend from 1510, which tells of King Béla IV's daughter, St Margaret (of the Árpád dynasty)'s life.
The original text of the legend was written by Marcellus, the head of the Dominican order, Margaret's confessor for the investigation of the canonisation.
The codex was divided into three parts.
The first one describes Margaret's lifestyle in the nunnery, the second part tells of her miraculous deeds and the third one contains the statements of her fellow nuns made in front of the canonisation committee.
The legend describes Margaret's humble and self-sacrificing life, but we can read about the everyday life of contemporary monasteries.
The corrections and crossings out in the codex show that Lea Ráskai corrected and modified her text.
Lea Ráskai's second outstanding biographical codex was the Dominican codex of 1517.
In this she describes St Dominique's life in detail and introduces the history of the "preaching monks", that is the Dominican order, which he founded.
She commemorates the fact that St Dominique sent Master Paul (Paul of Hungary) to Hungary to preach.
The codex tells of several miracles, parables, visions from the saint's life.
Its style is very impressive and powerful.
We can find several expressions from the subject of teaching, science and education. For example, student, dean, master, school, science, learn.
Lea Ráskai copied the major part of the Book of Parables in 1510 (from page 19 to page 64).
The other two copiers of the codex are unknown.
Its Latin source was a collection of religious parables from the 15th century, which contained moral teachings and parables.
The most significant of its parables are the conversation on life and death and the so-called death dance, which emphasises the terrible fact that death knows no distinctions.
In the first part of the Cornides codex, which was copied between 1514 and 1519, we can find sermons for the significant feasts of the ecclesiastical year.
The main source of these was a collection of speeches from the 15th century.
The second part of the codex tells of the legends of female saints, who died as martyrs in the first centuries of Christianity.
At a certain place Lea Ráskai noted down the date of copying and she also revealed her name there (after Saint Justina's biography): raskay lea.
The different notes at the end of certain units of the text provide information about the events of the age and the life of the monastery: about the reconsecration of the chapel, the death of Emeric Perényi and the Dózsa peasants' revolt.
Lea Ráskai's writing had an individual character with a firm line tracing.
Her spelling was correct and logical; she was one of the most outstanding copiers of her age.
On the basis of her name written in the Cornides codex we can identify the codices which were copied by her.
The Jordánszky codex, compiled between 1516 and 1519, is a thick Dominican codex.
Its content, similarly to the Hussite Bible, is a Bible translation, but independent of the latter one.
It included certain parts of the Old Testament, the four gospels, the Acts and other parts of the New Testament.
Its spelling and language show similarities with the Érdy codex (for example, it doubles the letters when it refers to vowels é and á).
Its copier is not known.
The Booklet about the Honours of the Saint Apostles from 1521 describes a contest between the apostles and other saints in a conversational form, imitating living speech.
It enlists the reasons why the apostles are more honourable than other saints.
The original version of the codex was an unknown Latin essay.
The text mentions Dante, and the first lines of metrical poetry appeared here for the first time in the Hungarian language.
The codex must have been copied by a Dominican nun in the nunnery of Margaret Island.
The greatest Dominican codex is the beautiful Érsekújvár codex dating from 1529-1531. It was copied by three persons and was decorated with painted pictures, too.
Most of it was written by the nun Martha Sövényházi.
Its content is mixed: it contains lental and Easter gospels, as well as short teachings and parables.
Its most famous part is the legend of Saint Katharine of Alexandria in verse.
It is a scientific work full of theological essays.
The main source was Pelbárt Temesvári's sermons and a medieval Latin book of sagas.
The translator did a very good job putting the text into Hungarian with a very good sense of rhythm, independent of the original Latin text.
Other Dominican codices are: the Horváth codex from 1522 (Lea Ráskai's writing), the Gömöri codex (1516), the Virginia codex (1529), the Kriza codex (1532) and maybe the Christina legend (1510) and the Thewrewk codex (1531).
The majority of the codices copied by Franciscan monks contain parts of the gospels, sermons as well as legends, essays and songs.
Most of them were copied in the rich Clarissan nunnery in Óbuda.
The earliest of them is the Guary codex from around 1490.
Its copier might have been Lucas Segösdi, the head of the order at that time.
It was copied precisely, and had a nice look with beautiful language. It contains religious essays and teachings.
Certain parts are parallel with the text of the Nádor codex.
Its spelling partly follows the spelling of the Hussite Bible.
The Nádor codex was also copied for the Clarissans of Óbuda by an unknown copier in 1508.
It contains meditations, legends, holy songs and a list of sins for confessions.
Certain parts of it are identical with texts of the same topic of other codices (for instance, the Winkler codex, the Érdy codex, the Kazinczy codex).
In this codex we can find the oldest Hungarian noted song.
Its songs are Hungarian folk songs - one of them still being sung even in the 17th century.
The copier of the long Nagyszombat codex, which was made in 1512 and 1513, is also unknown.
A large part of the codex is devoted to meditations and essays.
It also includes the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the "I believe" prayer and the explanation of the salvation - and also a list of sins.
A few of its teachings let the reader know about the concepts of the medieval natural science.
For example, it states that the Sun is eight times bigger than the Earth, there is five times more water on Earth than soil, and there is a heaven above the starry sky.
The dialect of the codex uses ö-s and ü-s.
The greatest Franciscan codex is the Debrecen codex, copied in 1519.
The first part of this tells of the legends of the saints, who are celebrated from St Andrew's Day (November 30) till March 25.
The second part includes teachings and legends of other saints.
The Kazinczy codex was compiled for a very long time: the dates 1526, 1527 and 1541 are written into it.
So it must have been finished after the defeat at Mohács, but before the occupation of Buda and the escape of the Clarissans of Óbuda.
It was copied by three unknown monks; the second and the third one used the ö-dialect (it used the sound ö instead of the sound e.) This codex is a collection of sermons, proverbs and legends.
It contains valuable romantic proverbs and legends (e.g.: the St Anna legend, the St Elek legend and the legend called Barlam and Josafa).
Its copier asks for an Ave Maria from the reader.
Other Franciscan codices made in Óbuda and Buda are the Simor codex (1508), the Weszprémi codex made in 1512, the Lobkowitz codex (1514), the Bod codex (around 1520), the Sándor codex (around 1518), the Vitkovics codex (1525), the Miskolc Fragments (1525) and the Tihany codex (1532).
Franciscan codices made in Transdanubia contain translations of psalms.
The Keszthely codex was copied in 1522 by Gregory Velikei in Léka in county Vas for third order nuns.
The copier noted down the date and his name onto one of the pages of the codex.
The Kulcsár codex, made in 1539, was written by Paul Pápai, a Franciscan monk in Ozora, in county Tolna.
Some Franciscan codices were made in Transylvania.
The most outstanding of these is the Székelyudvarhely codex.
The first two parts of it - The Book of Judith and the catechism - were translated and written down by the monk Andrew Nyujtódi in 1526.
He translated it - as he wrote - for his "beloved sister, Judith Nyujtódi", a nun from Tövis.
He asked his sister not to consider his "peasant style, but the real meaning of it".
The translation of the Book of Judith from the Old Testament existed in the Hussite Bible as well as the Vienna codex, but this is independent of those.
Its text shows a lot of similarities with today's Székely dialect.
We can also find the first Hungarian catechism in this codex.
The other parts contain meditations and parts of the gospels.
The copier of these parts may have been Judith Nyujtódi herself, the owner of the codex.
The note on a page refers to this: "This book belongs to the virgin Judith: it was written in the year 1528 in Tövis".
The Teleki codex was made for the beginas of Marosvásárhely (1525-1531). Its legends are romantic stories written in an imaginative style.
The Zelma Lázár codex might also have been copied in Marosvásárhely, after 1525.
The Festetics codex, written around 1494, and its supplementary book, the Czech codex from 1513 are the works of Paulian monks and these are two old books of prayers.
Both of them were made in the Paulian monastery of Nagyvázsony (county Veszprém) for Mrs Kinizsi, a Hungarian Begina.
The Festetics codex is a beautifully decorated book of prayer.
Its special value is that it contains the first Hungarian translation of Petrarc's seven repentance psalms.
In the Czech codex we can find private prayers besides the offices.
The most significant of them are St Brigitte's 15 prayers and a beautiful poem: St Bernard's hymn to the crucified Christ.
The Peer codex most probably originates from the Paulian monastery of Nagyvázsony from around 1518.
It is a work of six persons; its writers are unknown.
It contains legends, prayers and poems.
Andrew Vásárhelyi's beautiful song is a prayer in verse to the Virgin Mary, the patron saint of Hungary.
The poet included his initials in the starting lines of the verses.
The other beautiful poem of the codex is a song about King St Ladislaus.
We can find the Cantilena here too, a mocking, jeering song about priests written by Francis Apáti.
The codex also includes an eternal calendar, the so-called csízió (calendar), which is a translation of a calendar written in verse, very popular throughout Europe.
A similar calendar has survived from earlier times; it was preserved in a Latin codex, the Thuróczi codex, written after 1462.
There are very few codices from Premontrean monks.
One of them is the Döbrente codex from 1508, which was copied by Bartholomew Halábori, a priest and royal clerk.
It contains translations of psalms, sermons, parts of the gospels and hymns.
But we can also find a tale in it, - simply called "Tale".
The codex is the oldest memory of the i-dialect of the Tisza region (it uses the sound i instead of the sound é).
The Lányi codex is also from the Premonreans. It was copied in 1519.
Written for the nuns of Somlóvásárhely, it describes the rules, regulations and religious ceremonies of the Premontrean order.
The best known Hungarian codex - and also the biggest collection of Hungarian legends - is the Érdy codex.
It was written and translated by an unknown Carthausian monk between 1524 and 1527 in Lövöld (Városlõd).
The codex was compiled for "all monks and nuns".
Besides its Latin preface it also has a Hungarian preface; this is the first preface in Hungarian in Hungarian literature.
The book is a collection of speeches based on Pelbárt Temevári's sermons: it contains Sunday sermons, legends about the life of saints and explanations of the gospels.
The legends about Hungarian saints are quite significant.
The unknown Carthausian was an independent, brave translator; his vocabulary was very rich.
The language he used was the most developed dialect of the age.
Glossas, word lists
We have already mentioned the glossas (explanatory notes written to Latin texts) and the Latin-Hungarian word lists, which made learning easier, in the previous part of the series.
With the growth of Latin education the number of glossas and word lists increased significantly in the late Old Hungarian period.
There are glossas from this period both in religious and secular texts.
Most of the glossas are from a Latin collection of sermons, which were compiled into two connected codices, called the Sermones Dominicales ("Sunday Sermons").
The two codices are copies of a series of sermons written in 1456.
The glossas were attached to the text to help the Hungarian performance of the speeches.
For example, glossa: explanatory note, philosopher: pagan wise man, bibliothek: book chamber.
The two copies in total contain 6,200 Hungarian words.
The Jászó Glossas originate from around 1460.
They were discovered in the library of the Premontrean monastery of Jászóvár (Jasov, Slovakia), in a collection of Latin manuscripts.
It contains 23 Hungarian words.
The Zirc Glossas were entered into the collection of sermons of a Premontrean monastery at around 1470-1480.
The glossas contain about 20 words.
We can find more glossas (about 400) in the collection called the Nagyváty Glossas.
These were written around 1490 to the text of a Bible printed in 1478.
The vocabulary is quite mixed, with lots of secular words contained in it.
The Szalkai Glossas (1490) were written by secular priests and students.
Ladislaus Szalkai noted down 440 Hungarian words into the school book of Sárospatak.
His words show the growth of vocabulary encouraged by Latin education, and they are significant additions to the history of Hungarian literary language.
For example, the word poeta means the "creator of poems" for him, but he also uses the word as "poet".
The word muzsák [muses] means "female poets"; the word törlít [write] means "write, create a written work".
The Ábel word list from around 1490 is of secular origin.
It must have been written after dictation; it contains 220 pairs of word including conversational expressions.
We can also find a list of numbers in it.
The word list was discovered in Jenõ Ábel's heritage.
From among glossas originating from the beginning of the 16th century, the most significant ones are the Gyöngyös Glossas from 1520, containing 600 words.
These can be found in the manuscript of a Latin codex describing the rules of the observant Franciscan order.
The glossas (454 glossas) of the Ortus Sanitatis ("The Origin of Health"), a scientific work, from around 1525 are also quite outstanding.
These might have been made by a doctor.
The work describes three classes of nature (plants, animals, minerals).
Some original (that is not based on a translation) Hungarian written memories are also from the late Old Hungarian period.
Most of them are secular works.
They include a historic song, but poems can also be found, as well as fragments of poems, civilian documents and letters.
The most outstanding of them may be a 150-line historic song from 1476, Szabács's Battle.
Its unknown author wrote about King Matthias's famous deed, the siege of the fortress of Szabács near the bank of the Száva river.
This historic song might have been written not very long after the occupation of the fortress.
In all probability it is a fragment of a longer poem.
Earlier it was considered to be a forgery because of its perfect metric features.
However, modern research showed that it might be an original work of art after all.
The oldest cursing was recorded in 1479.
The Hungarians swore at their enemies, the Germans; they threatened them thus: "you drank our blood before, but now we will drink your blood".
The cursing was attached to the text of the Latin Dubnic Chronicle from 1479.
The Bagonya Curses from 1488 contain three superstitious folk curses.
The first one was used for curing the ulcer of a "reddish horse", the second one for curing the limping of a horse, and the third one for getting rid of the warts of a man called John.
The oldest memory of love poetry is the Sopron love song from 1490.
In today's reading it says: "Little flower, you have to know I must leave you.
And I must wear mourning clothes because of you".
During the time between the end of the 15th century and the battle of Mohács (August 29, 1529) a lot of private letters, juridistic and other civilian documents were written.
The most significant of these were the following:
The first Hungarian missile letter is from 1479-1490.
It was written by Aladar Várday to his brother, Michael Várady.
In his letter Aladar ensured him that his case was also supported by the voivode.
Emeric Török's greetings in verse originate from 1485.
The writer greeted his lady, Christina in the postscript of a Latin letter.
The first Hungarian invoice is Andrew Vér's safe-conduct from 1493.
In this Andrew Vér admitted that his debtor, Blasius Erdõhegyi had given him 20 forints from his 100-forint debt.
The first testament that survived is from 1507 and it was written by Stephen Cheh, who had left his estate, mill and movable property to his wife and children.
A rare memory of court literacy is a sentence from the court of honour from 1516.
In this document the state judges reconciled the governor of Croatia with the ban of Jajca, whom he had slandered.
Mária Drágffy's list of dowry (from 1516) is a valuable document from the point of view of educational and linguistic history. It contains a lot of words which do not exist today (name of jewellery, types of textiles).
For example, majc, which meant "a ribbon weaved from gold and silver threads"; násfa, which meant "necklace"; gíra, which meant "the measurement of weight used for measuring gold and silver"; futa, which also meant "a type of textile"; velez, which meant "a type of textile"; salfil, which meant "saphire".
A lot of private letters have survived from the weeks before the defeat at Mohács.
Francis Batthány's letter to his wife, for instance, is a moving good-bye letter and his letter to the ban Doroszlay, in which they apologise to each other, is also beautiful.
Another outstanding example is Ilona Bocskay's (she was head of a nunnery) letter to her nephew, Stephen Bocskay, who died in the battle of Mohács. It was written before August 19, 1526.
In this letter "Elena, a priorist nun from the Island of Rabbits", asks her brother not to disturb the villeins of the church.
The special feature of the letter is that it was not written by the sender but by Lea Ráskai, who lived in the Dominican nunnery of the Island of Rabbits and was a librarian there.
THE SYSTEM OF THE LANGUAGE
Vocabulary
Linguistic memories seem to indicate that the system of the language of the late Old Hungarian period - regarding both vocabulary and grammar - was subject of further development.
One way of enriching vocabulary was for the old words to gain new meanings, especially the main parts of speech: verbs and nouns.
For example, the word atya [father], which originally meant "father", then "priest", gained the meaning "God". The words úr [gentleman] and ember [man] gained the new meaning "husband"; the word fél [half of something] began to mean "wife".
The meaning of words galamb [pigeon], virág [flower] enriched with the meaning "my love", when addressing a beloved person.
The word family of nyomorodik, nyomorog, megnyomorít [live a poverty-stricken life, lead a miserable life], which originate from the word "weigh, put weight on something or someone", got the new meaning "go into bankruptcy, suffer, destroy" at this time.
The number of words formed by word formation increased significantly. Such words are the Hungarian equivalents of to keep a fast, make someone sad, to shave, to smooth out, to be identical, to fade, credit, to be known, to beg, ban, communal, final, and eternal.
A lot of words which do not have their independent original word also date from this period. For example, the Hungarian words for to drown, to mend, to blaze up, round, to roll up, bladder, and to know.
A lot of compound words appeared at this time, too. For example, atyafi [son of someone], baromfi [chick of a hen], bõkezû [generous], fenevad [beast], gondviselés [divine grace], holteleven [threatened to kill] and pártütés [revolt].
The nouns folyosó [corridor], himlõ [plague], lakó [dweller] originate from verbs.
The stock of onomatopoeic words formed by inner word formation also grew. Such words are babuk [a bird], bíbic [another bird], borzad [to be shocked], borzas [scruffy], hopp [jump!], paskol [to pat], and karattyol [to chat].
In connection with the changes in economic and social life and due to peaceful or war-like relations with other peoples a lot of loan words were built into the language in this period.
Slav loan words from this age are vecsernye "evening prayer", barack [peach], cirok [broomcorn], gázol [wade], goromba [rude], hofnica "a type of canon", kolompár "tinman", rab [prisoner].
Latin loan words were related to religious life, as well as mental and material education. For example, árguvál "argue", biblia [Bible], augusztus [August], cédula [label], forma [form], ciprus [cypress], cifra [colourful], cirkalom [decoration], cirkál [circulate], fáklya [torch], farizeus [the Pharises], flaska [bottle], grácia [grace], and iskola [school].
German loan words referred mainly to urban and court life and trades. For example, cégér [signboard], céh [guild], cérna [thread], cél [aim, goal], böllér [pig-slaughterman], erkély [balcony], gúnár [goose], kapucni [hood], islóg "a small shining metal plate used for decoration".
Italian loan words are from the vocabulary of military, court and urban life. Such words are bástya [bastion], kandalló [fire place], falkonáta "a light fire arm, or type of canon", karazsia "a type of thick textile", trombita [trumpet].
From this period some Rumanian loan words have also survived: bács "responsible shepherd", cimbora [friend], katrinca "apron". There were loan words from the period which latest became widespread throughout Europe. These were bank [bank], gránát "a kind of precious stone", garas [groat], kapitány [captain], and firis "a piece of clothing".
Besides the group of verbs and nouns, smaller parts of speech - which are important in the grammatical structure of sentences - also developed.
These were not loan words, they originated from the Hungarian language.
Such words (which were originally nouns with adverbial suffixes) are: balra [on/to the left], nyomban [immediately], végre [finally], õsszel [in autumn], egyedül [alone], különben [otherwise], oldalt [on the side], örömest [with pleasure], nyilván [obviously], alattomban [in secret].
A lot of adverbs were formed by combining words. For example, ahol [where], amikor [when], imígy [like this], ugyanottan [at the same place], valahol [somewhere], soha [never], sehol [nowhere].
Adverbs became pre- or postpositions of verbs.
The adverbs alá [under], elé [in front of], által [by], felül [above], egybe [together], össze [to/gether], hátra [back/wards], ide [here, towards this direction], vissza [back/wards] were already used as pre- or postpositions of verbs.
This period is a milestone from the point of view of the development of conjunctions.
Some conjunctions originated from adverbs, such as viszont [but, however], tovább [later on, and], meg [and], azért,ezért [for this/that reason, so], így [so /that/], tehát [so], and aztán [then].
The words hiszen (< hiszem [I believe]) and talán (< találom [I find]) developed from conjugated verb forms.
Several adverbs and participles became modifying words. For example, bizony [certainly], inkább [rather], úgy [that way, like that], monnal [as], bátor [let it be], bezzeg [in contrast], íme [see], lám [well, see], nyilván [obviously, surely].
The sign of superlatives became the emphasise -leg, and the signs of comparative -b/bb.
The development of definite and indefinite articles were finalised in this period.
The development started at the beginning of the period continued among proper nouns.
The majority of proper nouns, which had earlier consisted of a single element, contained two elements in the late Old Hungarian period: a personal name and an adjective, which named a characteristic feature of the person.
The structure of constructions for personal names are different in charters and other textual memories.
The majority of the constructions in charters are Latin structures: the adjective stands after the Christian name and it is connected to the name by the help of the Latin word dictus "said, named" or the preposition de (originating from the suffixes -ból/-bõl, -ról/-rõl [...is from]).
Here are some examples from the Hungarian Charter Dictionary: Nicolai dicti Garazda, Velentini dicti Feketew, Ewden de Naghmyhal.
Names without the Latin word: Johanna Galambos, Paulo Halaz, Johannes Kazdag.
In the textual memories (codices, letters) the adjective elements stand before the name - in accordance with Hungarian word order.
For example, in the Érdy codex: Burgundyay Sygmond kyral.
These adjectives later became family names, which could be inherited.
This process started among the nobles: Bekefy Janus, Lakosantalháza (in a place name).
In medieval Hungarian letters personal names were referred to thus: Batthyany Ferenc, Ver Andras, Dragffy Janos.
Among the lower social classes family names developed later, in the 16-17th centuries.
Place names were compound words.
The traditions connected to giving names were the same as earlier traditions.
Places were usually named after the patron saint of the church of the given place: Szentmárton, Szentimre, Szentgyörgy, Szentmihályúr.
Another popular way of naming places was that the place was named after the nationality of the dwellers: Magyarvég, Németegyház, Szászvég, Oroszfalu.
The grammatical system
The changes in the grammatical system followed the previous trends.
The most important phonetic changes (such as assimilation, lengthening, the simplification of diphthongs) had already been completed, or were about to be.
Due to phonetic changes the roots of words also changed.
By the end of the period the modern type roots, which are used today, had been created: one- and multi-form roots (for example, ház : házat, kéz : kezet, varjú : varjak, ajtó : ajtaja, ökör : ökröt, lõ : lövök, nyugodni : nyugszik, tesz : tevõ, alszik : aludni, hó : havas).
The system of suffixes also widened.
Besides the suffixes used earlier new, compound suffixes also appeared. For example, -doz/-dez/-döz, -sít/-sül, -dokol/-dekel/-dököl, aszt/-eszt, -aml/-eml, -ós/-õs, -cska/-cske, -dad/-ded, -ika, -lat/-let, -ság/-ség, -zat/-zet.
The independent word fi "someone's son, boy", and né "someone's wife, from the word nõ [woman]" became a suffix.
The possessive sign -é became a suffix making place names.
In conjugation the rules of the usage of definite and indefinite conjugation (that is objective and subjective conjugation) also developed fully in this period.
More tenses were used at that time than today.
Events of the past were referred to by four different past tenses.
In the narrative the mene, láta forms [approximately simple past] were used, while imperfect activities (imperfectum) were expressed by the megy vala, lát vala forms [past continuous].
Completed actions in the past (perfectum) were expressed by ment, látott forms [simple past], and the past perfect was also used: ment vala, látott vala.
Towards the end of the period the most frequently used form was the perfectum [simple past] (ment, látott).
Future events were expressed by present forms, the -nd forms (menend), or by a compound form: with the auxiliary verb fog [will] and the infinitive.
The usage of verb modality in compound sentences shows a strong Latin influence.
The verbal subjects of clauses are in the conditional, following Latin rules.
For example, in the Dominican codex (in modern spelling): "When he would have caught someone"; "He said that an altar would be set for him, who would be prayed for"; in the Margaret legend: "When he would have heard a lot of miracles about martyr Saint Thomas..."
The system of the inflection of nouns also develops: the number of adverbial suffixes increases.
The suffixes -szor/-szer/-ször, -nként/-nkéd, -stul/-stül, -lan/-len, -lag/-leg became inflective suffixes at this time.
The usage of the suffix of the adverb of place -n, -on/-en/-ön and that of the adverb of manner -n, -an/-en became separated.
From among the versions of adverbial suffixes derivated from postfixes (for example, belé -be, belõl -bõl) the shorter versions (-ba/-be, -ból/-bõl) became general.
The system of sentences varies considerably in this period.
All today's sentence types were used, although we can find significant differences in the dissection of texts.
We can hardly ever find punctuation marks in the texts.
The most commonly used marks are the full stop and the comma. Question marks also appear during the period, however exclamation marks are not at all used.
The usage of the existing punctuation marks is also inconsistent.
There are a lot of adjectival predicates in the sentences, especially at the beginning of the period.
For example (in today's spelling), in the Nádor codex: "I'm being resurrective"; in the Birk codex: "it would be giving reason"; in the Book of Proverbs: "I'll be becoming dust".
By the end of the period predicates with participles are substituted by noun predicates.
The agreement of subject and verb in number often follows Latin rules: the verb is the plural if the subject is an adjective of quantity or a number.
The number of governing rules among the complements of the verb and participles increases.
Considering nouns, the adjectives of quality are used to decorate the style and create an appropriate atmosphere there: "dreadful death, tough speech, sad saying, incredible pain" - these were often accumulated: "sweet spoken doctor Saint Bernard, sad and miserable hour, glittering and shining gold".
The usage of noun adjectives encouraged the process where certain nouns became adjectives.
Such adjectives are "dús" [thick, rich] (originally 'senator'), and "derék" [brave, good] (originally 'body, trunk').
The participal adjective való [being] is quite commonly used at the beginning of the period; for example, messze való föld [a land being very far], hamar való idõben [a time being close].
Later these were substituted by simpler adjectives.
The agreement of structures with adjectives of quantity often shows Latin influence in the codices: the noun is in the plural. For example: three victims, three thousand warriors.
This kind of agreement is very rare in letters.
In structures with possessive adjectives the suffixes -nak/-nek are often used: Istennek félelme [fear of God], Úrnak szentje [The Lord's saint].
There are a lot of structures with possessive personal pronouns: én házam [my house], te anyád [your mother].
The reason for this is partly the Latin example of the usage of possessives, and partly the fact that they wanted to emphasize the person, the possessor.
The number of structures with appositive complements also increases.
Different versions of nouns can also be found in this period.
Adjectives can also have complements, which are always adverbs.
The adverbs of adjectives are used to colour and decorate the style. for example, igen jó, fölötte érdekes [quite good, very interesting].
All kinds of subordinating and coordinating word structures are used.
In compound sentences all types of subordinating and coordinating clauses can be found.
The system of compound sentences already existed in the Ancient Hungarian period, in the late Old Hungarian period their further development can be seen.
Analysing the linguistic development of the period, we can state that the vocabulary is rich and colourful, and the grammatical system is firm and flexible.
LITERATURE
HUNGARIAN LITERATURE
The Boom of Hungarian Literature in Monasteries between 1470 and 1530
The two literary phenomena of the second half of the 15th century were the adoption of Latin humanist literature and the development of Hungarian literature in monasteries.
This latter one was closely related to Latin church literature.
Its literary significance is not in its originality, content or independent aesthetic values, but rather in the effort the translators made, which encouraged the birth of a written Hungarian literary language within a couple of decades.
At the same time the opportunity to learn to read and write became available for those who could not speak Latin.
This whole process was encouraged by the demands of a rather small social group: nuns who did not speak Latin, lay brethren who did the manual work and some keen secular persons.
Before the middle of the 15th century only very few Hungarian codices were made.
Religious education, that is preaching was in the mother tongue from the beginning, law cases were tried in Hungarian, too, but everything was recorded in Latin.
Literate persons spoke Latin, too, but the believers and clients could not even read Hungarian.
Translations were made by word of mouth, so the language slowly developed and was sufficient to express abstract theological ideas as well as juridistic ones.
The direct influence of Latin grammar was very strong as Latin texts were translated in writing word by word.
The translation of the Francis legend made around 1370 (Jókai codex, 1440) shows the difficulties: the Hungarian text is meaningless at several places due to the direct use of foreign grammatical structures, which do not exist in Hungarian.
The Hungarian Francis legend might have been translated for Franciscan monks whose Latin was very poor. The Bible translation, the so-called Hussite Bible (Vienna-, Munich-, Apor codex) was made in the first third of the 15th century, and its origin is debated.
No other Hungarian codices are known from this period, but there might not have been more than a dozen in any case.
However, 40 codices survived from 1470-1530, most of them being copies.
The preserved copies refer back to 200-300 codices, which were destroyed, and this number shows the increased demand for literature in the mother tongue.
From this time on codices were made continuously, for a certain social group about a certain topic.
The quick development of Hungarian literature in monasteries was helped along by numerous factors.
Several reforms were introduced during the 15th century to reconstruct the strict principles of cloisters, which had become slack by this time.
For example, a better quality of education was provided, where Latin and literacy were compulsory.
Nuns were supervised by 'reformed' monks, who checked that principles were being observed in the nunnery, and they also mediated in the development of a new, personal religious devotion (devotio moderna).
Nuns who did not speak Latin were not satisfied with common Latin offices, the text of which they did not understand, and they wanted to pray and meditate independently.
The texts for these prayers were chosen and translated by monks, who learnt to read - some of them even to write - in Hungarian.
The Characteristic Features of Hungarian Literature in the Monasteries
The content of the Hungarian texts was defined by the spiritual needs of the new readers. This was religious literature which encouraged spiritual growth, education and devotion.
These were not original works of art, but translations of Latin liturgical works. Hard-working translators and copiers made these texts available in Hungarian throughout a period of 50-60 years.
Although the Latin sources had already appeared in print by this time, hand-written Hungarian codices were always unique, individual collections.
A lot of them had a mixed content.
Some of the codices served the whole monastic communities, and were read during meals or at the chapter room in the evenings.
Others were made for personal use, and private reading.
The Monastic Background of the Codices
The majority (33 pieces) of the codices, which are also linguistic memories as well, were the property of the two begging orders: the Franciscans and the Dominicans.
The centre of the Hungarian Dominican order was the famous St Michael monastery, including the college of the order. The nunnery on the Island of Rabbits (Margaret Island) might have been reformed from here, too.
In the name of the reforms Paul Váci had St Augustine's regulations and the resolutions of the order translated for the nuns in 1474.
The fragments of the original manuscript of Paul Váci are called the Birk codex.
Under the supervision of the Dominican monks the nunnery on the island became the main centre of collecting and copying Hungarian codices.
Opposite the nunnery, on the other bank of the river Danube, was the nunnery of the Óbuda Clarissans. This was supervised by a close cloister of the Marian Franciscans, who also provided Hungarian readings.
Clarissan and Dominican nuns often lent codices to each other for copying.
The Paulians of Nagyvázsony gave away two prayer books to the wife of their founder, Mrs Kinizsi, Benigna Magyar.
One of these was the richly decorated Festetics codex, made in 1493, the other was the Czech codex from 1513.
The Peer codex, which probably contained prayers, also originated from the cloister of Vázsony. It was made for a secular customer.
The Premontrean Lányi codex (1518-1519) is a book of instructions, which describes the order of Latin services in Hungarian.
It is the only book of instructions in the mother tongue in Europe.
The Carthausian monastery of Lövöld was a very special one. The Érdy codex was made here.
The Carthausians did not have a nunnery, and did not deal with the spiritual care of secular persons, either, but the first significant codex writer originated from here. He compiled a collection of preachings and legends and for a whole year ignored the expectations of the order.
The Translators
The translators of codices were usually ordinary monks, about whom we know very little.
According to the customs of the Middle Ages they did not even record their own names.
Paul Váci, Magister of theology, was identified only later as the translator of the Birk codex, based on references in the history of the order.
The other translator who is known by name is Andrew Nyújtódi from the Székelyföld. He was a Franciscan monk, who translated the Book of Judith from the Bible into Hungarian for his nun-sister who was also called Judith.
Nyújtódi named himself in the dedication to his sister. The Székelyudvarhely codex was his work.
The unknown Bible translator of the Jordánszky codex used a personal tone when claiming that he did not understand a part of the second book of Moses, and at the end of the fifth book he was released and asked the readers to pray for him.
The Only Conscious Author, the Carthausian Anonym
The above mentioned Érdy codex was not the mechanic translation of a completed Latin work, but a collection for the Hungarian readers.
It is not only the planned structure of the text which refers to the consciousness of the author, but also a longer and a shorter Hungarian preface.
In the Latin prologue the author declared for whom and why he compiled his work, and besides this he provides useful information about himself, although he did not mention his own name.
The author known in the history of literary historiography as the Carthausian Anonym wanted to provide useful readings for nuns and lay brethren of different orders in spite of the threatening Lutheran heresy.
He translated the preachings and relevant part of the gospels for all the feasts and celebrations, then he added long commentaries to these, and provided the legend of the given saint at the celebrations of saints.
The final version of this work was the Érdy codex (1526).
The Copiers
Copiers were often monks, but there were some nuns as well, who could not only read but also write.
The most famous one was Lea Ráskai, who copied five codices (Margaret legend 1510, Book of Parables 1510, Cornides codex 1514-1519, St Dominique's life 1517, Horváth codex 1522).
She was a nun from the Island of Rabbits, who was not just a simple copier of books, but often made comments on the text, and in her clauses she referred to the local or national event of the given year.
She may also have been the librarian of the nunnery.
Martha Sövényházi also lived in the nunnery. Her work was St Katharine of Alexandria's Legend in Verse in the Érsekújvár codex.
Nuns usually put down words of emotion next to the text being copied, but sometimes they made comments about their headache, too.
Codices, Genres, Works
The scientific value of the codices, which are also linguistic sources, was recognised only at the beginning of the last century, at which time they were regularly collected and published.
They usually got their names at that time, too, some of them from the place where they were kept (Debrecen codex), some from their content (Dominican codex), some from their owners (Lobkowitz codex) or the person who discovered them (Czech codex).
Names were needed because they did not have titles - in accordance with medieval customs -, and it would have been impossible to identify them according to their genres only (such as prayer books), as there were several codices with similar contents.
In addition to this, the majority of the manuscripts have a mixed content.
For example, the long Érsekújvár codex contains parts of the gospels, sermons, short parables and legends as well as essays.
Texts of different genres are connected by the fact that they were all supposed to be read out.
However, different genres in a work could have been organised as a whole, such as in the above mentioned Érdy codex.
About Bible Translations
Readings from the Bible could be found in different versions.
A systematic, but not complete Bible translation was the Hussite Bible from the previous historic period.
Another systematic translation, although the translation of the Old Testament was rather poor, was the Jordánszky codex (1516-1519).
Monks read the Bible to the end in Latin once a year as part of their evening office.
There was no regular Bible reading in the mother tongue, and historic books were hardly ever used for private prayer.
Pericope and psalm translations were more popular than continuous Bible translations.
Pericopes are readings of the mass, the sermon and the gospel.
Nuns regularly met these texts in Latin, and even though they knew the sermons and the stories from the preacher's interpretation, they must have been keen on listening to them again in Hungarian in the chapter room.
Psalms were recited in Latin weekly, without being understood.
Translations of psalms helped people to understand the texts already known by heart, and enter into the spirit of these wonderful prayers.
We can find the translations of 150 psalms and the relevant breviary psalms and Bible songs in the Döbrentei- (1508), Keszthely- (1522) and Kulcsár codex (1539), besides the Apor codex.
A series of pericopes for the whole year can be found in the Érdy codex, Döbrentei codex and Székelyudvarhely codex.
Sometimes a whole book of the Bible was translated independently, for example in the case of Judith Nyújtódi.
Such translations are the Song of Songs from the Döbrentei codex, which was often used as a source of songs in the office and a very popular mystic text in the allegorical sense.
In wedding songs groom means Christ and bride means the Church.
Sermons
The sources of sermons in the mother tongue were Latin drafts of sermons including quotations from the Bible and references to highly respected church persons. Other things were added to these in live speech.
In some of the codices we can find sermons (for example, in the Cornides codex, Érsekújvár codex and Horváth codex), but we also have a systematic collection of sermons combined with two legends (these are the Érdy codex and the Debrecen codex).
These sermons were supposed to be read out, and as far as their roles were considered, they were quite close to the genre of essay (tracts) and reflection.
The direct translations (such as the speech of Dorothy from Pelbárt Temesvári's sermon in the Cornides codex) are rather boring because of the fact that the sources are mainly drafts.
However, the Carthausian Anonym - whose source was also Pelbárt Temesvári - compiled his speeches independently, as if they were a good reading.
Essays, Reflections
The most popular topics of essays (in the medieval sense of the word: messages, explanations) were, for example, monastic virtues and sins, the joys of Heaven and the tortures of Hell, the last Judgement, conscience and prayer.
Their sources were the regulations of the great Franciscan theologian and superior, St Bonaventura (1274) and his book On the Perfection of Life (Teleki-, Vitkovics-, Debrecen-, Lobkowitz- and Veszprémy codex), then one of the greatest mystic works, Thomas Kempis's Following Christ (Debrecen codex, Lobkowitz codex) and the German mystic, Henricus Suso's (1471) dialogue between Wisdom and the Student, entitled Horologium sapientiae (Nagyszombat codex).
The only tract, the original version of which was also made in Hungary, was the Booklet on the Honour of the Saint Apostles.
This systematic booklet, full of deeds, contains a witty, lively debate among the apostles, as well as a quotation from Dante and the first Hungarian hexametric line.
Legends and Parables
The church was aware of the great value of the legend and miracles of the saints, for the way they influenced people. So they read out these legends in the offices not only at feasts, but also at the table during meals.
The life of the founder of the order was an example for most of the members.
Besides the Jókai codex, two other codices also contain St Francis's legend; these are the Simor codex, copied for the Óbuda Clarissans and the Virginia codex, made for the Dominican nuns of the Island of Rabbits.
The Dominican Lea Ráskai copied the life and miracles of St Dominique in 1517 (Dominican codex).
The example of the saint of the nunnery, Margaret, would have been even more direct and convincing for the nuns (Margaret legend).
Shorter legends appeared in several codices, but only in the Érdy codex and Debrecen codex do they follow one another in the order of the feasts of the saints.
The sactorale of the Érdy codex refers to the whole year, and the main source of the legends is the most popular collection of legends of the Middle Ages, the Legenda aurea.
However, the Carthausian Anonym used other sources as well as this one.
He was the first to set down in writing the legends of Hungarian saints in Hungarian.
The sactorale of the Debrecen codex is very rich, but unfortunately it is not complete.
Most of the legends originate from the collection known as Catalogus Sanctorum.
The most popular saint must have been the ascetic ideal, St Elek, whose legend has survived in six Hungarian codices.
The parables (exemplum) were part of an independent genre. They are short, complete stories with a religious or moral message.
They are often used in sermons and essays, as they help to make abstract ideas understandable, while entertaining the listeners or readers.
A rich collection of parables is the Book of Parables.
Prayer Books
Unlike teaching genres, prayer is the direct method of reaching God.
One can pray in a community (for example, during mass or offices, the recitation of psalms also belonging here) or personally.
Prayer books were used for personal prayers.
We have nine codices which contain prayers (the most significant ones are the Festetics-, Winkler-, Peer and Kriza codex). They were all made for private persons, some of whom were secular people.
The Lord's Prayer, Ave Maria and the Credo are translations from the age of the Árpád dynasty, which were formed in live speech.
The source of these thanksgiving, prayers to Christ, Mary and the Holy Ghost must have been a Latin prayer book, known as the Hortulus animae (The Garden of Soul) in most of the cases.
The series of prayers attributed to the Swedish founder of the order, St Brigitte (1344), containing 15 prayers, were translated from this book. This series of prayers survived in 8 different codices.
Petrarc's seven repentance psalms (Festetics codex) are among the most beautiful prayers.
Church poetry - Legend in Verse
The translations of Latin hymns primarily helped to make the text comprehensible; they were not used for singing or liturgic purposes, but were read as prayers.
Although the poem was separated from the melody, some translators tried to keep the number of syllables and the Latin forms of verse.
The hymn translations of the Döbrentei- and Festetics codex are the best ones (for example, the hymn of St Ambrus: Veni Redemptor gentium - Come, Saviuor of Nations, or Ave maris stella - Ave Star of the Sea from an unknown author).
Andrew Vásárhelyi's song for the Virgin Mary is not a translation, but an independent poem to be sung.
The name of the poet can be read out from the first lines of the verses, and the date and place of the song (cantilena) was preserved in the last verse (Pest, 1508).
The most beautiful example of Hungarian poetry from the end of the Middle Ages is St Katharine of Alexandria's legend in verse, which contains 4074 lines.
Secular Poetry
The St Ladislaus song was written in two languages, Hungarian and Latin. This poem is at the borderline of church and secular lyrics.
The melody of this beautiful, well-structured song has also survived, and was composed in half ten lines.
The author of the first Hungarian satire was Francis Apáti.
In his Canilena he described Hungarian society before the defeat at Mohács, and his name was preserved in the first lines.
The oldest example of Hungarian love poetry is a two-line fragment called the Love song of Sopron from 1490.
The Körmöcbánya dance (1505) is a fragment of erotic mocking poetry.
The poem entitled Szabács's Fight (1476) is a poem of 150 lines describing one of King Matthias's military victories, and has often been referred to as a forgery.
The rhyming pattern is precise, and contains couplet rhymes, which are often quite perfect.
By the end of the Middle Ages a new type of literary language was born, which was on the one hand capable of expressing abstract ideas, and on the other hand, it was composed of Hungarian lyrics independent of the Latin language.
LATIN LITERATURE
Historical Background
The end of the Middle Ages in Hungary was the period when literary education was divided into two main parts: one of them was based on the language, the other one on concepts.
Compared to previous periods, the number of Hungarian literary memories significantly increased, but Latin literature was dominant.
The borderline of conceptions divided Latin literature from inside: on one hand there were works based on the characteristic features of the medieval Latin language and medieval ideas, but on the other hand humanist literature appeared, which followed antique Latin traditions concerning both the language and norms, and focused on the respect of the individual.
Traditional middle Latin literature produced new genres, and the number of the representatives of these genres also increased.
Juridistic and preaching literature flourished, and the significance of these genres was in the fact that they reflected and transferred the most important examples for Hungarian literacy and literary thinking.
In the last century of the Middle Ages it was not only the humanist ideas which brought about changes, but also the structure of society changed along with morality.
The number of secular lawyers increased, who - as a group of literate people - encouraged the democratisation of literature.
Religious forms were also transformed, individual religion gaining ever greater importance, and this fact had a major influence on the conceptual division of literature.
So it can be said that humanism had its influence on two major levels, the more important one beyond doubt being the lower level.
Thanks to the universities of Vienna and Krakow, more and more people were able to study, and at the end of the 15th century the majority of Hungarian students attended these two universities, which were within easy reach.
With the increase in the productivity of paper mills, there were several secular persons, living in the countryside, who occasionally or as their occupation copied books, so that owning books became possible for more and more people.
The first book sellers appeared in Buda, and in 1473 Andrew Hess founded a book print with the encouragement of Ladislaus Karai, the prior of Óbuda.
Associations were formed, the aim of which was to educate, for example, the establishment of libraries. Such associations were the Deák Association in Igló ('Fraternitas Litteratorum') and the association of 24 priests of Szepes.
In cities secular believers formed associations or religious unions around their altars, where they could study the values of ecclesiastic culture.
Historiography
Due to the influence of humanism the great synthesis of earlier Hungarian chronicle literature was born at the end of the Middle Ages in Hungary, and this had a great impact on the up-coming generations.
The author was John Thuróczy, the judge master of the High Court office, and he started his work to make up for the losses of earlier chronicles on the advise of his superior, Stephen Hásságyi.
First, based on the poem of Laurence Monaci, he added Little Charles's story to written Hungarian historiography.
Then he rewrote Hun history encouraged by his superior, Thomas Drági, who employed him as his personal judge master.
He then started to rewrite and supplement a 14th-century chronicle, to which he added John Küküllei's work about King Louis I's life.
Finally he recorded the period between the death of Little Charles and Matthias's accession to the throne, and he also made a draft of the historical events leading up to his own age.
In 1488 he had his own works printed in two editions, and as an appendix he published Master Rogerius's historic work.
When John Thuróczy wrote his work 'The History of the Hungarians' (Chronica Hungarorum) he based the facts on his readings - as well as earlier Hungarian chronicles, of course. He used several sources, quoting from antique authors and modern ones, such as Pope Pius II. He knew and used the correspondence of his contemporaries, the charters issued at the chancellery and oral traditions as well.
His chronicle is different from those of his predecessors.
His common noble origins were quite influential in his theory of society, which can be read in the text of his work: he underlined the role of the common nobility in forming society (Kézai's Hun theory) and he was unconditionally loyal to the Hunyadi family.
He thought King Matthias was the ideal principal, whose honourable predecessor was the figure of Attila, the king of the Huns.
According to Thúróczy, history is not formed by God's will, but by fate and destiny.
He thought his subject, the history of the Hungarian people, was more important than the history of ruling families, so he supplemented it with reports about the great deeds of noble lords, political debates and peasants' revolts.
The easy style of his Latin language met the demands of contemporary expectations of the chancellery: he liked similes and descriptions of nature, episodes and the taste of court literature.
His influence could be explained by his talent as a writer.
Church History
The characteristic feature of the historiography of the age was that with the strengthening of order-consciousness the monks' interest turned towards their past.
In the Paulian order, which was found in Hungary, for example, Mark Dombrói had already started to keep the yearbook of the order and the examination of historical material in the second half of the 15th century.
The results of these works were incorporated in the work of Gregor Gyöngyösi, the Paulian superior, and entitled 'The Biographies of Brethren', which was left uncompleted at the beginning of the 16th century.
Later it was finished by a colleague of Gyöngyösi, Valentine Hadnagy, but the history of the Paulian order survived only in manuscripts, although it was quite significant in regard to both its length and quality.
Gyöngyösi studied authentic sources, compiling a list of charters which were important for the history of the order.
Observant Franciscan superior, Blasius Szalkai started to compile the chronicle of his order in the middle of the century, which was later continued by others, such as Osvat Laskai.
In historiographic works there was a certain interest in the history of literature. For example, Blasius Szalkai dealt with the question of the translation of the Hussite Bible, and Gregor Gyöngyösi wrote about the poet, Adalbert Csanádi.
Memoirs
There were only a few memoirs in the Middle Ages.
Among these the most significant one was Martin Leibici's work (he was born in the Szepesség and his mother tongue was German). He studied at the universities of Krakow and Vienna, after which he joined the Benedictine order in Subiaco during a pilgrimage to Rome, and then lived out his life in the Benedictine monastery of the Scottish in Vienna.
Between 1446 and 1462 he was the abbot there, and died in 1464.
He recorded the events of his life, of the monastery and his chosen homeland, Austria in the form of a fictitious dialogue.
In the dialogue called 'Senatorium' he answered the questions of his youth (iuventis) as an old man (senex).
He underlined his experiences in Hungary as a child.
He gave a detailed picture of late medieval monastic culture in his memoirs.
The author had close ties to the leading figure of the church reform movement Nicolas Cusanus, on whose encouragement he wrote some works about the reforms of the Benedictine order.
Juristic Literature and Literacy
The first scientific synthesis of customary law regulating the life of medieval Hungary was made by Stephen Werbõczy in the first decade of the 16th century.
The author started to compile his material on the commission of king Ulaslo II, with the encouragement of the Hungarian nobility. He finished it in 1514 and entitled it 'The Triple Book of Hungarian Customary Law'.
The Tripatrium is divided into a prologue and three big parts. The parts are divided into titles, the titles into paragraphs [sections].
In the prologue the author defines the basic conceptions of law, the differences between the technical expressions of customary and Roman law, the relationship of law and customary law.
The first part describes the rights of possession for the nobility, the second part summarises civil procedure and the third part is about the juristic traditions in Transylvania and Slavonia.
In the letter of dedication added to the work the author described the conditions of the birth of his work, its significance and his own juristic and scientific intentions in the style of Viennese humanists.
His sources were the charters of the royal chancellery, earlier laws, records of sentences and living unwritten law.
Although the influence of Roman law can be felt in his work, its basis was the aspects of canon law.
Werbõczy built up his work with the help of scholastic systematic methods, which were reflected in his language.
Even though he denies the independence of his work, he absorbed the elements of the ideas of the common nobility into it.
His most important theory was the equality of the nobility, according to which there is no juridistic difference between noblemen of the different noble classes, and basic noble rights should be the privilege of every nobleman, be he a lesser nobleman, common nobleman or a baron (this was the so-called primae nonus or una eademque nobilitas). He asserted this theory by historic precedents taken from John Turóczy's chronicle.
His other important theory was the so-called Holy Crown Theory, which he developed from the doctrine of the crown - emerging from the 13th century - and the organic doctrine. He also emphasised the Hungarian king's right of grace.
Although the Tripartitum never became a law book, its influence in modern Hungary could be compared only to that of the Bible. It was translated into several languages, including Hungarian, Croatian and German, so it became the means of the development of Hungarian literary and juristic language.
The Law Book of Újlak
The market town Újlak had once been in the possession of the Újlak family who originated from the county of Szerém. In 1524 it came under the direct authority of the king.
The citizens of this prospering town - due to the fact that it was a place of pilgrimage because of John Kapisztrán's tomb - turned to the king himself and asked him to make Újlak a free royal town. First there were seven, then eight such free royal towns in Hungary.
The king supported this idea and on 13 December, 1525 he issued the law book of Újlak (in the form of a codex bound in velvet), which adopted the law of Buda in many cases and these were translated into Latin.
Even though the law book did not contain all the privileges of free royal towns, it encouraged the freedom and economic position of the citizens of Újlak.
The law book is divided into 5 books, and the books into chapters. It is certainly a unique piece of the codificational activity of late medieval law, as it recorded the rights of towns.
However, the citizens of Újlak hardly had chance to enjoy their privileges, as the following year they were forced to flee from the arms of Turkish conquerors.
Literacy was spreading and the demand for it also increased. An indication of this process was that more and more books of formulae were compiled, which were to summarise the rules of letter writing and provide examples for offices.
John Magyi compiled a collection from the samples of the royal chancellery under the title of 'Stylus cancellariae' [The Style of the Chancellery].
At the same time the work of chapters and credible places was also made easier with the appearance of a collection of chapter letter samples, made after 1521, and the Somogyvár Book of Formulae, which was compiled between 1460 and 1480, probably by the secular clerk of the Benedictine convent of Somogyvár.
The Franciscan book of formulae, compiled in the first decades of the 16th century, had a great influence, as it described the developing structure of the order, and showed the process how quickly the Observant Franciscans organised the crusade, which finally turned against their lords in 1514.
Although these books of formulae preserved old, fixed forms, modern humanist ideas and Latin style began to spread in the royal chancellery.
Travel books
Descriptions of journeys have been a very popular genre of literature since ancient times.
The oldest account by a Hungarian author and the last account of trips to the Holy Land (before the defeat at Mohács) was written in the decade preceding the catastrophe at Mohács.
The author was an Observant Franciscan monk, Gabriel Pécsváradi, who went for a pilgrimage in 1514, and spent three years in a Franciscan monastery in Jerusalem, on mount Sion, before returning to Hungary.
Being away on his journey he missed the events of the peasant's revolt in Hungary, which forced the members of the Franciscan order to come to a serious decision.
After his return home he published a work in Vienna in 1519, in which he summarised his experiences in the Holy Land in Latin.
This popular work, entitled 'A Short and Pleasant Description of the City of Jerusalem', provided the readers with important travel information, listed the sights and the possible periods of indulgence to be gained at shrines.
The outstanding value of his work lay in the fact that he was a witness, and formed his opinion on the holy places from the point of view of a Hungarian.
Hungarian authors were the first to report on the internal conflicts of the Ottoman Empire.
In Gabriel Pécsváradi's work we can read about sultan Selim I's campaign in 1516-1517, where he was an eye-witness.
Brother George of Hungary - or as he was earlier known, the Anonym of Szászsebes - became very popular throughout Europe.
As a student at the Dominicans of Szászsebes, the author was captured by the Turks in Transylvania in 1438, and set down in writing his memories and the experiences he gained throughout 20 years of captivity. He wrote his work, entitled 'Essay about the Traditions, Circumstances and Cruelties of the Turks' in Rome, in Latin. It was so popular that it was published seven times between 1480 and 1514, and was also translated into German, too.
He gave a detailed description of the world of the conquering Ottomans and the miserable life of their prisoners.
He was very objective, respecting and accepting the religious patience and humanity of the Muslims.
Theological Literature
The most original author of medieval Hungarian theological literature was Andreas Pannonius, a member of the Carthausian order of mute brethren.
Although he spent his life in Italian monasteries, as one of the warriors of John Hunyadi he never lost his interest in his homeland.
He dedicated one of his works to King Matthias.
His most outstanding work was a commentary to the 'Song of Songs', which was written in 1460, but he continuously worked on it until his death.
Within the boundaries of scholastic and mystic conceptions he created an original work of art, which brought great respect for Hungarian theological literature.
Nicolaus de Mirabilibus was a member of the Dominican order, who also spent the major part of his life in Italy. However, from 1494 he became the superior of the Hungarian Dominican order.
During his years in Italy, where he worked as a lecturer at university and as a preacher, he wrote an essay on conscience in Italian, then a Latin work on predestination.
Both authors used enormous amount of theological source material for their works.
Sermons
Preaching is a special genre of church literature: on one hand it spreads religion and teaches, and on the other hand it serves as the basis for the development of literature in the mother tongue.
Collections appeared partly anonymously, partly with an indication of the names of the authors.
Between 1456 and 1470 a priest from the region of Pécs compiled a collection entitled 'Sermones dominicales' [Sunday Preachings], which was based mainly on the preaching of Jacob Voragine.
His work spread in manuscripts with Hungarian glossas.
Compiling collections of sermons flourished and became significant throughout Europe among observant Franciscans in the second half of the 15th century.
Pelbárt Temesvári collected his sermons for his colleagues in the order, and he planned his texts as drafts, not as speeches.
He built up his preaching according to a scholastic logical order, and he supported his reasons with enormous quantities of quotations from church fathers and medieval experts.
To capture the attention of the audience and illustrate the subject he used moral parables from his own life or other collections of parables.
Pelbárt Temesvári's young colleague was Osvát Laskai.
He also published hundreds of sermons. In the prologue of his collection of sermons for Sundays he informed the readers that his aim was to help village priests and educate simple people.
He emphasised the consciousness of the individual and his commitments to ideas.
In contrast with Temesvári, his speeches were original owing to his sensitivity to social and national consciousness.
He often criticised social groups that did not make any sacrifice to holy purposes, and he tried to protect the poor.
As a new element of national consciousness, developing from the 13th century, he expanded the Hun-Hungarian identity to the whole nation, and declared that the Hungarian nation was the shield of Christian Europe.
He drew attention to the Turkish threat and the internal, ethnic-religious divide of the country.
He intended to strengthen the identity of the members of the order, when he undertook to continue the Franciscan chronicle and dealt with the heroic life of John Kapisztrán.
The works of the two Franciscan authors were published in several editions, and had a major influence on Europe.
Hagiography
When John Kapisztrán died on 23 December, 1456 in the cell of the Franciscan monastery of market town Újlak in the Szerémség, an enormous crowd of people set out on a pilgrimage to his catafalque, and many more people came after the funeral.
There were a lot of miraculous recoveries among people seeking a cure for their illnesses at the tomb of the Franciscan, who was regarded as a saint.
The authorities of the town had these miracles recorded in minutes in 1460 with the intention of encouraging the canonisation of John Kapisztrán.
The pilgrims attributed 389 recoveries and ten miraculous escapes from Turkish captivity to the honour and help of the saint Franciscan brother.
Apart from the list of miracles at Újlak, Peter Soproni, a Franciscan monk, tried to summarise the miracles in connection with John Kapisztrán and Osvát Laskai wrote his biography.
Laskai's work was lost, but Peter Soproni's work was published in print in 1523.
The relics of hermit St Paul of Téba, the patron saint of the Paulian order, were brought back to Budaszentlõrinc at the end of the 14th century, and consequently the central monastery of the Paulians also became a shrine.
There were a lot of miracles among people who hoped for a recovery from the relics, and these miracles were collected and published in print by Valentine Hadnagy in Krakow in 1507.
The well-known Paulian author also dealt with publishing the biography of hermit St Paul which was finally completed in 1511 in Venice.
Late medieval hagiographic literature had a double aim: they wanted to emphasise Christian consciousness with the ideal of the hero saint, who had died in the struggle against the Turks, and through ancient Christian examples they wanted to strengthen monastic self analysis.
For both purposes they used the most modern means to spread literature, that is by printing books.
A collection, the aim of which was to publish the legends of Hungarian saints not included in the Legenda aurea ('Legenda sanctorum Hungariae') was published several times after the 1486 Strassbourgh edition.
Scientific and Educational Literature
The Archbishop of Esztergom, Ladislaus Szalkai, who came from a simple family, was one of the most educated prelates of his period, who also wrote poetry and sermons. He did not study at foreign universities, but in the Augustine school of Sárospatak.
The memories of his student years at Sárospatak were the school notes of the late archbishop.
Under the directorship of baccalaureus John Kisvárdai in 1489-1490 he recorded the only school book of music theory in medieval Hungary, which could have been used at any of the contemporary universities - as far as its quality was concerned.
Besides music theory, the Szalkai codex contains notes about astronomy, church law and rhetoric, but these are less independent works.
At the end of the 15th century in Germany George of Hungary - who gained a magister's degree at one of the universities - compiled a handbook of aritmethic.
In his work he used money from around the Utrecht region, but in the appendix he also gave the rates of exchange of Hungarian money.
His work was printed in 1499.
Poetry
The appearance of humanism was strongly felt in the forms and content of poetry.
Liturgical poetry was still popular, but the characteristic features of this genre were rather the Hungarian language and the following antique forms.
The authors of liturgical poetry were, of course, monks, primarily Paulian monks.
Anthony Tatai, the preacher of the Budaszentlõrinc monastery, who published a Paulian service book and a breviary containing the texts of the office in the 1470s, studied at the university of Vienna.
His colleague in the order, Adalbert Csanádi, who was described in Gregor Gyöngyösi's history of the order as an outstanding preacher, wrote hymns about angels and angelic messages for feasts.
Besides these he wrote the verse-prayer of the patron saint of the order, hermit St Paul in hexametric lines, under the influence of humanism. The accompanying hymns were written in Sapphic verses.
The St Ladislaus Song, written by an unknown author in late Gothic style, might have originated from the 1460/1470s. It had a very interesting content.
The author added a new content to the hymnic form: in connection with the figure of Ladislaus he referred to the 'royal successor of the Huns', which must have reminded his contemporaries of Attila, the king of the Huns. It helped to spread the Hun-Hungarian identity, which can also be found in Osvát Laskai's sermons, and the works of John Turóczy and Stephen Werbõczy.
Political aspects forced the author to use anachronistic elements. For example, the hero had to fight the Turks and Hussite heresy.
So the hymn of the saint king became the tool of supporting king Matthias, but it did not influence the literary value of the work.
Its Hungarian translation was a real artistic work itself. In spite of its weaknesses it proved that medieval Latin was the nurse of literature in the mother tongue.
HUMANIST LITERATURE
The Preliminaries of the Appearance of Humanism in Hungary
At the turn of the 14-15th centuries a new late medieval movement appeared in Florence, the aim of which was to renew the Latin language - which had deteriorated in the Middle Ages - on the basis of newly discovered antique sources. This new movement also wanted to renew the whole culture and was initiated by Francesco Petrarc.
This spiritual trend was called humanism (as it was created by the humanists) or renaissance (as its aim was to encourage the "rebirth of literature" [renascentes litterae]). It opened a new phase in European culture, having created the basis of modern education.
It grew and developed in the 15th century in Italy, where the people considered themselves the real successors of ancient Rome and the Latin language.
It also gained ground in other European countries in the 16th century, and as far as literature was concerned it encouraged the use of national vernaculars.
Hungary came into contact with the new culture relatively early, compared to other European countries.
King Sigismund's Buda castle, (which was also an imperial residence) was frequently visited by outstanding humanists (for example, Francesco Filelfo, Ambrogio Travesari) as Italian ministers. Hungarian scholars were also able to get acquainted with humanist ideas and their representatives (for example, Poggio Bracciolini) at international forums, when they accompanied the king on his trips.
The Hungarians who studied in Italy and the Italians who got their high social status from King Sigismund (such as Scolari of Florence) also had a great influence on Hungarian culture.
The great humanist, Pier Paolo Vergerio, also played an important role in the transplantation of humanism. In his last years he had been one of the closest friends of János Vitéz.
John Vitéz, the "Father of Hungarian Humanism"
John Vitéz, who called himself Ioannes de Zredna because of his birthplace, started his career in King Sigismund's chancellery, then gradually rose to the peak of secular and ecclesiastical life in Hungary (becoming King Matthias's chief royal chancellor and the Archbishop of Esztergom).
Although he had no formal education he educated himself throughout his life.
His knowledge was outstanding in many respects and besides his literary duties, he dealt with astronomy and astrology, history, moral philosophy and philology.
He corrected (emendated) his own Latin codices.
He was a very close friend and colleague of the "apostle of Central-European humanism", Enea Silvio Piccolomini (later Pope Pius II).
He took care of the education of the Hunyadi sons, and played a great role in making Matthias king of Hungary.
However, later he led the plot against Matthias, and died in 1472.
He did not have any independent literary ambitions, the majority of his letters and his rhetoric speeches were made as a result of necessity concerning his political career.
His Book of Letters was the first Hungarian scholarly work from the age of humanism. He wrote it in collaboration with Paul Ivanich.
The most important topic of his rhetoric speeches (orations) was to encourage his audience to join forces against the Turks, which was also the greatest problem for his fellow humanists in Italy. This was supplemented with the description of the sufferings of the Hungarian people and their willingness to make sacrifices. He also asked for help from the peoples of Europe.
In both genres of his writings he mixed medieval type rhetoric with humanist elements, such as adoptions and paraphrases from his earlier readings.
In Hungary his works were considered as examples, but foreigners also respected them.
Feeling sorry for the lack of education among his fellow-citizens, János Vitéz took the responsibility to spread, organise and support humanist culture in Hungary.
His bishopric library in Várad was often visited by foreigners, and he set up a humanist library in Esztergom, with which he set an example for King Matthias's library, Bibliotheca Corvina.
He also supported the foundation of the first Hungarian book printing house, and established a university in Pozsony, called Universitas Histropolensis.
He supported the foreign humanists - especially Italians - who were involved in writing and dedicated their works to him.
He formed the precedents of Hungarian Humanist Academies in Várad, then Esztergom.
He sent several talented young men to study in Italy, who received high positions back in Hungary with his help.
Such persons were Peter Garázda and Ladislaus Vetési, and his famous nephew, Janus Pannonius.
Janus Pannonius
Janus Pannonius (his original name was János Chesmiczei) was the first outstanding figure in Hungarian literature, the founder of Hungarian secular poetry based on literary education, and the first great figure of European humanist poetry outside Italy.
He was born to a noble family in 1434 in Chesmicze.
He studied in Ferrara, in Guarino Veronese's school (1447-1454), at the expense of his famous uncle, János Vitéz. Later he studied law in Padua.
After his return home (1458) he followed a successful career: he became the Bishop of Pécs, King Matthias's chief treasurer and the ban of Slavonia.
When he was forced to flee - owing to the fact that he took part in the plot against the king - he fell ill and died in 1472 in Medvevár.
He became famous for his translations of poems and prose from Greek into Latin and he was a significant representative of humanist letter writing.
During his school years in Ferrara Janus Pannonius was prominent in poetry and became famous in Italy; as he himself wrote he was "the first of Pannonia to be honoured".
He wrote elegies and panegyricuses (cf. Claudius Claudianus), but his most famous works were his virtuosic epigrams. In his epigrams he imitated Martialis.
His sources were his own experiences in connection with literature, poets, everyday life and his readings.
The tone of his epigrams is either praising or satirical; he praised virtue, knowledge, the ability to create and great deeds, and he was satirical about human stupidity and dishonesty.
His erotic epigrams, the majority of which are also satirical, are still very popular.
His most outstanding praising epigrams are the ones written about himself and his importance.
He had great self-confidence, since he was aware of his own poetic values and greatness.
He wrote excellent epigrams about his teacher, Guarino, whom he loved and adored very much, as if he were his own father.
He began his Guarino panegyricus in Ferrara, in which he remembered him with great respect.
In his erotic epigrams he made fun of the lascivious, perverted and sensual people of his neighbourhood.
He wrote the poem About his Age (De aetate sua) when he was 16, in which he wrote about his experiences of becoming an adult man.
He hardly ever praised women, hiding his romantic feelings, but his poem To Agnes (Ad Agnetem) is the first example of Hungarian individual love poetry.
He wrote only a few poems in Padua, but his longest poem was written there (Marcello panegyricus).
In his Hungarian period his main genre was elegy, but he also wrote some epigrams.
He described political and military events, and wrote about his solitude and anti-war feelings.
The most significant poem of his Hungarian period is Farewell to Várad (Abiens valere iubet sanctos reges Waradini), in which he described the winter Hungarian landscape and the natural, cultural and spiritual values of Várad.
In his elegy To Borbala's Death he wrote about his mother's death and his love and mourning.
He often wrote about his own suffering.
In the elegy When He Got Ill in the Camp (De se aegrotante in castris) he bid farewell to life and composed his own epitaph and poetic greatness.
In one of his last elegies, To His Own Soul (Ad animam suam) - in which he gives account of his Neoplatonic philosophical studies (cf. Marsilio Ficino) - we can find the motif of death and the disillusionment of mankind.
In another one (The Flood; De inundatione) he had the apocalyptic vision of a flood, which would destroy the world.
His other favourite allegory was the allegory of the tree, which appeared in his Hungarian poems Of a Trasdanubian Almond Tree (De amygdalo in Pannonia nata) and The Fruit Tree.
The early blossoms of a fruit tree were frozen in the Pannonian winter, the other one is full of fruits, which are hit off by thick sticks rather than picked by hands.
King Matthias and Humanist Education
János Vitéz involved his student, King Matthias, in his organising activities, Italian connections and patronage. After putting down and recovering from the plot led by Vitéz, the king himself took charge of developing and controlling humanist culture in the country.
King Matthias was very intelligent, he was quite familiar with humanist studies and certain sciences (such as astronomy and alchemy). His high level of education was praised by his contemporaries.
The majority of letters composed in his name was written by Hungarian humanists in his chancellery, but he himself also composed and dictated letters.
According to the aesthetic norms of humanist letter writing, his letters were purposeful, well-composed, clear and free from decorations, and they reflect Matthias' royal merits.
After marrying Beatrix of Aragon (in 1476) King Matthias started to realise his great plan, to "make Hungary a second Italy" (Bonfini).
The royal court became the residence of Hungarian humanism, where foreign, mostly Italian scientists worked carrying out the king's wishes.
Neoplatonism was the influential philosophy of the court, and owing to direct and close ties Matthias established a branch of the Florence Academy in Buda.
Latin translations from Greek and Italian works praising King Matthias and his deeds, humanist dialogues (for example, Aurelio Brandolini Lippo's works) were written there.
The most important result of literary and scientific work was the birth of modern Hungarian historiography.
The king entrusted Antonio Bonfini with recording Hungarian history from a humanist perspective.
The historiographer adopted Thuróczy's chronicle supplemented with several documents and living traditions.
He used witnesses and his own experiences as sources in describing the age.
Events of Hungarian history were shown as part of universal history, using a lot of ancient sources.
Until the 19th century information about the past of the Hungarian people originated from Bonfini's work, both in Hungary and abroad.
Galeotto Marzio's booklet about Matthias was as popular as Bonfini's. He wrote down his experiences in regard to the king and his family, Hungarian traditions and culture and his Hungarian friends in anecdote-like short stories.
One of his closest friends was Michael Báthory.
One of King Matthias's greatest achievements was the establishment of his famous library, the Bibliotheca Corvinian.
It was one of the biggest secular libraries of the world at that time with its 2000-2500 books. Only the Vatican library was bigger in terms of the number of its books.
As it was a humanist library - just like John Vitéz's earlier - it was very valuable.
This means that the king collected ancient works of literature, that is all the translations from Greek and Latin including patristic literature.
The library had very few printed books, it was more a collection of precious codices.
These were copied or checked by scientist who spoke Greek and Latin, and were then decorated by the finest Italian and Hungarian book painters. Finally, the specially decorated bounds and plates were made by outstanding masters.
Today only 216 original corvinas are known from this great library.
Humanist Literature from the Jagello age
After the death of King Matthias nobody continued his great deeds and initiatives.
The majority of the Italians moved away from the court. Their places were occupied by the Czechs and Moravians who supported King Ulaslo II, and people from Vienna, with whom relations became closer.
The thing which most attracted the humanists was still the Corvina library.
Although the number of books did not increase (the 150 codices which were ordered by King Matthias from Vespasiano da Bisticci's Florence workshop did not arrive in Hungary), many codices were lent or even given away, the uniqueness and richness of the library - for example, the priceless Greek and Latin codices - was unrivalled in Europe, and it was an extraordinary place for literary and scientific work.
During Ulaslo II's reign the leaders of court humanism were the Czech and Moravian humanists.
They worked in the royal chancellery in Buda, and also oriented towards Vienna, which became another famous humanist centre alongside Italy.
Their leaders were two outstanding European humanists: Augustinus Moravus from Olomouc and Bohuslav Hasistejnsky z Lobkoovic, the greatest Czech humanist poet.
The first great German humanist poet, Konrad Celtis, based his academy, the Danubian Scientific Association (Sodalitas Litteraria Danubiana) - the centre of which was in Vienna - on foreign humanists living in Hungary. Its members were Central-European humanists.
They chose John Vitéz Jnr., the Bishop of Veszprém, to be their president, and members from Buda were able to hold their meetings as an individual group (contubernium) as well.
The ideas and works of Erasmus of Roterodamus began to spread in Hungary towards the end of King Louis II's reign (1516-1526) and they also gained the approval of the royal couple.
Humanist culture reached the outer circles of society, too, such as the lower priests and citizens of towns.
The leaders of humanist education and the disseminators of this modern culture were members of the Hungarian church elite.
Though they could not compete with the Bishop of Eger, Hippolit Estei (Ippolito d'Este), Hungarian prelates (for example, George Szatmári, Francis Várdai) also collected and read the books of ancient and humanist authors and (George Handó founded a humanist library in Pécs), and supported talented young people in their studies and surrounded themselves with humanist writers.
In the Jagello age the main interest and the aim of the activities of the Hungarian humanists was to collect, publish and evaluate the manuscript of Janus Pannonius's works.
Foreign scholars also took part in the Janus philology, partly because of their Hungarian students and supporters, and partly because of the poet's international fame and greatness.
From among the Hungarians poets, especially Sebastian Magyi and Adrian Wolphardus helped the publishing of Janus's works.
They considered Janus their model, and spread national self-confidence and pride through his works.
The most outstanding Hungarian philologist of the age was Matthaeus Fortunatus, who published a Seneca edition which became famous throughout Europe (1523).
The most important part of literature was poetry, and Hungarian authors introduced new genres in it.
The poet Jacobus Piso was highly respected by his contemporaries, and was Erasmus's first Hungarian friend.
Stephanus Taurinus wrote an epic poem on a Hungarian topic, remembering the Dózsa peasant revolt of 1514 in his poem Stauromachia.
This had a great influence on Martin Nagyszombati, who encouraged Hungarian noblemen to unite and defend themselves against the Turks in his poem To the Hungarian Noblemen (Ad regni Hungariae proceres), which was written after the defeat at Nándorfehérvár (1521).
Valentine Hagymási was also a talented poet, whose poem praising the beauty and richness of Hungary is worth mentioning besides his classic, frequently quoted 'declamatio', The Praise and Reproval of Wine and Water (De laudibus et vituperio vini et aquae).
Bartholomeus Francofordinus Pannonius was a talented poet, who introduced humanist comedy with his writing The Cricket (Gryllus).
In regard to Jagello age prose the most popular genre was the humanist letter; and the most well-known author of this genre was Peter Váradi, who collected his letters written between 1490 and 1497 in a book called Letterbook.
The above mentioned works are not outstanding ones, but they show that the demand for Latin humanist literature increased significantly in Hungary.
This process - and also philology, which drew people's attention to their mother tongue - created the circumstances among which Hungarian renaissance literature could be born.
ARTS
HISTORY OF ART
Art in Hungary Between 1437 and 1476
After Sigismund's death the seat of Austrian princes and heirs to the imperial throne, Vienna became the most important cultural and political centre in Central Europe.
At the 1459 lodge conference of Regensburg the master of the building lodge of the Viennese Stephanskirche, Laurentz Spenyng considered Hungary to come under his authority.
This was not only a formal demand, since we know from the history of art that the Viennese style was widespread in Hungary, but local traditions of the age of Sigismund were also discernible in the art of the period.
In fine arts there was a significant change in the 1440s: the former soft style was replaced with a new, realistic one which appeared in Western-European, especially in Netherlandish artistic centres.
This was transmitted to Hungary by way of the South-German and Austrian territories.
The leading style of this period in this region was the so-called hard style.
Castles in the Middle of the 15th Century
In the chaotic, troublesome years after Albert's death, a lot of older castles were fortified.
In Kisnána the Kompolthis incorporated into their new castle not only their former curia but also the parish church of the village.
This example was followed by the Újlakis in Várpalota, but here a representative form was used with four corner towers.
During the same time, the Marótis added new wings and a chapel to their castle in Gyula to make it more commodious.
The Archbishop of Kalocsa, Stephen Váradi protected his residence at Bács from the imminent Turkish attacks with an enormous fortress.
John Hunyadi first fortified his residence at Vajdahunyad, then enlarged it by the addition of a chapel and a new palace wing including two large rooms one above the other.
Certain characteristic moulding forms indicate that French masters may have worked on these constructions.
A similarly splendid great hall decorated with a row of balconies was started in Esztergom by the Archbishop Denis Szécsi, and continued by his successor, John Vitéz.
Building of Village Churches in the Middle of the 15th Century
In Vas county, on the estates of Monyorókerék (Eberau, Austria) of the Ellerbach family a characteristic late Gothic brick architecture developed parallel with the art of the neighbouring Austrian territories.
A typical example of this is the church of Szentpéterfa.
In the eastern part of the country John Hunyadi's building activities are relevant from the same period.
On his estate in Debrecen, a hall church with a large ambulatory was erected.
In Transylvania the Franciscan church of Tövis (Teius) was built for him by the mason Conrad of Brassó.
Similar to this puritan structure was the parish church of Vingárt, built by John Geréb of Vingárt, a relative of the Hunyadi family.
These buildings had stone walls with few carved stone elements in them.
Church Building in Part of the Country in the Middle of the 15th Century
According to the date inscribed on a stone that bears King Matthias' coat of arms, in one of the tower windows, the construction of the southern tower of the parish church of Our Lady of Buda was completed in 1470.
The walls of the high, octagonal upper part of the tower, which included three floors, were perforated by pointed windows with deep and moulded frames.
In the central region of the country there were only minor constructions in this period.
A typical example is the reconstruction of the St George chapel next to the cathedral of Veszprém, which was transformed by the Bishop Albert Vetési into his own tomb chapel.
He had a tower-shaped late Gothic tabernacle added to the southern part of the apse, whose corbel bears the name of the builder, his coat of arms and the date: 1467.
This inscription is the oldest record in Hungary written in "antiqua" style letters.
The portal of the chapel was also replaced by a new, representative one of red marble, crowned by a gable and framed by pinnacles.
The Architecture of Pozsony in the Middle of the 15th Century
The death of King Sigismund did not slow down the development of big towns, which had become important in the preceding decades.
The most significant work in Pozsony was the completion of the nave and aisles of the parish church, where the vaulting of the side aisles is closely related to the vault of the nave in the Stephanskirche of Vienna, built by Hans Puchspaum.
The plans for the vault of the Pozsony church have also been preserved in Vienna. They were almost certainly made by Puchspaum himself, and built by stonemasons from Vienna.
Lorentz Spenning, the leader of the Viennese lodge corresponded with the city after 1456.
The works on the new chancel of the church started at that time, but progressed very slowly.
The final consecration of this part of the building took place only in 1497.
Kassa and North-East Hungary in the Middle of the 15th Century
The construction of the St Elisabeth parish church of Kassa was directed by a workshop whose members previously worked in Vienna.
The vault of the church was completed before 1440.
The star vaults follow Viennese prototypes, and also appear in another building in Kassa, in the chancel of the Franciscan church. After 1440 the west gallery and the southern tower were completed, and side-chapels were added to the church.
The construction of the St Elisabeth church must have been directed by a city architect called István.
He also built the new vaulting and the tabernacle in the chancel of the parish church of Bártfa (Bardejov, Slovakia).
The new main chancel of the parish church of Kassa was built at the same time as the western parts, but was executed by masters trained in southern Germany.
The Architecture of Upper Hungary in the Middle of the 15th Century
The towns and market towns in Upper (Northern) Hungary transformed their parish churches into representative three-vessel hall- or pseudo-basilican structures with late Gothic net vaults.
During the reconstruction of the parish church of Csetnek new vaults were made and a chancel with three apses was started.
In Gyöngyöspata also a three-vessel pseudo-basilical building of rather low proportions was built with star vaults.
In the Szepesség (Spi region, Slovakia) the parish church of Késmárk (Kezmarok, Slovakia) received a wide chancel with a net vault, and the collegiate church of the Szepes was very similar.
The chapel built by Imre Szapolyai by the side of the parish church of Csütörtökhely (Spisky tvrtok, Slovakia) in the Szepesség is outstanding in the region on account of its high quality.
The plans of this two-storey building originated from the Viennese lodge.
The Architecture of Transylvanian Towns in the Middle of the 15th Century
In the towns of Transylvania the former large-scale church constructions were continued.
These preserved much from the local forms of the late Sigismund age.
The western facade of the St Michael church of Kolozsvár (Cluj) was completed at the same time as the portal.
The vaulting was executed afterwards.
The bottom of the southern tower received its final form when the chapel of the parish priest Gregor Schleuning was completed.
In Brassó (Brasov) a splendid entrance hall was erected in front of the south-eastern portal of the parish church.
An enormous entrance hall called ferula was raised in front of the western facade of the parish church of Nagyszeben.
In Szászsebes (Sebes) the 13th-century side aisles were rebuilt.
Sculpture in the Middle of the 15th Century
Besides the simple and traditional tombstones, the aristocrats and the prelates usually had full-figure tombstones made in this period (for example, the tombstones of the younger John Hunyadi in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Rumania), of George Bazini Szentgyörgyi ( 1467) and of Denis Szécsi, Archbishop of Esztergom ( 1465).
The tombstone of George Schönberg, dean of Pozsony (Bratislava) and the chancellor of the Pozsony university, is of outstanding quality and shows a stylistic relationship with the sculpture of Nicolaus Gerhaerts and Hans Multscher, representatives of the hard style.
Another important master of this style was Jacob of Kassa, who was of Hungarian origin but worked in the German-speaking territories.
The characteristic features of the hard style, which replaced the soft style, can be seen on the first Madonna of Tüskevár carved in the middle of the 15th century.
Altar Art in the Middle of the 15th Century
In the middle of the 15th century winged altarpieces became widespread throughout the country. They consisted of movable wings and a central case.
The simpler pieces were made of painted panels crowned by a row of painted triangular gables.
A typical work of this type is the altarpiece of Mateóc (Matejovce) in the Szepesség (Spi region, Slovakia) painted by an artist who also worked in Lesser Poland.
The altarpiece of Liptószentmária (Liptovská Mara, Slovakia) also has close ties with the art of Poland.
The high altar of the Transylvanian Almakerék (Mãlîncrav) represents a type of winged altars enriched by carved gables.
The master of another Transylvanian altarpiece, the high altar of Prázsmár (Prejmer), also used elements of Netherlandish painting in his work.
An example of the richest altar form with statues is the St Barbara altarpiece of Bártfa (Bardejov, Slovakia).
According to the usual arrangement of the type of altarpiece known as Viereraltar the central figure, here a Madonna, is surrounded by the figures of four small saints.
The statues and painted panels of the altarpiece all represent the hard style.
Book Painting in the Middle of the 15th Century
The influence of the Viennese style also made itself felt in book illumination.
The Viennese master Michael decorated the special volume of Donatus' Grammatica made for Ladislaus V.
Another Viennese master named after his work on Maximilian of Habsburg's school book - the so-called Lehrbüchermeister - illuminated the register of Hungarian students at the university of Vienna, then decorated for King Matthias the so-called Franciscan missale with the king's portrait.
The greatest bibliophile of the age was John Vitéz, who ordered numerous codices from Florentine workshops.
Among the charters of donations of coats of arms there were more Hungarian works than foreign ones.
The charter of the Bod family of Bodfalva was painted in 1460 in Buda.
The charter of the town of Késmárk (Kezmarok, Slovakia) donating a seal to the town, is one of the most outstanding examples of a Hungarian painting of coats-of-arms.
But the 1459 charters of coats of arms of the Szentgyörgyi and Bazini families, counts of the Holy Roman Empire, were made in Vienna.
Minor Arts in the Middle of the 15th Century
The most outstanding piece of metalwork from the period is a chalice with filigree enamel decoration, which was given to the cathedral of Gyulafehérvár by the Transylvanian nobleman Benedict Suky.
A viaticum box for the Host, with carved mother-of-pearl and filigree enamel decoration, was the product of the same Transylvanian workshop that made the Suky chalice.
Also monstrances resembling the grand Gothic altars became widespread in this period. The most beautiful example of these was the one in the St Martin church of Pozsony (Bratislava, Slovakia).
Bronze baptismal fonts were also part of the usual church equipment.
The older, traditional forms were usually preserved on these, as can be seen on the baptismal fonts of the parish churches in Késmárk (Kezmarok) in the Szepesség or in Brassó in Transylvania.
The most beautiful piece among seals was King Matthias's royal seal and golden bull, which he began to use at his coronation in 1464.
Art in Hungary Between 1476 and 1526
King Matthias became a significant art patron only after his marriage to Beatrix.
In the beginning his buildings followed the late Gothic Viennese style towards which earlier architecture was oriented.
In the first half of the 1480s, when Italian artists settled in Hungary, also Renaissance elements appeared on his most important buildings at Visegrád.
In the second half of the 1480s there was a major change in style.
The late Gothic style of Saxon origin reached Hungary through Silesia and Poland and became prevalent in the eastern and central parts of the country.
At the same time, however, the Italian Renaissance exerted a strong influence on the architecture, sculpture and book illumination of the court in Buda.
These two styles developed side by side in the Jagello age as well, but were no longer confined to the art of the court.
The first entirely Renaissance buildings appeared around 1500, and the Italian style spread in all fields of art throughout the country. Nevertheless, the parallel use of the late Gothic and Renaissance styles remained characteristic during the whole period.
Visegrád and its Architectural Connections in the Late Matthias Period
King Matthias started the constructions at Visegrád after 1476.
These were directed by the provisors (provisores curiae) of Buda.
The royal palace became a magnificent country residence during the next decade.
The buildings from the Sigismund age were modernised: the window and door frames, ceilings, balconies, loggias, and fountains were all replaced by new late Gothic structures occasionally mixed with Renaissance elements.
Italian stone carvers carved the Hercules fountain and the fountain of the Muses, the furnishings of the chapel, and the loggia in the interior courtyard in Renaissance style.
The late Gothic architectural workshop also worked on the citadel.
The work of the same workshop, or at least its style, could be seen at other royal constructions, mainly on estates under the authority of the provisors of Buda such as the castles of Tata and Zsámbék, or at the rebuilding of the castle of Vajdahunyad (Hunedoara, Rumania) and the monastery building of the abbey of Pannonhalma, also rebuilt under the commandership of the provisors of Buda.
The palace building of Urban Nagylucsei, bishop of Gyõr, also followed the style of the constructions at Visegrád.
Buda in the Late Matthias Period
During the rebuilding of the Buda castle in the second half of the 1480s, King Matthias had the buildings from the Sigismund period renovated.
The palace chapel was entirely refurnished, and the Corvina library was moved to the rooms of the adjacent eastern wing.
Bronze statues and representative fountains were set up to decorate the courtyards.
In the west wing of the inner courtyard a large hall was created on the second floor and a two-storey loggia raised on the arcades on the ground floor.
The entrance of the eastern wing of the Sigismund-period courtyard was decorated with red marble stairs and a decorative double portal.
The Italian Renaissance played an important role here.
Matthias had the big cistern on the southern part of the castle rebuilt, and a hanging garden created above it after Italian examples.
There was a garden in the western side of the Castle Hill.
The constructions were not finished in Matthias' lifetime, and continued under Wladislas II's reign.
The Spread of the Renaissance in the 1480s-1490s
Nicholas Báthory, Bishop of Vác and one of the best educated humanists among the Hungarian prelates, was building his castles in Nógrád in 1483 and Vác in 1485, probably still in late Gothic style.
In 1489 he occupied the abbey of Mogyoród, on the site of which he later built a castle decorated with a Renaissance loggia.
At the same time he probably had another Renaissance loggia built in his palace in Vác.
The Bishop of Nagyvárad, John Filipec (1476-1491) had the episcopal palace of Várad (Oradea, Rumania) rebuilt.
The red marble Renaissance structures originating from Buda also appeared on these constructions together with late Gothic elements.
Cathedrals Rebuilt in Late Gothic Style at the End of the Matthias Age and in the Jagello Age
Bishop Osvat Laki Thuz had the vault of the chancel of the cathedral of Zagreb rebuilt by masters from Vienna.
One of the original designs for the vault can still be found among the plans of the Viennese lodge today.
The re-vaulting of the nave of the collegiate church in Székesfehérvár started in the first half of the 1480s. Then an enormous hall-chancel with an ambulatory was began, which in 1490 was still incomplete.
There were similar constructions in Eger, where Urban Nagylúcsei commissioned a new chancel, but this part of the building was still unfinished in 1539, and destroyed three years later.
North and East Hungary in the Late Matthias Age
At the end of the 15th century, several developing market towns in the eastern part of the country had large hall churches with ambulatories built for their parish churches, following the example of the churches in Pest, Szászsebes, Brassó, and Debrecen.
There are no data about the building of the St Bartholomew church of Gyöngyös and the St Demeter church of Szeged (the present-day Calvinist church), but the construction of the St Stephen church of Miskolc was dated in a charter and in an inscription to around 1489.
In the Szepesség building activities on the churches of Késmárk (Kezmarok) and Szepeshely (Spiská Kapitula) were continued.
In Szepeshely Stephen Szapolyai had a beautiful side-chapel added to the renewed church.
In Okolicsnó (Okolicné, Slovakia) in Liptó county the three-vessel hall church of the Franciscans was built with the support of Matthias and John Corvin.
The Architecture of the Transdanubia in the 1480s-1490s
A typical example for the residence of the growing number of big landowners was the complex of Ladislaus Egervári in Egervár, which comprised the castle, the Franciscan friary and church of the nearby Fancsika.
These buildings were built with shaped brick structures the use of which was widespread in Vas and Zala counties in the 15th century.
Paul Kinizsi established his residence in Nagyvázsony (castle, Paulian friary, parish church).
The late Gothic forms represented by the Nagyvázsony building complex became widespread in the whole region to the north of Lake Balaton.
A monument in this architectural group that survived largely intact is the parish church of Zalaszántó.
After 1490 Renaissance elements also appeared in some places.
The castle of Kõszeg, then occupied by Emperor Maximilian I, was also rebuilt. The Renaissance row of windows of the large hall date from this time.
Royal Constructions in Buda and Visegrád in the Jagello Age
Building activities in the Buda palace started by Matthias continued under Wladislas II.
Red marble, used in the Matthias age, was replaced by the yellowish Buda marl, which was discovered by the Italian stone carvers working there.
The Late Gothic style still played an important role at these constructions.
The most important example was probably the vault of the palace chapel, where three-dimensionally curved ribbed vaults were used. This type of vaulting was perfected by Benedict Ried, the architect of the royal palace in Prague.
The influence of Ried and his colleague in Prague, Hans Spiess, can be felt on the Franciscan friary rebuilt next to the Visegrád palace.
Among the carved stone fragments from the Buda palace some pieces survived which represent the late Gothic style of Saxon origin, widespread in the eastern part of the country from the 1490s on.
The Activity of the Nyék Workshop Around 1500
Wladislas II had the Nyék hunting lodge from Sigismund's time converted into a splendid Renaissance castle.
Near the church of the village two large buildings were raised. The main facade of the residential quarters was decorated with a two-storey loggia; the other building, partly of timber, was surrounded by a porch.
Moses Buzlai Gergellaki commissioned the workshop working in Nyék to make several carvings for his castle at Simontornya from Buda marl, including the Renaissance loggia along the courtyard of his castle.
Emeric Perényi set up his residence in Siklós, where he also employed masters who previously worked at Nyék.
The Late Gothic style had an important role in the construction of both castles.
The beautiful castle chapel of Siklós, which followed Saxon prototypes, is still standing.
The Architecture of Pécs in the Jagello Age
In the southern part of the country Pécs became an important artistic centre.
Bishop Sigismund Ernuszt had the castle and the city walls rebuilt and a new vault made in the cathedral.
The architect of the cathedral, master Demeter may have also built the star net vault of the Dominican church.
Ernuszt's successor, Bishop George Szatmári, was an important patron, and continued with the decoration of the cathedral, from which a red marble tabernacle has survived.
Besides the cathedral, he had the building of the chapter rebuilt and the episcopal palace reconstructed in Renaissance style.
Outside the city walls, at Tettye he had a Renaissance villa raised.
Primarily Dalmatian masters may have worked on these constructions.
Renaissance Constructions of Ecclesiastical Centres at the Beginning of the 16th Century
The castle of Bács was rebuilt by Peter Váradi, the Archbishop of Kalocsa.
The building was fortified with round corner towers and a barbican, and decorated with a late Gothic chapel and Renaissance palace wings.
The Renaissance rebuilding of the episcopal palace of Nagyvárad took place under Bishop Sigismund Thurzó.
At Gyulafehérvár canon John Lászai had a late Gothic chapel added to the side of the cathedral. The chapel had a net vault and its facade was decorated with Lombard Renaissance elements.
In Esztergom Archbishop Thomas Bakócz had a tomb chapel raised at the side of the basilica.
This red marble building, built on a cross-shaped ground-plan and with a metal dome structure, was the clearest example of high Renaissance architecture in Hungary.
Its white marble altar was carved by Andrea Ferrucci.
Bakócz's successor, Archbishop George Szatmári, had a new residence building raised in the inner part of the palace, to which a hanging garden decorated with a Renaissance loggia was added.
The Architecture of Buda and its Environs in the Jagello Age
At the constructions of the town of Buda several trends of the late Gothic style can be distinguished.
The two western bays and the western tower flanked by two chapels of the Mary Magdalene parish church show Viennese connections.
A similar tower was added to the parish church of Nagymaros.
The style of Saxon origin, present in the castle of Buda, can also be observed on the rebuilding of the Dominican St Michael church in Buda.
Both the vault of the nave and the tower, part of which is still standing, were also built at this time.
Near Buda, at the Paulians' main friary in Szentlõrinc, St Paul the Hermit's tomb chapel and his relic tomb carved by Brother Denis was finished, then the new chancel and the chapter room were built.
Transylvania in the Jagello Age
The region where the late Gothic style of Saxon origin was especially widespread was the eastern part of the country.
The nave and aisles of the former Franciscan friary in Farkas street in Kolozsvár were rebuilt by brother John after 1490.
The rich stone carvings and drawn-in buttresses that characterise this building also appear on the former Dominican friary of Kolozsvár.
Similar buttresses were used also at the parish church of Dés (Dej).
Related stone carvings can be found on the nave of the parish church of Ótorda (Turda) and on the parsonage of Nagyszeben (Sibiu).
This style was spread in the Saxon region of Transylvania by the stone carver Andrew of Nagyszeben, his most outstanding work being the parish church of Muzsna (Mosna).
The hall church of Berethalom (Biertan) was also very similar.
These and other Transylvanian churches were surrounded by thick walls and towers because of the repeated Turkish attacks.
The Architecture of North-East Hungary in the Jagello Age
The stylistic features of the late Gothic style of Saxonian origin can be observed on the side chapels of the parish church of Pest.
Probably contemporary with these are the two inscribed Renaissance tabernacles, and probably a Renaissance altar as well.
Later waves of Saxonian influence can be seen on the parish church of Nyírbátor, built by Andrew, son of Andrew Bátori. The church had a magnificent net vault and was decorated with Renaissance elements.
Perhaps Andrew Bátori's carved Madonna from 1526 was also created during this construction.
The late Gothic vault of the nave of the Franciscan church in Szeged, built well after the consecration of the building in 1503 but before 1543, is similar to that of Nyírbátor.
The Architecture of Upper Hungary in the Jagello Age
The one-vessel St Catherine church in Selmecbánya (Banská tiavnica), a mining town which became increasingly affluent from the late 15th century, was built and consecrated in the centre of the town.
On the hill above the town a large, three-vessel parish church was built.
At the edge of the town Erasmus Roessl built the rich vault with three dimensionally curving ribs for the chancel of the church of Our Lady of the Snow.
The most perfect Hungarian example of this special type of vaulting is the vault of an oratory in the parish church of Besztercebánya (Banská Bystrica), which is closely related to Anton Pilgram's works in Vienna.
In Sáros county the parish church of Eperjes (Preov) was rebuilt by Johannes Bregyssen in late Gothic style.
The surviving account books of this construction are unique records for the history of architecture of the period.
The nearby town of Bártfa (Bardejov) made a contract with master Alexius in 1507 for the construction of the town hall.
On this building late Gothic forms are already mixed with Renaissance elements.
Tomb Sculpture in Hungary in the late 15th and early 16th Centuries
The most splendid tombstones of the period were the full-figure knight and prelate tombstones.
The change of style from the late Gothic to the Renaissance in the last decades of the 15th century can be clearly seen on these.
In Szepeshely (Spiská Kapitula, Slovakia) the tombstone of Emeric Szapolyai ( 1487) was still decorated with late gothic elements, while the tombstone of Stephen Szapolyai from 1499 is already Renaissance.
In the 1490s a new type of Renaissance tombstone appeared, in the upper part of which there was a coat of arms; in the lower part, a field with inscription.
The earliest example of this type is a tombstone from Buda, made in 1496 for Bernardo Monelli, the castellan of the Queen's castle in Óbuda.
Around 1500 another variant of this new type appeared, in which the coat of arms was surrounded by a so-called Italian wreath, as on Nicholas Acatius Szentléleki's tombstone in Csatka from 1516.
Renaissance Sculpture in Hungary in the late 15th and early 16th Centuries
King Matthias decorated his palaces with works of art ordered from Italy.
One such piece was the tabernacle in his Visegrád palace chapel carved from Carrara marble.
Several Italian masters used Hungarian red marble at the court.
The leader of the workshop working on the Renaissance fountains of the Visegrád palace carved the marvellous sculpture of young Hercules fighting with the hydra of Lerna.
A lunette relief, known as the Visegrád Madonna, and the two supplementary putto reliefs are the work of a less talented Italian stone carver.
The two outstanding altar fragments from Carrara marble, found in the castle of Diósgyõr and the Paulian friary, are related to Giovanni Dalmata's works.
Tabernacles similar in structure to that in the Visegrád palace chapel became increasingly popular in Hungary in the 16th century.
Besides the ones in the parish church of Pest the most significant example of this type is George Szatmári's tabernacle in Pécs.
Wood Sculpture in Hungary in the late 15th and early 16th Centuries
A unique work of this period is the Easter sepulchre from Garamszentbenedek (Hrnosk Benadik, Slovakia).
The most monumental winged altars are also characteristic of this age.
A new high altar was set up in the St Elisabeth church in Kassa, the magnificent sculptures of which can be linked to the most modern trends of South-German sculpture.
The sculptor of the enormous carved high altar of the St James parish church in Lõcse (Levoca, Slovakia), Master Paul may have been trained in Veit Stoss's workshop in Cracow.
Stoss had a great influence on other artists as well, such as the sculptor of the St Barbara altar of Besztercebánya (Banská Bystrica, Slovakia).
The destroyed main altars from Pozsony and Selmecbánya, from which only a few sculptures survive, were related to contemporary trends of sculpture in the Bavarian territories.
Painting in Hungary in the late 15th and early 16th Centuries
While the central cases of large altars were decorated with sculptures, the wings consisted of painted panels.
Several altars from the same workshop have survived from the 1470-1480s in Garamszentbenedek and in the church of Jánosrét (Lúcky), near Körmöcbánya (Kremnica, Slovakia).
They are all characterised by a lively, realistic manner.
This realism originating from Netherlandish painting determines also the style of the high altar of the church in Medgyes (Medias, Rumania), painted by a master with Viennese experience.
After 1500 the Danube school became influential in Hungarian painting, exemplified by altars from Zólyomszászfalu (Sásová, Slovakia).
The most important painter of the age was Master MS, who painted the wings of the high altar of Selmecbánya.
Very little survives from the Renaissance painting of the period.
The most significant of these is a series of frescos of virtues in the studiolo of the Esztergom palace, where Queen Beatrix resided after 1490.
The vaults or wooden ceilings of churches were often decorated with late Gothic or Renaissance ornamentation.
Book Illumination
King Matthias enriched his Corvina library with books of Renaissance decoration bought in Italy, but he also set up a book copying and miniature workshop in Buda.
This workshop continued to function after Matthias' death, working for Wladislas II.
Private customers also followed the example of the rulers.
The breviary and other codices of Dominic Kálmáncsehi, dean of Székesfehérvár between 1474 and 1495, were decorated by Franciscus de Castello of Milan.
Simon Erdõdy's (Bishop of Zagreb, 1519-1543) Esztergom gradual or Francis Perényi's (Bishop of Várad, 1514-1526) Esztergom missal - this latter a Venetian incunabulum decorated with miniatures after its arrival in Hungary - were also represent the style of the Buda workshop.
Other works reflect the influence of German painting, as, for example, the miniatures of the Pannonhalma evangelistarium, which are based on the prints of Dürer and Schongauer. The influence of the traditions of late Gothic art can also be observed, for example on the decoration of the Kassa gradual in which late Gothic and Renaissance elements are mixed.
Charters for the Donation of Coats of Arms
The late Gothic traditions of the previous period can also be noticed in the decoration of charters of coats of arms in the late Matthias age.
Besides the miniatures of nobles' coats of arms, the backgrounds of which were decorated with rich late Gothic helmet covers (Nagylucsei, 1480; Ambrust 1518), coats of arms with Renaissance decorations were also becoming widespread from around 1500 (Pethõ Gersei, 1507).
The painters of the Buda miniature workshop also participated in decorating these: the painter of Simon Erdõdy's codices executed the coats of arms of Dorothy Kanizsai (1519) and of the Forgách family of Gyimes (1525).
Not only the rich Renaissance ornamentation of the frame decorations is worthy of attention, but also the realism of coats-of-arms (for example, Radák, 1514).
Textiles and Metalwork
The Hungarian coronation mitre richly decorated with late Gothic fittings and pearls was made in the second quarter of the 15th century.
The late 15th-century horn cup of Esztergom represents a typical late Gothic vessel form.
By this time Renaissance goldsmiths' work also appeared in Hungary: Matthias commissioned Lombard goldsmiths to make the Renaissance base of the so-called Matthias Calvary, then kept in the royal treasury.
A chasuble decorated with Italian Renaissance embroidery was part of the equipment of Archbishop Thomas Bakócz's tomb chapel in Esztergom.
The tradition of filigree enamel decorations continued in Hungary in the 16th century, too; a high quality work with this technique is chalice of Thomas Bakócz.
One of the most beautiful pieces of late Gothic metalwork in Hungary is the monstrance from Németjárfalva, which may once have belonged to the Poor Clares of Óbuda.
Majolica, Glass
Matthias and Beatrix ordered several sets of colourfully painted majolica dishes with white tin glaze from Italy, and even invited masters to Buda who established a majolica workshop there.
The majolica floor tiles of the Buda and Visegrád royal residences and of the episcopal palace of Vác were made there.
Soon another majolica workshop was founded in Pécs.
Not only from Italy were decorative dishes imported to Hungary but also from Moravian (Lostice) and German (Dreihausen, Siegburg) territories, from where hard ceramics were arrived by trade.
Besides the import of crystal clear and paper-thin glass vessels from Venice, also Hungarian glass was produced from the second half of the 15th century. The Hungarian glassworks copied Venetian forms, but their thick, greenish glass products were far below the quality of the workshops of Murano.
Stoves, Furniture, and Hangings in the Matthias and Jagello Age
For the decoration of the royal palaces built in the late Matthias period new types of late Gothic stoves were erected.
Perhaps the so-called knight-figure stove was originally made for Frederick III, but the stove with Matthias' coats of arms was definitely made for the king himself.
Stoves with multicoloured tiles came into fashion during this period.
The representative stoves and their copies were found not only in the royal residences, but also in private castles and manor houses.
Of the furniture of the period mainly church furnishings have survived.
The choir stalls from the parish church of Bártfa (Bardejov, Slovakia) are late Gothic in style.
The Renaissance stalls with wood intarsia from the Franciscan church of Nyírbátor were made in the Florentine Marone workshop.
From the 15th-century hangings only King Matthias' throne hanging has survived, designed probably by Antonio Pollaiuolo in the 1470s.
HISTORY OF MUSIC
From the Beginning of the 15th century to the Battle of Mohács
From the point of view of the history of music the period spanning the 14 and 15th centuries was the beginning of a new era.
The western European orientation of the Angevine kings led to the flourishing of intellectual life (including music) in Hungary.
Although the network of towns appeared somewhat later, and thus did not allow for a significant concentration of intellectuals - as happened in the west - the bourgeoisie became an important social group in the country, and this fact had positive consequences in music practise and teaching.
There are a lot of musical data from the Middle Ages with reference to Gregorian songs and some polyphonic memories, and in addition to musical notations in manuscripts it is possible to read about the everyday practise of music. For example, we know about the songs of paid student groups at foundation masses and weekend services, or musical service next to a holy tomb, or music services at funerals.
Musical Life in the Church
In this period communal singing in the mother tongue also became popular alongside solemn liturgical (Gregorian) songs (first of all under the influence of Franciscan and Dominican monks).
However, the Paulian order also had a flourishing musical-liturgical life - from the 14th century - which was equivalent to that of the communal chapters.
It was typical, for example, that the number of monks participating in the service in Budaszentlõrinc was more than a hundred in the 15th century.
In this monastic order (which was the only order founded in Hungary) the Gregorian tradition of Esztergom was kept and exercised faithfully, together with its liturgical characteristic features and variants in melody.
Unison singing still dominated at the end of the Middle Ages in Hungary, but this situation slowly changed from the 14th century. Then old music techniques became part of everyday practice (which was regarded as too unimportant to write down), well documented church polyphonies appeared only from the 15th century in Hungary.
In medieval music Gregorian songs dominated - in this respect the liturgical practice of schools, bishopric and monastic centres, parishes and royal chapels were unified.
According to experts Gregorian music could be heard in medieval churches for at least 3-4 hours per day.
The liveliness of the old musical style is proved but the fact that singing movements were increasing in certain genres (for example, the hallelujah-s, Kyrie-s, sequentia-s and readings).
The most important manuscripts containing musical notations were the decorated antiphonies dating back to the middle of the 15th century, which were kept in the library of Esztergom. These were the guardians of Hungarian liturgical-musical traditions.
Besides these the Graduale (1463) of Francis Futaki was also quite significant, which might have reached Istambul via Buda.
Another important Gregorian source from the second half of the century was the special antiphony made for the church of Várad at the request of bishop John Pruisz-Filipecz.
It is very interesting that its musical notation follows Czech examples, and its content mixes Hungarian melody variants and traditions with the traditions of the neighbouring regions.
The same can be said about the service books of the chapter of Szepes, and the graduales of Kassa, Kolozsvár, and Brasso from the beginning of the 16th century and the famous Ulaslo graduale.
Central traditions of Esztergom are preserved by a few codices of Buda from the turn of the 15-16th centuries, the most outstanding one was the two-volume Bakócz-Graduale.
The codices of the Paulian order, which contained musical notations which also preserved Hungarian traditions, such as the antiphony of Zagreb or the graduale of the parish of Nyitra.
Besides the Esztergom line, other traditions were represented by the southern codices (from the Kalocsa-Zagreb church district): for example, the antiphonies made at the request of the bishop of Zagreb, and Osvat Thuz (end of the 15th century).
Franciscan and Dominican codices from the turn of the 14-15 centuries, which contained musical notations, are special ones in the Hungarian musical tradition, because their music writing, the order of liturgy and melody variants all followed the traditions of their centralised order, and did not adopt the musical customs of the neighbouring territories.
The famous Matthias Graduale was also a special codex, isolated from the main stream of general musical education, since it also followed the melody variants and liturgical traditions of the Franciscan order (and in an indirect way those of the papal court).
Apart from recorded melodies, the cursive notes in books tell us a lot about the musical life of the medieval church, which also prove the high level of music writing and reading.
Later Archbishop of Esztergom, Ladislaus Szalkai's musical notes survived from the end of the 15th century, from the time when he was a student at Sárospatak.
In this booklet we can find a thorough practical and theoretical summary of Gregorian chants, including the aesthetic discussion of the topic.
Folk Songs in the Mother Tongue
The Hungarian Te Deum melody, which can be found in the 16th-century Peer codex, was probably quite popular in the Middle Ages (a variant of this is still sung in Transylvania), and as it was generally used it can be considered the first folk song in the mother tongue.
Another folk song - Christ Resurrected from his Great Suffering - was recorded in four languages in the so-called Fragment from the Sigismund Age (15th century), and probably it was sung at Easter in the four languages of the town in the Felvidék, where it was recorded.
In the Nádor codex of 1508 there are three folk songs: Ave Honourable Host, Ave Holy Mother of God, and Graceful Help for Sinners.
The other recordings (about 20-30) are just texts, which can be interpreted on the basis of later sources or folk practice.
The most significant of these were the Christmas Dies est lateittiae - The Day of Happiness - and the Franciscan Andrew Vásárhelyi's song from 1508: The Lady of Angels.
Other folk songs from this period, which were preserved by living folk tradition, are Shepherds, On the Day of Whitsun, and Oh, Bright Beautiful Dawn.
These songs can be divided into three categories according to their music and text: 1. paraliturgic (which are not closely related to ceremonies) movements with dogmatic messages, 2. the translations of Latin songs known throughout Europe (the so-called chants), 3. songs for local offices.
Epic Songs
It is known that the praise of predecessors was sung in Hungarian at king Matthias's table.
The famous St Ladislaus song was recorded quite late, at the beginning of the 16th century; this song praised the knight king, but in the framework of the thinking of king Matthias's time.
The song Good King Matthias was sung to the tune of this.
The recitative, dirge style of Hungarian folk music had an influence on later historic songs of the 16th century. These had several verses with a common epic style behind the 12-syllable parlando tunes.
The Medieval Layers of Folk Music
In this period, between the 14th and 16th centuries, a rich habit appeared, the forerunners of which were certain melodies.
What kind of songs could they be?
John Sylvester mentioned love songs in the 16th century, which would have been the preservers of rich Hungarian love lyrics - if they had survived (only one text of a chorus was recorded in a fragment from Sopron: Little flower, let me tell you I have to leave you and be in mourning because of you).
In folk melodies such choruses survived in wedding songs, matchmaking song and Midsummer Night's songs (Fly away, fly; Spring Breeze).
Apart from the customs of Midsummer Night, children's games (bridge, marching and pair changing kinds) might have preserved the traces of a once very rich and ceremonious medieval game.
Nativity plays and song became more dramatic in this period.
The custom of Ceremonious greetings (recordances) is also of medieval origin (Greetings at name days, Gergely marches).
The influence of schools was also quite significant. For example, we can find the traces of reciting poems, memorisation behind the tunes of the Wedding song of Nyitra.
The music of shepherd-dance melodies - which had similar roots to popular vagrant poetry - might have preserved the memories of medieval Hungarian dance music (just like nativity plays and the dance parts of Whitsun plays).
There are written records about dirges (mourning Robert Charles).
The tunes of contemporary dirges may have been the same as today's (it was a prosaic genre with improvised text, a textual-musical set of formulae, fixed cadence points), and the octave-size, so-called big form - in contrast with melodies of smaller ambitudes - probably became generally used in this period, too.
A great number of verse types might have been separated from improvised, prosaic recitatives at this time.
One of the most typical medieval styles was the so-called Révész melody circle, the melodic basis of which originated from a common root with Gregorian songs: they had the same structure as the 7th tone antiphonies.
At the end of the Middle Ages the volta-rhythm melodies and their developed versions formed a rich circle of variants.
The Musical Life of the Aristocracy
It can be generally said that in medieval thinking the earthly world reflected the heavenly hierarchy. Thus the hierarchy of man, for example, - oratores (praying people), bellatores (warriors) and laboratores (workers) - was also reflected in music, so in accordance with this clerical and profane music took separate paths.
Tinctoris (Queen Beatrix's musical instructor) wrote around 1475 that at a dinner party singers and pipers had to present a picture of heavenly joys.
The noise and harsh sounds of a feast was the reflection of earthly power and respect or they had a strategic importance.
For example, in the battle of Nándorfehérvár the blare of trumpets threatened the enemy - as it was written by a chronicler.
Sigismund's trumpeters and his choir were famous throughout Europe.
At the 1412 kings' meeting music was provided by 86 pipers and trumpeters (Sigismund's choir was later taken over and respected by king Albert).
At the synod of Constanz (1414-1418) a contemporary person's estimation of the number of present musicians was 1,700.
In 1485 king Matthias was escorted by musicians, when he met the Czech king.
Besides the royal court there were other centres of art and music: bishop John Vitéz's court in Vrad and Esztergom and bishop Michael Báthori's court at Vác.
Thomas Bakócz, the Archbishop of Esztergom and Janus Pannonius, bishop of Pécs were also dignitaries, who liked music very much.
From among the aristocratic centres the most important one was the royal court. By the 15th century it was famous for its singing and music throughout Europe.
The number of people in the royal choir in king Matthias's time was 40, and foreign guests praised it unanimously as Europe's best choir, which could compete with the papal choir in quality.
The choir had its own school, organist and wind musicians, and besides performing Gregorian music (with foreign guest singers and Hungarian soprano boy singers) there were polyphonic songs composed in the most sophisticated style on their repertory.
Matthias had a special correspondence, and he wanted to attract foreign musicians to Hungary.
Singer-composer Johannes Stockem worked in the country in the 1480s, as did Verjus (Jean Cornuel) and Erasmus Laicida.
Queen Beatrix had her own choir, and she herself played the harp.
The musical pomp of the wedding of the royal couple in Székesfehérvár was praised with enthusiastic accounts.
At a later date Pietro Bono was also a guest musician in Matthias's court, and the king made enormous efforts to invite the famous organist Paul Hofhaimer to his court.
After Matthias the Jagellos also sponsored music.
The famous organist, Master Grympeck, worked for them, and the Silesian composer Thomas Stolzer also worked at Buda for a couple of years.
According to 15th-century descriptions it was not only church ceremonies and public events which were accompanied by music, but dinners too - mostly by string and lute music, but some of the sources mentioned trumpets as well.
As it was described in a 1518 source, the streets of the castle district of Buda were echoing with trumpet and drum sounds, which shows that this habit was quite usual.
Musicians playing church and secular music were often the same people: experts, for example, and members of court chapels or choirs, including the organists.
Trumpeters played a special role, because they were the sounding symbols of secular power (they were at the front of the marching procession) and because of the singing function of their instruments (signals for troops in battles, signalling fires, tower music in cities).
At social gatherings the most important musical instrument was the lute, and the small portable organ (portative).
At home chapels and party pipes as well as string instruments were popular.
Medieval Polyphony
Although the practise of polyphonic music was not widespread in the 14-15th centuries, written sources prove that it was used and performed to a certain degree.
For example, the Paulians banned it in the 14th century (so it definitely existed), while in the Alexander codex polyphonic singing was considered as a heavenly joy from the beginning of the 16th century.
Polyphonic music could also be heard outside churches, as sources mention singers greeting Sigismund, Polish prince.
However, there are only a few sources with musical notations: the Fragment from Sigismund's age is from the first half of the 15th century, and the Fragment from Kassa is from the second half of the century.
Together they contain about 30 polyphonic movements.
When analysing these movements we can see that Hungarian common practice did not follow the most modern western European trends, but older teachings - sometimes more than a hundred year older, as in other regions on the European border.
This technique included parallel or counter organum, and the modern, more flexible, polyphonic chants.
The texts of these movements are usually connected to church festivals or ceremonies, or comment on those.
Polyphonic pieces with secular texts have not survived at all.
In contrast to this the musicians of the royal court followed the most modern polyphonic trends of the age - according to contemporaries.
This phenomenon, however, - just as the decorated Matthias Graduale - remained isolated, since it was just an import, and it did not have an influence on Hungarian culture.
Musical Life in the Cities
In the development of music in Hungary there was a backwardness from the age of knights, which was also noticable in the development of towns. As a result of this lag of several hundred years, there were only 25-30 towns in Hungary in the 15th century.
However, as far as the musical life of these towns was considered, they were very similar to western European ones.
The trumpet was the symbol of aristocratic, then bourgeois power (as a special privilege, Sigismund allowed the use of the trumpet in certain German cities).
Music was also part of the public/official life of cities (during initiations, advertisements, weddings, processions).
The several altar and mass foundations showed the devotion and desire of rich city people to preserve their memories. These foundations required the service of singers and musicians.
(For example, in the first half of the 15th century in Sopron there was a Corpus Christi association with 220-250 altarists.)
The procession became more and more colourful and pompous (dating from the 13th century): in 1494 in Pozsony it was accompanied with canon shots and trumpets).
Besides celebrations and processions music was part of family life in the cities.
Rich city people and their children learned to play musical instruments.
The most popular musical instrument of home music in the 15th century was the clavichord.
With the enrichment of people the use of the organ became quite popular, and young monastic orders (Franciscans, Paulians, Dominicans) showed a good example in this process.
Gypsies playing music were first mentioned at the beginning of the 16th century.
If Hungarian musical life is summarised before the battle of Mohács it can be seen that a Minorite monk, Pominóczky, recorded the verse lines Brother, brother, which way goes to Becskereke?, which was a musical idea to the tune of a prayer.
At Queen Maria's court we can find high-quality, sophisticated music with well-paid musicians (1525).
There were a lot of guest musicians at the royal court: among whom Heinrich Fink, Johannes Langus, Thomas Stolzer were the most outstanding, who visited and worked in Hungary.
The twenty-year old Valentine Bakfark came to Buda from Brasso to learn music from the luter of the Szapolyai court.
In contrast with all of these, at most of the places old polyphonic techniques were used - in the villages people sang together in one voice.
On the basis of the several musical notations in liturgical books it can be said that musical reading and writing was of a high quality and rather widespread.
Unfortunately the two kings of music playing: the old style, but generally widespread music practice and the imported top art of the royal court was not in balance - history did not give it the chance.
HISTORY OF DANCE
Early Renaissance Dances in Europe
With a little exaggeration we can say that the Renaissance was the most danceful period in European history.
Everybody was a keen dancer: noblemen, city people and peasants as well as kings, principals, dignitaries, popes and bishops.
Dance became one of the main symbols of irresistible Renaissance activity and the cult of the body.
Only very few things have survived from this special form of art among the memories of ancient cultures, so it could not become the feeder and fertiliser "ars nova", the obsession of Renaissance people towards ancient cultures.
Only peasant dances could play this role.
So dance - together with literature, music and other forms of art - also contributed to the development of the cult of different national cultures.
The bourgeoisie, the social class which sought to break up the feudal system, and whose aim was to form an autonomous culture representing their wealth and power, also wanted to create something very special in dance, too.
According to this idea, rich citizens tended to change the dance-music-play genres of anachronistic court culture and make peasant dances softer to fit their practical view of life.
Thus noble, bourgeois and peasant dances were distinct in Europe.
Their points of origin were the northern and middle part of Italy, France and Burgundy.
Dance Masters
Learned experts, or dance masters, as they were known, were needed to form and spread the new dance culture.
The first dance master, whose work was mentioned in written sources, was the Italian Domenico da Ferrara.
He was not a wandering joculator any more, but a great master of humanist education. He was a dance, fencing and riding instructor, the organiser of shows at celebrations, and he worked in the Este court of Ferrara.
His most famous students were Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro and Antonio Cornazano, the best known Italian dance masters of the second half of the 15th century.
Lorenzo Medici il Magnifico, a Florentine ruler (1449-1492), also joined him as a student, and was also a poet. He made his court a place, where famous scientists and artists met.
Master Dominico taught his students to respect "measures", the secrets of dancing in accordance with the neoplatonic and mystic world view of the age.
According to contemporary ideas, in the harmony of nature, the universe and a well-governed state, a mystic dance is reflected, which includes man, respected as a divine being.
The secrets of harmonic dance (misteri) are: keeping rhythm and tempo (misura), the balance of the movements of the body (maniera), keeping the right order of movements (memoria), using space properly (partire del terreno), the talents of the mind, softness, charm (aere), body skills, power of life and health (movimento corporeo).
The 15th century writings of Domenico and his students became the basic documents of universal European dance.
Court Dances
From books of the dance masters of the early Renaissance and contemporary documents of dance history we know exactly what and how people danced in Italy (Milan, Florence, Urbino and Ferrara), Burgundy and in European courts, which were closely or loosely connected to these areas.
There were two basic types of Italian and French dances in the 15th century: the bassadanza, basse dance (marching pair or trio dance) and the ballo, balletto (dance composition of several parts).
The meaning of the word basse is 'deep', which referred to the slowness and dignity of the dance.
This kind of movement was in connection with the fashion (clothes made of long and heavy textiles, shoes with long, peaked nose, heavy head decorations), and the sophisticated manners of the age.
The ballo, balletto was a dance composition for three, four, or six dancers, which consisted of four movements (misura) differing in rhythm, tempo and character.
These movements were the following in Italy: bassadanza, quadernaria, saltarello and piva.
From among these the bassadanza and saltarello were odd rhythm dances, and the quadernaria and piva were even rhythm dances. The saltarello was twice as fast as bassadanza, and the piva was twice as fast as the quadernalia.
The instrumental accompaniment of these movements was often the same as the melody, but the musicians could change those a little bit, according to the rhythm and the tempo. Here the dancer and the audience were not yet separated.
There were big differences between Italian and French dances in spite of the similarity of the names of the dances, which the dancers had to know.
Not Included in Early Renaissance Dance Books
In contemporary Italian and French dance collections there is no track of famous renaissance dances (such as the pavane, guilliard, passamezzo, courante, and volta).
They only appeared one or two decades later, in the second half of the 16th century, when they became very popular.
Dance collections did not contain well-known, simple circle dances (the branle and Rundtanz), which go back to old traditions, and remained popular at noble courts and dance parties of the bourgeoisie for one or two centuries.
There are no exact descriptions of the trionfo, a march in masks, which were organised at church and secular festivals, at parties given when ministers or principals visited the country, at weddings, at the "thirteen days" festivals between Christmas and the Twelfth night, and at patronal festivals or at carnivals.
Performances showing the victory of Love, Truth and Death were very popular: the Trionfo of the Three Blind Men from Christian and pagan mythology, and allegorical scenes from Roman history, and the moresca-s danced in masks in the English, Spanish, Flamand and even Hungarian style.
The festaiulo-s, who organised these dances, were poets, musicians, painters, dancers, actors and singers, too.
It was well-known that sometimes great artists of the period, like Botticelli, Leonardo and Dürer, also designed the costumes and sceneries of trionfo-s.
These secular, dancing-singing-dramatic performances were more capable of expressing the joy of life than the scenes of medieval mystery plays representing happiness in Paradise.
Terpsychore Looks for Accommodation in Hungary
In the early renaissance period Hungary had a quite busy dance life, similarly to western Europe, but sources only mention the existence of dances and their names.
Dance books, like Italian ones, describing the dances and music performed in Hungary unfortunately did not survive.
It is not known either whether the Italian and French collections in manuscripts were widespread in Hungary or not.
The collection known as the Brussels Manuscript from around 1460 may have been in the possession of Queen Maria (Louis II's wife) before it went to Margaret of Austria, but this is by no means certain.
Without reliable sources we must be content with references in contemporary chronicles, historical works, ministers' reports and diaries, and rare illustrations of dances.
Sources mention an "Italian dance" danced in Hungary (the wällischen Tanz and the höflische welschen Tanz), a string dance called the "Zeuner" (the hedge dance), a quick "German dance" (the Germanica pyrrichia), a dance in masks (the Mummerej), a dance with sticks in wooden shoes (the Tanz mit Stecken), a simple circle dance (the Rundtanz), a turning pair dance (Kehrab), war dances (the militarem pyrrhichiam and the Martiales choreas) and a sword dance.
There is an illustration of a pair dance on stove tiles, coming from King Matthias's workshop in Buda, and on a bronze chest buckle from the 15th century.
There are some other examples, when court entertainers playing the pipes are represented by swift movements, from which we can conclude that dances were also quick.
Several European sources mention that the Hungarian had special dances, which became fashionable in Europe during the late renaissance period.
Dances at King Matthias's Court
Most of the records on contemporary court dances can be traced to king Matthias's famous renaissance court.
The majority of these were mentioned by Antonio Bonfini, king Matthias's court historiographer, who was an eager dancer himself, a true renaissance man.
In his chronicle he described the dance-music scenes of court festivals and celebrations in detail.
From his writing we know that the people of Buda started to dance when Matthias was chosen to be king.
The king himself liked dancing, too.
In 1470, for example, during his visit to Emperor Friedrich, he was very good at the tournament and Hungarian dances.
Matthias liked entertainment even during states of war.
In the course of the siege of Boroszló, in 1474 he invited the dignitaries of the town and the Czech-Polish armies to a dance party.
The wedding of Matthias and Beatrix was also a great party.
According to the humanist writer Hans Seybolt, the minister of George a Bavarian prince, Beatrix danced with her brother the Prince of Naples in a dance called the Zäuner.
According to the report of the Pfalz's minister, Beatrix and Ulaslo (son of the Polish king Casimir III) danced a quick Germanica Pyrrichia (the German dance) in Olmütz as a pompous renaissance festival organised by king Matthias.
In Bonfini's opinion the Hungarians were badgering their king on a daily bases not to spend taxes on useless things, as he led a different life-style to his predecessors. He turned away from local strict morals, stopping old traditions and turning to Latin and Spanish entertainment and comfortable habits.
Beatrix was blamed for this, and it was said "...Queen Beatrix forced King Matthias to turn to Italian customs ...and brought ugly men, dancers, pipers, luters and fiddlers: because Queen Beatrix took pleasure in them".
Knowing about Beatrix's Italian connections (mainly from Ferrara), we can assume that the dances in Domenico de Ferrara's collection also reached Hungary.
Louis II's Commitment to Dance and the Moresca
After Matthias's death kings Ulaslo II and Louis II were not able to maintain the luxurious renaissance court.
King Louis II and Queen Maria's commitment to dance was too much for the poor treasury, and all of Europe knew about this.
From their childhood they had been used to pompous festivals and spectacular court performances, so they could not give them up later.
Marquis George of Brandenburg, uncle and tutor of king Louis II, wrote in 1519 in a letter to the chancellor of Brandenburg that he had had fun and he had danced at King Louis's court, which was otherwise very poor, and that the king himself danced happily in the company of noblemen.
"I came in a fancy dress (Mummerej) with 17 other colleagues, I was wearing a short coat and red pointed shoes, as those were wearing them earlier, then an old man turned up in wooden shoes and danced two special dances with a stick (the Tanz mit Stecken)".
A carnival dance with weapons and masks is also worthy of note, and was recorded by Prince Sigismund (Ulaslo Jagello's younger brother) in his steward book in Buda.
According to this mote, on 21 February, 1501, at the end of the carnival season students from Buda performed a sword dance for him at the place of his accommodation.
On the very same day masked jesters appeared with horses and also performed a sword dance for him, and they were rewarded.
These sword dances and woodcuts made for Emperor Maximilian at this time showing masked Hungarian dancers with weapons, or the Hungarian figure among the moresca dancers at the town hall of Munich all refer to the fact that the "moresca" was a very popular dance in Europe and Hungary as well.
The Hungarian kings love of pomp and dances at the beginning of the 16th century would not have been uncommon, and Louis II would not have picked up the nickname "the rascal dancing king", if he had been rich enough, Turkish threat had not been approaching.
Dance in Poetry
Among the products of the slowly developing Hungarian literature and poetry there are lines about dance, too.
The first one dates back to 1505 from Körmöcbánya; it was a dance term, which is very important from the point of view of linguistics, literature and dance.
The second record is the satiric lines of Francis Apáti's Cantilena of 1526 about girls who pretend to be meek.
In the seventh part of the Book of Parables, known as the Alexander codex, which was made by the Dominican nuns of the Island of Rabbits (Margaret Island) in 1521, there were some beautiful lines about the dance of saints in Heaven.
War Dances, Soldiers' Dances, the First Record of Dance of Liveried Attendants
The fashion of war dances continued during the 15-16th centuries and it developed in the direct battles with the Turks.
Three examples will be mentioned, all of which are special and unique in Central and Western Europe: The first one took place at the siege of Nándorfehérvár in 1456.
According to Giovanni da Tagliacozzo who was a Franciscan monk and John Kapisztrán's escort, the defenders of the castle were to have a merry time by Kapisztrán's order: "some of them were singing with the horns, others were screaming, some of them were dancing or crying and jumping with their arms in the air ... with this they wanted to break the Turks' confidence and breviary, and thus attempted to threaten them...".
The other example is the case which took place at the victory party after the battle of Kenyérmezõ in 1479. Antonio Bonfini reported it on the basis of stories told by eye-witnesses: "At dinner war songs were sung (militari cantu), in which they praised the leaders and commanders".
Then, excited by the wine they drank, they started to dance a war dance (the militarem pyrrhychiam).
They danced with their weapons (the Martiales choreas), and there was a big noise.
At the peak of the party every soldier made the others laugh, they used strange and funny movements and gestures.
Kinizsi was also invited to dance, he stood in the middle of the circle, picked up a Turkish dead body with his teeth without touching it with his hands.
Then he started to jump with the body around.
The people were just staring at him, shocked at this Herculean dance (choream se et Herculeo).
They had a good time after that, and did not even go to sleep that night.
The third example is about George Dózsa's execution.
Several contemporary sources recorded this event, which was especially cruel.
According to Antal Verancsics's report: "[He]ordered that George the Székely's clothes be taken off to the belt, and had him tied to the chair and the tree.
He also had his warriors dance a recruitment dance (alias dance of liveried attendants), during which the soldiers bit George's body upon each round".
Peasant Dances - Common "Hungarian" Characteristic Features
By recording feudal customary law - in Hungary it meant when Werbõczy compiled his Triple book in 1514 - peasants appeared as a different political group, and it slowly led to the separation of noble culture from peasant culture.
Peasants became the spreaders of traditional dance culture, while noblemen (and the western European bourgeoisie) started to follow new European dance fashions.
The layer between these two cultures, which showed common characteristic features, became thinner and thinner.
Galeotto Marzio, king Matthias's Italian librarian, was surprised at the fact that both the aristocrats and simple people still understood the language of songs, in which the deeds of Hungarian heroes were sung in Hungarian at the table of the king, accompanied by the lute.
In his own country, in Italy, it was not possible any more, as the language and culture of different social groups were totally separated.
Bonfini also mentioned that at the court there was no dinner without military songs - cantus militaris -, when their heroes were praised by improvised songs.
If we compare this with the war dances and songs mentioned at the description of the battle of Kenyérmezõ, we can find an old, surviving line of contemporary culture, which was a special genre of improvised folk poetry performed with music and pantomime.
This 'genre' also included circle dances accompanied with singing and music, jumping-stamping-pattering dances of undifferentiated genres in solo, pairs or groups, and dances with accessory tools or without them.
These must have been the special Hungarian dances of the early renaissance period, according to which the dances of dignitaries, soldiers or simple pilgrims were defined as Hungarian.
This did not mean that there were no similar dances at other places, but these dances were dying out in Central Europe, and they were replaced by free individual pair dances, representing love lyrics.
CHURCH HISTORY
RELIGION, CHURCH
Church and Politics
Strengthening the Right of Advowee
In the decades after king Sigismund's death Hungary managed to convince the Holy See, that popes should accept the fact that bishopric and archbishopric offices be controlled by the king (or governor and the royal council), because he has the right to present and appoint nominees.
Rome had to accept and support the suitable nominees.
However, if the Holy See refused to support the nominee, the candidate of the king could lead his local parish and enjoy its incomes as an elected bishop (electus), moreover, he could take part in the meeting of the royal council.
The pope could exercise his right to appoint office bearers in the event of prelates dying in Rome.
King Matthias, however, achieved his objectives even then: after Archbishop John Aragon's death in Rome, in 1486 he appointed his relative, the 7-year old Hippolit Estei to be the head of the Hungarian church through the connections of his wife.
Sometimes the king did not exercise his right to appoint nominees but let one of his followers do so: Michael Ország Guti was allowed to appoint someone to be the bishop of Nyitra, although the king soon withdrew this privilege.
As a result of his conquests, Matthias used his advowee's right outside Hungary, which explains how Orban Nagylúcsei got to the lead of the bishopric of Vienna.
Systematic church policy did not change during the Jagellos, either.
When Pope Alexander VI re-affirmed the right of the pope to appoint nominees for the benefices of the papal court, the 1495 parliament put forward a resolution: those who did not receive their estates from the king himself should be drowned in water.
Stephen Werbõczy's Triple Book, which had a great influence on the thinking of the centuries to follow, recorded the king's right of advowee in four paragraphs.
Rome's Support Against the Turks
The compliance of popes concerning the right of advowee was closely related to the struggle against the 'faithless' Turks.
Rome knew that stopping further conquests of the Osmans in a surface war was impossible without the participation of Hungary.
Hungarian leaders also knew that the country could not push back the approaching Osman troops without the help (money, organisation and connections) of the papacy.
The Holy See entrusted the important figures of papal diplomacy, for example, Cardinals Giuliano Cesarini and Juan de Carvajal as legates, with the organisation of the crusades (1444, 1456).
Popes Pius II, Paul II and Sixtus IV sent significant amounts of money to Hungary for this purpose during Matthias's reign.
Between 1459 and 1476 250,000 golden forints were sent, but since the king had no active Turkish policy these benefits were withdrawn, but then resumed in the 1500s.
In the Jagello age Hungary's relationship with the Vatican was maintained by permanent representatives from both sides, in Buda and Rome.
The Vatican - as it was against the Turks - treated Hungary as her most important diplomatic partner, and therefore had important representatives in Buda: the most talented diplomats of Rome tried to organize the Turkish war (although they sometimes hindered opportunities to make peace).
In 1513 Thomas Bakócz, who had earlier been a candidate for papal election, became the legate to organize the crusade, but it turned into a peasants' revolt.
Papal ministers, the best-known of whom was Antonio Burgio, were allowed to take part in the meetings of the royal council, so they could also intervene in domestic matters.
With the approval of the papal minister, a great quantity of church relics - made of precious metals - was collected before the battle of Mohács, and used for the benefit of the country.
Prelates in Politics
Prelates, as the ecclesiastical part of the barons of the country, were official members of the royal council and parliament.
Prelates were the two archbishops and the 14 bishops (including the church leaders of the Szerém region, Bosnia, Croatia, Modrus and Tinn), the chapter of Székesfehérvár and the prior of Vrána, the leader of the Johannite order in Hungary.
While during the reign of Matthias the ruler could control the power of prelates, in the age of the Jagellos the prelates became the political leaders of the country - as office bearers in the chancellery. Their power in politics was linked directly to their wealth.
The majority (two thirds) of their income came from the tithe, which was collected by their own network of tithe collectors or alternatively reached them as tithe rent.
As they had a greater income than secular landlords, they had to provide a defined number of soldiers in the event of war.
According to the 1498 law, paragraph 20, church dignitaries had to provide 7,000 mounted soldiers, 4,100 of these by the bishops.
Church dignitaries gave much more money for the defence of the country than other social groups.
In the decades before the battle of Mohács the defence of the country was based on church banderies besides royal armies of fortresses along the border.
Several talented prelates, such as Peter Beriszló or Paul Tomori, surpassed their secular colleagues as military leaders.
Several senior church positions were united, as they wanted to centralise the defence of the country.
This was a common phenomenon in 15th-century Europe, but in most of the cases it served the material interests of prelates, enabling them to support also cultural activities.
From their incomes prelates had to pay tithe for the papal court, and perform other duties and services for the papal bull at appointments (servitium) and the annata.
From among church people only prelates took a collective part in domestic politics.
However, the whole Hungarian church did not turn into a separate political body during the development of the estate system.
This was in part due to the fact that in Hungary the ratio of church estates was insignificant compared to other European countries (being about 15 %).
Apart from some huge estates belonging to prelates (the archbishopric of Esztergom, the bishopric of Eger, Várad, and Pécs, the abbey of Pannonhalma - which were equivalent to medium-sized estates of secular landowners, barons) the majority of church institutions were medium-sized or small holdings.
The number of fortresses owned by the church was also insignificant (about 12 %), and these did not become centres of mansions.
Church estates - in principle the estates of patron saints - were generally scattered on large territories, in the country, and in contrast with secular estates, this fact made their defence more difficult, and increased their maintenance costs.
Canons in the Service of Politics
In the Middle Ages there was no group of clerks centrally paid for government, juristic or diplomatic...etc. duties.
In the early period (11-12th centuries) the king entrusted learned church persons, that is clerks (especially canons of chapters) with working for the government.
From the 13-14th centuries, however, the employees of the royal court (royal secretaries, judging masters, clerks of the chancellery and office holders of the treasury) were paid or rewarded by receiving a church estate.
Because of the small numbers of bishopric chairs, the honours of canons at chapters were quite suitable for this purpose, as nominees for these honours were appointed by the king from the 14th century, thanks to his advowee's right.
The financial support of students studying at foreign universities was also provided by canon estates in the lack of a scholarship system.
Church Serving Society
The Upper and Middle Layer
Canons in secular offices, who studied or taught abroad, rarely stayed at the chapter, where their regular duties were performed by their substitutes.
By the 15th century chapters became institutions which financially supported the intellectual activity of the clerks in the country.
Many of these clerk-intellectuals, who joined the church because they were forced to, or were required to do so by society and who held offices as canons or bishops, had a basically secular world view. They did not really want their offices, they accepted them reluctantly, as bishopric nominees (for example, George Szatmári and Ladislaus Szalkai). They tried to do their best in their prelate duties too.
The first primate of the age of Matthias was Cardinal Denis Szécsi, who tried to re-introduce strict principles in church with synods at church districts and his official visits.
Priests and Believers in Villages
Church persons lower down in the hierarchy, such as priests of smaller parishes and chaplains, often copied the life style of their superiors.
There are data in source material even on breaking celibacy. They were in direct contact with the people: they celebrated mass, preached, gave the sacraments, controlled and checked the keeping of Sundays and holidays - there were about 100 such days.
Their work and their life styles were supervised by their direct superiors, that is deans, who were chosen from among them (from bigger parishes) and who lived in the same place at the residence of their church districts.
They sent their report to the chief deans to the centre of the church district where the deans lived as members of the chapter. They sometimes paid a visit to the parishes.
In 15th-century Hungary there were hardly any settlements which did not have a church.
These churches made of stone or sometimes wood served as a shelter for the village people in times of emergency. In Transylvania the so-called fortress churches were built for this very purpose.
Newer village churches were founded as the subsidiary (filia) of the nearest parish church.
There were serious debates between the mother church and its subsidiaries about the income of the parish derived from the believers.
At Buda the priest of the church of the Virgin Mary was against the separation of its subsidiaries as independent parishes.
Employing village priests was the right and duty of the advowees, but common people could also intervene in the election of the parish priest in the 15th century, not only in cities and market towns, but also in small villages.
The management of the church supported the rights of the believers, the guardians of the churches chosen from among them dealt with the church estate, and sometimes they could check the parish priest himself.
Local priests usually came from serf families, but by the end of the Middle Ages their education was quite good.
Most of them had already had all the basic liturgical books.
Priests were not only pastors of their villages but also the spiritual leader and advisor of the people, the preservers of local traditions.
It is not by chance that they took part in the 1514 peasant war in great numbers.
In contemporary texts there are references to lustful priest, who frequented drinking houses, or to despotic priests.
Priests and the Believers in Cities
By the end of the Middle Ages religion was still very popular, but it changed, becoming more intimate and personal.
City life also influenced religion, and new forms of religious life were born, such as the different religious associations with secular members (confraternitas).
Most of them were founded under the name Body of Christ, and they were distinguished associations of patricians.
Guilds also functioned as religious communities, too, which set up a (winged) altar in their churches from their money, and organised their feasts together, at which they celebrated with their family members.
The bourgeoisie gradually took control over taking care of the poor and sick, which had earlier been the privilege of the church.
Institutions controlled by the town, and maintained by the church were hospitals and old people's homes.
The priests of 15th-century privileged churches considered their offices merely a source of income, and in contrast with their colleagues in villages, having the whole tithe guaranteed a comfortable life for them.
They hardly ever appeared at their parish, their tasks were performed by their substitutes, the chaplains.
The chaplains were in the same position as village parish priests. The believers gave a lot of money and contributions to the church in the hope that they could encourage the salvation of the dead and shorten the time spent in the purgatory.
An altar or a chapel played an important role in supporting the clerical-intellectual layer through land and money contributions.
Both priests and the believers frequently misused the graces of the mass.
The Church in Everyday Life
Because of the high rate of infant mortality people were encouraged to take new-born babies to church very soon (within eight days) to be baptised by emersing the child under water three times, in order to make them members of the church.
Confirmation - a sacrament that enriches the soul with the presence of the Holy Ghost, so that he/she could live according to his/her faith - also took place at a young age, at a similar time to the first confession.
By that time children had to know the necessary prayers, the Lord's Prayer (Pater Noster), the Ave Maria and the Credo (Symbolum).
The believers usually made a confession and received the sacrament once a year.
The sacrament of marriage could be received from the age of 14 for boys, and from the age of 12 for girls, according to canon law.
In cases of emergency and illness a priest was called to render to the child the extreme unction.
They could also declare their last will at this point, which was written down by the local priest, who also checked whether it was kept.
The dead were buried in the cemetery around the church.
Only those advowees and dignitaries could be buried in the church itself who had made a donation towards the building of it.
Pagans, excommunicated people and those who had committed suicide or a deadly sin were not buried according to church ceremonies.
Funerals and other important events, and feasts were performed according to special colourful ceremonies, and liturgical activities which could vary in different church districts.
Some of these ceremonies were quite spectacular, such as the procession.
At Latin ceremonies the faithful usually took part as an audience, but in the 15th century there were vernacular variants of liturgical hymns, such as Mary songs.
The faithful asked for the saints' help if they were in trouble in everyday life.
Church and Education
At the end of the Middle Ages the training of village priests took place at the parishes, in accordance with old traditions.
Candidates had to take an exam in front of a bishopric committee on their knowledge necessary for performing liturgy and parish administration.
They had to know basic texts by heart, and they also had to be able to sing and read.
Higher knowledge was available only in chapter schools, some of which became the centre of Hungarian humanism in the 15th century (Pécs, Várad).
The third Hungarian university was also founded in a chapter residence. It was founded in Pozsony (Academia Istropolitana, 1467) with the help of King Matthias and John Vitéz.
Due to the lack of royal and archbishopric support it was closed by the 1490s.
Almost half of Hungarian canons and bishops studied at foreign universities.
Efforts for Reforms at Monastic Orders
The originally observant monastic orders - the Benedictines, Cistercians and Premontreans - dealt mainly with liturgical tasks, and were declining by the end of the Middle Ages.
They did not pay enough attention to the education of their members.
The lucky ones were the monasteries which had special functions besides their original tasks, such as Báta, which was a place of pilgrimage, and Kapornak and Garamszentbenedek, which were outstanding credible places.
There was a reform movement against collision at the beginning of the 16th century under the leadership of Matthew Tolnai, the chief abbot of Pannonhalma. The aim of the movement was to unite originally independent monasteries.
The union of monasteries under the authority of royal advowees - Pannonhalma, Pécsvárad, Szekszárd, Báta, Somogyvár, Zalavár, Garamszentbenedek and Bakonybél - took place in 1512, but it was not very successful.
The reform of the Cistercian order was specially encouraged by king Matthias, while the reorganisation of the Premontreans was led by the prepost of Ság, Francis Fegyverneki, connected to the reform movements of the French mother monastery, and was also supported by Thomas Bakócz.
Besides being credible places (the biggest organisation issuing charters was at Lelesz in the late Middle Ages) the Premontreans were pastors, as it was their task to be regular canons.
They did this against the will of the secular priests, bishops and deans several times, because monks were not allowed to work as pastors.
They became very popular because of their commitment.
In the 15th century nine Benedictine and ten Premontrean monasteries functioned as credible places, while there were no Cistercian credible places. They also refused to bury the dead in their churches.
Flourishing Hermit and Popular Begging Orders
There was no need to reform the four Carthausian monasteries, as they followed their original ideas consequently, and their foreign relations - especially Austrian and German - also helped them in this.
They were very good at copying and writing codices (first of all Lövöld).
The Paulians not only managed to keep their popularity, but were also able to found more monasteries, and the number of their cloisters grew to 90 by 1450.
Founders were kings, prelates, aristocrats and dignitaries.
Instead of building monasteries the Dominicans kept their influence in cities by careful pastoring, and scientific work was also common for their members.
Their college in Buda (studium generale) was the most permanent Hungarian university in the Middle Ages, the last date on it was 1530.
The task of the Dominicans in the church was to find heretics, that is inquisition.
After pushing back Hussitism in the middle of the 15th century, they did not have too much work.
In 1483 the Pope appointed one of the lecturers of the Dominican college of Buda (Michael Kassai) to be inquisitor, this honour had not been given to anyone for a very long time.
There is little evidence about the activities of late medieval inquisitors.
In the years before the battle of Mohács they had to fight against the Lutheran reformation, mainly in Buda and in some German cities. The foreign circles of Queen Maria were in favour of this new discipline.
Laws were enacted at parliaments against the followers of the new belief (1523:53 and 1525:4). Their punishment was execution and confiscation of their animals, then death by burning.
In fact, however, there were only one or two executions.
From among the begging orders the biggest change took place with the Franciscans.
The Hungarian Franciscan order founded only 8 new monasteries after 1350, the last one in 1425.
With this a reform movement started within the order in the 14th century, which placed an emphasis on keeping St Francis's strict regulations (this is why they were called Observants). This movement was against the old one called the Conventual, or marian movement, which focused on common wealth and settlement in convents.
The other branch of the Franciscan order (which was later called the salvatorian branch) spread from the Bosnian district to Hungary at the end of the 14th century.
An independent Hungarian province was set up in 1448, after they had taken over control in several monasteries from the conventuals.
In principle the unity of the Franciscan order was preserved until the end of the Middle Ages, but in fact the observants could be considered as an independent monastic order.
Total separation was officially declared in 1517.
The observants were supported by rulers and dignitaries, and the number of their monasteries increased significantly: around 1440 they had 25 convents, in 1475 they had 49 monasteries in ten districts (custodia), around 1500 there were 67, and before the battle of Mohács 70 convents.
In these there lived 1500-1700 monks.
The reason for their popularity was that they were pastors in smaller towns and villages.
Minutes recording John Kapisztrán's canonisation prove that folk religion was born as a result of their work.
There was a great need for their activities on the southern border, where Osman missions were converting people.
Their criticism of society, which lasted for several decades, - especially through the work of Pelbárt Temesvári and Osvát Laskai - played an important role in the preparation and outbreak of the Dózsa peasants' war.
Nuns
Mainly the Dominicans and Franciscans controlled the religious life of the communities of nuns, which belonged to their monastic order: tertiary nunneries and begina houses.
There were not many nunneries in Hungary, but the nuns living there came from the most respected dignitary families.
The most famous Dominican nunnery was the one on the Island of Rabbits (Margaret Island), which was as popular at the end of the Middle Ages as in St Margaret's time in the 13th century.
The Franciscan Clarissans had only 5 or 6 nunneries in Hungary, and the best-known was the one was founded by Queen Elisabeth (Louis the Great's mother) in Óbuda.
Their job made them the most popular governesses in female aristocratic society - there were nuns who later returned to secular life - and they also were the creators of codex literature in Hungarian.
Outside the Catholic Church
The Jews
Jews living in Hungarian towns were considered royal chamber servants, so they were under direct royal protection.
Since the Anjou times their leader was the "judge of the Jews", appointed from among secular dignitaries, with the task of keeping a record of their possessions, and with the responsibility to collect tax from them.
With king Matthias's reforms in the treasury John Ernuszt founded a so-called national Jewish organisation, which replaced the old office and was led by a Jewish person who had the power to protect the rights of the Jews.
At the end of the Middle Ages sources mention Jews in 38 settlements, but the situation for these 15,000-20,000 people had deteriorated by the end of the Middle Ages.
The church did not attack them, but the weakening royal power was not able to protect them from the hostility of society - a reaction to their wealth and economic status.
In 1525, for example, the house of Emeric Szerencsés, a Jewish man, was attacked in Buda.
Greek Catholics
The fate of Greek Catholic ethnic groups (Serbians, Rumanians, Ruthenians), who were growing in numbers in the southern and eastern parts of Hungary because of the Turkish push-forward, was not influenced by the union of the Western and Eastern churches in 1439 in Florence after long negotiations.
Although they had a Greek-traditioned, but Catholic bishop, lack of data made it difficult to decide how seriously they took the disciplines of the union.
The residence of the bishop was in the Greek Catholic monastery of Körtvélyes, founded by the predecessors of the Drágfi family in 1391, or in the monastery of Munkács, which had the rights of Greek Catholic bishops from 1491.
The leaders of these monasteries (iugumens) gained the right to consecrate Greek Catholic priests in Hungary from the patriarch of Constantinople.
George Brankovics, Serbian despot and his family remained Greek Catholic, so there were Greek Catholic bishops in and around their estates, which was consecrated as the bishopric of Nándorfehérvár.
FOLK BELIEFS
Patronal Festivals, Pilgrimages
Pilgrimages played a very important role in the religious life of the Middle Ages.
Those of the believers who visited the church or place of pilgrimage and performed the necessary activities - that is made a confession, chanted certain prayers - gained indulgence for a certain number of days, shortening the time to be spent in the purgatory.
There was a hierarchy among places of pilgrimage: the most significant places were visited by thousands of pilgrims year by year, sometimes coming from several hundred or even thousands of kilometres away, while the majority of churches possessing a permission attracted people from only a very small distance away (some villages).
The most important of the 15-16th-century places of pilgrimage in Hungary was St Ladislaus's tomb in Várad.
The tomb of the knight king, who was canonised in 1192, was visited by people from everywhere, even Hungarian kings felt it was their duty to make a pilgrimage to Várad.
There were four other significant tombs in medieval Hungary: St Stephen's in Székesfehérvár, St Margaret (Béla IV's daughter)'s on the Island of Rabbits (Margaret Island) (although Margaret died in 1270, she was canonised only in 1943), Hermit St Paul's in the Paulian monastery of Budaszentlõrinc with his relics taken from Venice in 1381, and John Kapisztrán's in Újlak, who died in 1456.
The network of Hungarian places of pilgrimage was made richer by the holy blood places of pilgrimage, which appeared from the second half of the 14th century: the first ones were Esztergom and Kassa.
The Benedictine monastery of Garamszentbenedek was another very popular place, which also had the holy blood relic, just like the church of Ludberg in Slavonia, but the most famous holy blood relic was kept in Báta, in the Benedictine monastery.
Hungarian places of pilgrimage were visited primarily by peasants and the lower layers of bourgeoisie.
Clerics were represented by priests from the lower part of the church hierarchy, and the nobility by simple, common noblemen, but no aristocrats or prelates were seen at these places.
Hungarian pilgrims visited not only Hungarian places, but foreign ones too, albeit only the most significant ones.
Their most usual destinations were Rome, Aachen and Jerusalem, but they also reached the distant Santiago de Compostella, the French Rocamadour, the Italian Bari and Loreto and St Patrick's purgatory in Ireland.
Pilgrims heading for Aachen visited other important places on their way: Cologne, Trier, Düren and Regensburg.
The nearby church of Mariazell became a popular place of pilgrimage for Hungarian pilgrims from the end of the 14th century, after Louis the Great's donation.
Pilgrims from Hungary went abroad mainly for graceful purposes.
Because of the great distances the poor and the sick could not go on foreign pilgrimages - they rather visited Hungarian places of pilgrimage.
Hungarian pilgrims were the bourgeoisie of towns and wealthier noblemen.
The bourgeoisie preferred Aachen, but many of them went to Rome, where people from all kinds of social groups could go: Aachen was visited when the big pilgrimage took place every seven years, while Rome was visited in jubilee holy years.
Due to difficulties and high costs only aristocrats reached the Holy Land.
As far as church people were concerned there was no big difference between priests of the lower part of the hierarchy and prelates: they could be found at all kinds of places of pilgrimage.
Two detailed descriptions of a journey have survived from the beginning of the 16th century, written by church authors. One of them was written between 1514 and 1517 by a Franciscan monk, Gabriel Pécsváradi, who stayed in the Holy Land, and in the other one we can read about the Transylvanian canon, John Lászai's journey in a diary written by his friend and travelling companion, Felix Faber, who was a Dominican monk.
Before leaving, the pilgrim had to collect the money for his journey. If he went to the Holy Land he had to ask for papal permission for the journey, and he also had to take care of his possessions and family at home (for example, he could postpone his trials).
The costs of an average pilgrimage to Rome or Aachen were 30-40 golden forints, the costs of a journey to the Holy Land were four or five times more.
The pilgrimage of a baron cost much more, because he took his servants and armed soldiers with him: it was an outstanding event in Italy when the Bosnian king, Michael Újlaki went to Rome in 1475, and in 1502 prince John made a pilgrimage to Loreto at the head of an army of 100 people.
Folk Religion
Christianity and ideas outside Christian beliefs - about supernatural beings and power - were not contradictory.
For example, even the most educated persons believed in beating someone with the naked eye, in cursing or in magic.
These ideas contradicted official church principles only when they were considered profanation, or were used together with heretic disciplines, or if they caused harm to others.
In such cases magicians were brought to court, the case examined according to the usual procedure, and the sentence declared.
There are no data on major, hysterical persecution of magicians in medieval Hungary.
Folk healing and magic were closely related to each other.
Women who knew herbs - they were called enchanters or watchers - recited rhymes which had the power to heal the patient.
The word watcher referred to a connection with the other world.
Watchers were able to find lost treasures or animals, and could talk to the souls of the dead.
They used human hair or secretion or animal organs for their magic.
The consecrated objects of the church were very important, e.g.: altars or Jesus' or St John's scrapped eye from a portrait.
However magic with these objects was very risky, as it was punished with death by burning if discovered.
LAND AND PEOPLE
GEOGRAPHY
From the 13th century the weather was colder and wetter in Eurasia then in the previous centuries.
In the second half of the 15th century there was a short warmer, transitional period, followed by cold and wet weather for two centuries, which started at the turn of the century. This was called the 'mini ice-age'.
There was much more water in the rivers than today, and water levels were high everywhere for a long time.
This climate was favourable for the development of woods, but due to the increased demand for firewood trees were regularly cut down.
Because of long winters domesticated plants needed less time to produce, but cereals were threatened by rotting.
ETHNIC MINORITIES
The Hungarian Kingdom was a multinational country in the late Middle Ages, as well as throughout the course of its history.
In this age significant influxes of ethnic minorities came only at the end of the period, when Serbian settlers entered the country, otherwise the process was very slow.
There are no exact data about the proportion of ethnic minorities, nor are there are any exact data on the whole population of the country.
Belonging to a national minority group often meant a political and juristic affiliation, too.
Settlement of the Northern-East Carpathians, which had started earlier, continued, although at a slower pace. The Ruthenians were the first to go there.
In Transylvania and territories close to the ban district of Szörény the settling of Rumanians with vlach right went on.
There was no possibility for transhuming shepherding, but most of them were still engaged in shepherding, and often changed their habitations.
The Rumanian kenéz-s became noblemen in Hunyad, Fogaras, Hátszeg and Máramaros, and their rights were not different from the privileges of Hungarian common noblemen.
The traditional national and threefold (primors, horsechiefs and common székelys) society of the Székelys was slowly disintegrating.
The first Gypsies came from the Balkans to Transylvania during the reign of Sigismund, and their settlement slowly continued.
The leading group of the Transylvanian Saxons, the gerébs, merged with the nobility and became Hungarian.
At this time the upper social group of the Saxons consisted of citizens of towns, and the peasants lived more freely than Hungarian villeins.
In southern counties, such as Bács and Szerém, the majority of the inhabitants were Hungarian, but the Serbs moved into this region continuously from the time of Sigismund.
In 1440 another significant process started: the keve-s of county Keve escaped to Ráckeve, thus the first, northern Serbian settlement appeared on the banks of the Danube.
The Croatian population of the southern and Slavonian counties was decimated by the Turkish attacks.
There was no significant change in the population of the Slovenes of the Mura region and the Slovenians of the Felvidék.
Towns, which used to have a German population, - except for the ones along the western border and the ones inhabited by the Transylvanian Saxons - became Hungarian, or at certain places of the Felvidék became Slovak.
The national separation of the kuns disappeared, and they became an ethnic group with special privileges.
GOVERNMENT
King and Governor
On top of the social hierarchy there was the king, who was not a puppet ruler, but was expected to decide on every matter in the state.
The ruler controlled foreign policy, he decided in matters of war and peace, and he personally went to fight, even in the late Middle Ages.
Administration of justice and granting a pardon was also his duty.
Only the king could give away an estate.
His power was regulated primarily by customary law, although some of the acts referred to the king, none of them listed all the legal rights of the king.
In some extraordinary cases the country was controlled by the governor. His rights were limited by law, and his power was not as great as the king's.
The biggest difference in power was that the governor could not give away an estate bigger than 32 villein segments of lands.
In the course of Hungarian history the first governor was John Hunyadi, elected in 1446. He held his office from 1446 to 1452.
Michael Szilágyi was also a governor assisting the young king Matthias for half a year in 1458.
The Royal Council
The most important governing organ was the royal council, and the ruler asked for its advice in all the matters.
It had regular meetings. Originally only bishops and barons could take part in the meetings, but not all of them on each occasion.
During the reign of Matthias there were 5 bishops and 9 barons in it on average.
In special cases it exercised the power of the king, for example, in 1445, after Matthias's death.
It had a signet made with the writing 'The Signet of the Unity of Hungary'.
From 1498 common nobleman assessors - elected by the parliament - could also take part in the meetings.
They did not really represent the interests of their estate in practise, as they were the dependants of the noblemen in the council, so they had to vote according to the will of their lords.
The Parliament
By this period parliaments had real significance.
The king or the governor summoned the meetings, and at the election of a king it was the palatine's duty.
The frequency of the meetings was regulated in the Jagello age, but it was not important to hold a meeting annually even then.
Their most important right was that they could impose the war tax, but taxes were collected without the agreement of the parliament even at the end of the Middle Ages.
The place of the meetings was the Rákos mezõ [Rákos field] near Pest.
At the meetings the royal council discussed the problems separately from the representatives of common noblemen and towns. At such occasions the members of the royal council gathered in bigger numbers, and the later House of Lords was formed from the royal council.
At the meetings of the parliament four estates were represented: prelates, barons, common noblemen and the estates of towns.
They had the right to take part at meetings until 1848.
Common noblemen appeared sometimes as elected representatives of a county, and sometimes they all turned up personally.
The estates of cities were the representatives of civitates tavernicales and personales and mining towns of lower Hungary.
They first appeared at the meetings of the parliament in 1444, but their political role was quite insignificant: partly because they were not interested in domestic politics, and partly because they were not invited to all the meetings.
The inhabitants of Slavonia and Transylvania had separate representatives.
The Palatine and the Administration of Justice
The most important office holder was the palatine, and his significance grew in the age of estates.
It was the only honour which was elected by the parliament from 1439, and not appointed by the king.
He was the mediator between the ruler and the estates if there was a debate.
In 1486 his rights were listed in the so-called palatine clauses.
Actions for possession and serious criminal proceedings were tried only at the royal court.
At first there were three, then four courts of justice: the court of the palatine's presence, the court of the king's presence, the courts of the king's special and personal presence. The last two were later merged and led by the personnel clerk.
Chancellery and Treasury
The chancellery was reformed in 1464: the offices of the secret and chief chancellor were merged with the two chancelleries.
Besides writing charters the chancellery also dealt with the preparations of government decisions.
Royal estates were separated from the treasury. Matters of the royal estates were settled by the court judge of Buda from 1458 until 1541.
As part of monetary reforms the treasury became a united organisation during the reign of Matthias: chambers, which had been separate chambers, came under the strict authority of the treasurer.
Administration in the Country and Credible Places
Slavonia was governed by the ban, and the Slavonian estates could intervene into the election of the deputy of the ban.
In Transylvania, however, there was no independent development of the estates: the power of Hungarian voivodes, appointed by the king, remained unchanged, and they also acquired the office of the independent Székely ispán [bailiff].
The autonomy of the Transylvanian Saxons increased significantly, in 1486 the king confirmed the 1224 Adreanum, which contained the rights of the Saxons living in the Szeben "province".
From 1486 other Saxon territories in Transylvania lived according to these privileges: and "Saxon unity" was born.
Local administration was settled by the counties in most parts of the country.
Minor cases were judged, different matters were settled by order of higher judges, for example people were summoned, investigations were made, taxes were collected, armies were formed. The nobility intervened in the work of the parliament through them and they declared the new laws.
Almost all matters were settled at the court of justice of the county, which was called sedria.
The county also started to function as a local government, although this process was very slow.
From 1485 ispáns [bailiff] had to elect their deputy ispáns from among the wealthy noblemen of the county.
In some parts of the Szászföld [Saxonland], Székelyföld [Székelyland], Kunság and Szepesség there were no counties, but so-called chairs.
The major part of juristic documents were written at the credible places as before.
They had a double task: they made authentic charters at the request of their clients and by the order of the king they took part in trials and recorded the events in charters.
Laws and the Triple Book
The role of laws called decretum (a contemporary word) slowly changed.
They did not follow customary law any longer, but new laws were created.
Matthias's law book of 1485, which was the first printed Hungarian law, had a significant role in this.
In 1514 Stephen Werbõczy was the first person to write down Hungarian customary law.
His work is called the Triple Book because of the numbering of the chapters.
These were not real laws, but due to its brief, clear style it became the most popular collection of customary laws until 1848, and it was re-published several times.
The Doctrine of the Holy Crown
The abstract idea of the state was not a recognised concept in late medieval juristic thinking, such a role being played by the doctrine of the Holy Crown.
According to this the crown represents the country in case there is no king, and the revenues and territory of the country were the inalienable property of the crown.
The rights of the estates and the Holy Crown were parts of a whole system: the will of the estates was enough to replace the crown with another crown, if there was no crown, as at the coronation of Ulaslo I.
According to the Triple book noblemen were members of the Holy Crown just as was the king himself.
SETTLEMENT AND PLACES OF LIVING
Towns
In his work summarising Hungarian customary law, entitled Tripartitum, Stephen Werbõczy accepted only the burghers of free royal towns as burghers with privileges.
According to him, burghers of all other towns were only serfs.
However, the hierarchy of towns was more complicated in reality, and it could not be based on the contrast of burghers and villeins.
There were about 30 free royal towns or towns with similar privileges in the territory of the country.
The most distinguished ones were the 7 so-called civitates tavernicalis: Buda, Kassa, Bártfa, Eperjes, Pozsony, Sopron and Nagyszombat, and they were legally and juristically different from other towns by the middle of the 15th century.
The 8th one became Pest at the end of the 15th century.
Besides these the so-called civitates personalis, such as Székesfehérvár, Esztergom, Lõcse, Kisszeben, Szakolca, and the royal mining towns (Selmecbánya, Körmöcbánya) and Transylvanian Saxon towns (Brasso, Nagyszeben) also had certain privileges.
But it was not only the burghers of these towns who were considered to be burghers.
The expression burgher was used for burghers of all bishopric towns, and also the burghers of distinguished market towns - regardless of their legal position.
The number of market towns in Hungary at the end of the Middle Ages was about 500, out of which 150 had a town-like appearance or performed urbanic duties.
Market towns played a very important role in the economic life of the country.
Free royal towns were usually situated along the border.
No towns were situated on two thirds of the territory of the country, the southern part of Transdanubia and the Great Plain. There was only one royal town in that region: Szeged.
However, the scantiness of the network of towns was compensated for by market towns: the most important ones - similarly to privileged towns - were trade and economic centers of a region, and besides these their church institutions, schools and in some cases their administrative function made them more distinguished than the neighbouring villages.
At the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century almost 15 % of the population of Europe lived in towns, but in Hungary this rate did not reach 10 %.
The combined population of Buda and Pest was between 15,000 and 20,000, that of Kassa and Szeged about 7,000, while in Pozsony it was 5,000, and in Sopron, Bártfa and Nagyszombat it was 3,500-4,000.
By this time the populations of Paris, Milan and Venice had each exceeded 100,000, so the Hungarian numbers were quite insignificant, even though in most parts of Europe the population of most towns was usually a couple of thousand people.
In neighbouring Styria, for example, Graz had a population of 7,000, and the outstanding merchant town, Pettau (today it is Ptuj, Slovenia) had 1,500 people.
The population of the biggest market towns in Hungary was about 1,000, but most of them had only a few hundred inhabitants.
The majority of towns were overcrowded, but this applied only to the areas within the city walls, not to the suburbs. In some places even the area surrounded by walls was not built up.
City walls built in the 13th and 14th centuries usually remained intact until the 15th and 16th centuries.
Meanwhile in several places huge areas were surrounded by walls and many fortresses had to be modernised because of the Turkish threat.
In 1473 one of the most important Hungarian towns, Székesfehérvár had to be fortified: the north-west rondella of the inner city, the rondella of the Buda gates, the barbacan of the Palota gates and the southern rondella were built then.
The king ordered villeins from counties Veszprém and Somogy to work on the constructions.
The wooden, earth and hedge fortresses of suburbs were built when they heard the news of the coming Turkish threat.
The massive rondella appearing on fortress and city walls was necessary because of the position of cannons.
High, thin towers, which were built earlier to dissect city walls, and high, thin city walls were not very protective against cannon balls.
When these heavy monstrous cannons were placed in position, defence also changed: high walls were destroyed and thicker ones were built and supported by earthworks, which also made them more flexible.
Previously built wall passes were also filled up with earth, and in the place of towers protective rondellas were raised. Cannons could be placed in any direction on the rondellas, so it was possible to shoot to the side (from a position in front of the walls).
Earth fillings could be found along the city walls, so defensive forces could move easily around the city.
Moats 20-40 meters wide and 1-7 meters deep also appeared at the outer part of the city walls. On the opposite side of them there was a counter-slope (contrascarpa): this was often made of earth with a stone wall, on which there was a covered road.
These were the forward positions of the defenders.
Previously built defensive gates had to be fortified, so the barbacans appeared.
The country had very little money for the fortification of suburbs as it was in a difficult economic situation at the beginning of the Turkish attack.
It was impossible to surround whole towns, so only the most important parts, necessary to the defence of the inner city, were protected by moats and earthworks (Fehérvár - Buda suburb).
Bigger territories of suburbs remained unfortified, and as the houses were usually made of wood they were often burnt down when under attack by the enemy.
Towns were often destroyed by fire.
Narrow streets, where houses were built very close together, and the use of flammable building materials made them very combustible.
There was a fire in Pest in 1512, when 24 houses burnt down.
Chimneys made of wood were also cleaned: in certain Hungarian towns Italian chimney-sweepers worked, for example in 1508 in Buda, Pest and Eger.
Although from the 14th-15th centuries a lot of churches and houses had brick vaults, it was not at all commonplace at the time.
Wooden shingles were replaced by ceramic tiles in Buda and Pest in this period.
These solutions decreased the number of burnt-down houses in the inner city, but in the suburbs there was no money for the new building material.
Outbreaks of fire could be explained by the fact that the water supply and sewage of towns did not develop until the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries.
Water was acquired from the nearby brooks, rivers, lakes and wells.
In Buda water was collected in cisterns even in the first half of the 14th century, and people drank the water of castle caves.
In luckier towns artificial wells appeared (Fehérvár).
In Nagyszombat, Beszterce and Brasso city brooks were built along the long streets.
The remains of fountains, wells and lead pipes found at excavations in the royal palace of Buda prove that there was a water-conduit after 1355-1366; but written sources mentioned conduits in Buda only from 1416.
The pipes of conduits were made of wood, lead and ceramics in the 15th century, then later they were made of iron.
Water pipes from the Sigismund period were also found in Buda and Pest.
Water was brought from the Buda mountains to the castle, and there were public wells at the end of the pipes.
The quality of the water, however, was not always satisfactory, this is why it was important and general to drink wine.
Public wells were placed inside and outside towns, and in medieval Fehérvár they could be found in the suburbs (Szentkirályfölde) and along roads, and near gates, too (Királykút).
There were wells in monasteries, palaces, in the yards of houses, and in several cases even in cellars.
Streets in the inner city were usually covered by paving-stones at this time.
These pavements were made of big, wide, flat stones or pebbles (Buda, Székesfehérvár).
The plan of streets, the form of blocks of houses, the size of plots of land did not change much till the first half of the 16th century.
However, land pieces were dissected, half plots of land became popular, but the plan of towns, and blocks of houses did not change.
The number of two-floor houses increased slightly, and plots of land were totally built up with long houses, which occupied the whole facade of the street (Székesfehérvár - 17 Megyeház street and 4 Oskola street; Buda - 18 Országház street).
Houses in towns had big, rectangular, late Gothic or renaissance windows, the special characteristic feature of which was the cross-shape partition.
Big shop windows with segment arch became very popular (Buda - the medieval houses of Uri and Tárnok streets).
The Turkish attack put an end to the development of flourishing city life, and in the following decades it resulted in the destruction of buildings and of medieval urban life. But at the same time it encouraged the modernisation of fortresses.
The Town of Visegrád
The origins of the town go back to 1285, when it was mentioned as a hospes settlement.
After 1323 the settlement became a town owing to the fact that the royal court moved there.
By the middle of the 14th century the town consisted of two parts.
The less significant part was the territory between the lower castle and the palace, which was inhabited by Germans.
The Hungarian part was situated at the Nagymaros ferry and along both sides of the St George brook (today Apátkúti brook).
Besides the judge at the top of the hierarchy one half of the 12-member council represented the Germans, while the other half represented the Hungarian part of the town.
After 1408, when the royal court moved, the town began to decline, but it was allowed to keep its privileges until the beginning of the 16th century.
In 1544 the Turks evacuated the Hungarian population, and with this the medieval town died.
The Royal Palace of Visegrád
The origin of the palace was king Charles I's town house.
It developed into an outstanding palace only in the first part of Louis I's reign. He ordered the construction of the buildings - the ruins of which we can still see today - at the end of his life. It was completed by his successors, Maria and Sigismund, at the end of the 14th century.
Until the first decade of the 15th century - when Sigismund moved his court to Buda - the royal palace of Visegrád remained the official residence of Hungarian rulers.
In the 15th century the palace became unimportant, and it was rebuilt by Matthias at the end of the 15th century.
From that time on until the 1544 Turkish occupation it was the countryside residence of Hungarian kings.
In the Turkish times it was severely damaged, and finally pulled down in the middle of the 18th century.
King Matthias started to rebuild the palace only after his marriage to Beatrix in 1476. He turned it into his country residence.
The construction may have taken 10 years.
The old buildings were totally renewed, and a new wing was raised on the street facade.
The windows, fire-places, roofs, wells, loggias and balconies were changed.
The constructions were led by the court judges of Buda. The work was performed by the local late Gothic architecture workshop, but some partial tasks were performed by Italian masters who worked in the renaissance style.
The Castle of Visegrád
The castle of Visegrád, which was built after the Tartar invasion, consisted of two parts: a fortress with the old tower and a gate tower, and the lower castle fortified by guard towers which was connected to the fortress by a wall.
The sextagonal living tower was in the lower castle.
Charles I had the living tower rebuilt and an inner wall built around it.
The palace wings of the fortress, its moat and the second wall were built in the Angevine age.
The Hungarian crown was kept in the fortress until the Turkish period.
Sigismund had another outer wall and a house (next to the old tower) built.
Matthias had the palace wings totally rebuilt and the fortifications modernised.
The hall on the first floor of the eastern wing and the room of the gate tower were given ribbed vaults.
Two arch-stones have survived from the vault of the gate tower with the coats-of-arm of King Matthias and Queen Beatrix.
In the lower castle yard there were farm buildings and the wall was made higher.
The wall pass in front of the old tower was filled up, and a new cannon terrace was formed.
From 1492 the fortress fell in to the hands of the crown guards chosen by parliament.
In 1543 the Turks occupied it, and then between 1595 and 1605 it belonged to Christians again for a decade.
The returning Turks finally left the fortress in 1686, but by then it was only a ruin.
Visegrád - Franciscan Monastery
After founding monasteries in the south, Visegrád was the first place in the center of the country where an observant monastery was established by king Sigismund at the beginning of the 15th century.
The circumstances of the foundation are known from Sigismund's letter to the Pope in 1425, in which he requested permission and privileges.
From this it can be seen that the observant branch of the Franciscan order (besides the conventuals) could not have been widely known, since the ruler described them and their activities in Hungary in detail.
The monks received a ruined chapel in Visegrád, which was consecrated in the honour of St George, and Sigismund also built a house for them, too.
The chapel was originally founded by Sigismund's "royal predecessors", that is one of the Angevine rulers, but it was out of use by the beginning of the 15th century.
This choice of place was quite unusual, as the Franciscans settled down in the neighbourhood of the royal palace of Visegrád, at the side of the city, but not at the edge of the city or in the city - as they used to do.
This fact suggests that the king wanted to give a special role to this monastery.
The Franciscans probably did not live in this house for a long time, since after 1425 they started to build a new church and monastery near the old buildings, which they wanted to consecrate in the honour of the Virgin Mary.
The vault of the sacristy and some cuts from later buildings must have originated from this period.
After Sigismund's death the monastery was not supported, so the buildings began to fall into decay.
At the end of the 15th century king Matthias planned to rebuild the monastery, but only his successor, Ulaslo II finished it at the beginning of the 16th century.
The church and the new vault of the monastery, and probably the tower above the sacristy were built then.
The connection of this new building to the royal palace was emphasised by the fact that there was a door on the northern side from the territory of the palace to the monastery.
So the ruler could enter the monastery without coming from the street.
The special position of the monastery is shown by the fact that there were no more than 8 monks living there at the beginning of the 16th century, and it had always been considered a monastery (usually 12 monks lived in a monastery).
In 1543 Visegrád fell into the hands of the Turks, so the Franciscans had to leave.
However, later there were a few Franciscan monks in each of the Christian armies which arrived, and they tried to describe the condition of their abandoned monastery. At the end of the 17th century, after the reoccupation, the monastery was not rebuilt, and in the 19th century even its ruins were destroyed.
It was forgotten for about 50 years, until in the 1980s excavations found the remains of the ruins.
Szentkirály - A Village on the Great Plains
Szentkirály was a medieval village in the northern part of the territory between the rivers Danube and Tisza, north of Kecskemét, and near to the road leading from Buda to Szeged (the great road).
The old settlement was marked in Student Lazarus' map, which was the first detailed map of Hungary, under the name S. Rex (Sanctus Rex).
The first church of the village was built in the 12th century in the honour of St Stephen, and even today he is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic church of Szentkirály in county Bács-Kiskun.
In the age of the Árpád dynasty Szentkirály was inhabited by people from the royal castle, as the village belonged to the castle bailiff district of Csongrád.
During the Tartar invasion it was deserted.
In 1354 it was presented by king Louis the Great to a Cuman noble family as an uninhabited estate - to Cuman Peter, son of Bõcsör (Bwchwr), and his sons, Michael and John, and his cousins, Baramuk, son of Kabak, and Gál, son of Wezteg - on the condition that they settle down there and live according to Christian traditions.
After the border visit of the Buda chapter in 1356, king Louis I gave a letter of privilege to the new owners.
The descendants of the family, the members of the noble Bicsak (Bychak) and Gáspár families, asked king Ulaslo II in 1493 for an official copy and confirmation of the charters in their possession.
In the same year the king gave the power of life and death to the owners, according to which they could judge the criminals caught on their estate.
The Cumans owning Szentkirály and their people chose to settle down in the place where the ruined church of the deserted Árpád-age village stood.
At the end of the 14th century the church was rebuilt and strengthened with buttresses, the plots of land for houses were distributed, and the first firm houses were built and the dead buried near the church.
This settlement was established in accordance with special "Cuman traditions", because in 1490 the village was marked as "Szentkirály szállás [accommodation]" together with the neighbouring Barabásszállás, which was the property of the same family (today's Borbáspuszta near Kecskemét).
The names of medieval Cuman settlements were formed with the help of the suffixes -szállása, -ülése, - népe, -háza (for example, Köncsögszállása, Csólyosszállása, Bagdasülése, Alonnépe, Bugacháza), to show that these were considered temporary settlements or family estates by the Hungarians even after their consolidation in the second half of the 14th century.
In Latin charters usually the word descensus [accommodation] referred to Cuman settlements.
Szentkirály was a flourishing settlement even in the 16th century, its population consisted of 50-60 families.
The first big decline took place in course of the 15-year war.
By the end of the 17th century the village was totally deserted.
At the end of the 19th century only the ruined walls of the medieval church showed that it used to be a village.
In place of the ruins of the church a Calvinist church was built in 1901, which still functions today.
The ruined late medieval village was found during excavations between 1969 and 1990.
Szentkirály was situated at the back of a hill, lying north-west - south-east on the territory between the rivers Danube and Tisza. On the north it was bordered by huge waters.
The main street of the village was on the crest of the hill to the length of 900 meters. On the two sides of the street there were the houses, usually 50-70 metres from each other.
The ruined domes of the medieval houses, made of clay and lime, rise as small dunes.
According to archaeological maps, there were about 30 houses on the surface.
The structure of the village was loose, consisting of rows of streets. This type of settlement was quite typical in the Great Plain.
During the excavations at Szentkirály whole farm-yards were found around some of the houses, so there are data about the arrangement of the inner part of the plots of land, and the economic condition and way of life of the families.
In the early phase of the settlement, in the 15th century, the arrangement of houses was parallel with the streets.
Behind the houses, in the farm-yards there were simple buildings: sties and stables of post or pillar structures, huts with woven hedge walls or reed walls, ditches for different products, pithuts, sties dug into the earth.
There were hardly any bigger farm buildings with firm walls (for example, stables, garages).
In contrast with this, the typical buildings of the inside of plots of land were open or half-open, enclosured places for animals, the walls of which were made of posts, twigs, branches of trees, reeds or other organic materials (for example, straw, dung, carex).
Similarly structured reeds with oval or rectangular ground-plans were known from ethnographic collections in the Kiskunság region.
Such arrangement of the inner part of the plots of land - with buildings for extensive animal husbandry inside the village - shows a special economic structure and way of life, in which animal husbandry played a very important role.
This structure of settlement has close links with the traditional farming of the Cumans, which was based on animal husbandry.
Nevertheless cultivation of plants might have been significant, too, in the 15th century, but no data has survived which can be dated before the 16th-century tax records.
The 15th-century houses found in Szentkirály are beautiful memories of the housing traditions of medieval peasants of the Great Plain.
The basic type of contemporary houses consisted of two rooms.
From the entrance we could go into the kitchen, and there was a room to the left or right.
If there was a third or fourth room, it must have been built later, and these rooms were used as pantries.
Modern heating equipment also spread on the Great Plain - earlier than in Transdanubia - at this time: in the covered rooms closed fire-places - coal stoves - were built, which were heated from the kitchen, so the room was not smoky any more.
For kitchen work - baking, cooking, drying, dehydrating, roasting - a huge, round oven was used, which stuck out from the back wall of the house.
This type of house - directly preceding the so-called middle Hungarian type of house, known from ethnography - was a milestone in Hungarian folk architecture.
It probably developed from the architecture of towns or noble-mansions, some time during king Sigismund's reign. Compared to other countries of Europe it was the most modern type of house in medieval villages.
In Cuman settlements this type of house appeared everywhere.
There was a detailed architectural reconstruction of a house which was built in the middle of the 15th century and burnt down in the first half of the 16th century. It was house No 25 and it had two rooms (it was 12.4 meters long and 4.9 meters wide).
The entrance was in the south-west.
The basic area of the kitchen was 24.5 square meters, and that of the room on the left was 22 square meters.
The walls were built with techniques such as hedge walls built onto post-skeletons, which belongs to the ancient techniques of Hungarian folk architecture.
The spaces between the wooden pillars and posts, which were dug into the clayey earth in ditches, were loosely woven with twigs, and then covered with mud and straw.
At the corners of the walls and below the main joist in the middle, baulks were used, and wreath beams were put onto the baulks in the corners.
Cross beams were put on these, then reed and twigs were put on top of these.
Above the oven there was a protective roof, supported by baulks.
This might have been covered with straw, as the burn marks on the floors of kitchens indicates.
In the rare corner of the kitchen - on the level of the floor of the room - there was a stove, built on a semi-circular clay edge. The coal stove and the fire space of the oven opened from here.
Above the stove there was a cover against sparks, woven from twigs.
The bottom of the oval oven (2.2 by 2 meters) was covered with broken ceramics to keep more heat in.
The foot of the stove in the room of house No 25, the basic area of which was 1.45 by 1.45 meters, was painted with white clay, similarly to the wall and floor of the room.
There was a cylinder-shaped upper part on the rectangular lower part, and the upper part was covered with a dome vault.
From the fragments of stoves tiles, which were found in great quantity among the ruins, seven types of stoves could be differentiated.
The position of stove tiles was fixed.
The dome and upper part of the stove were covered with onion-shaped stove tiles.
On the upper edge of the stove there were tiles imitating bastion tops.
The side of the stove was covered with smaller and larger glass-shaped, plate-shaped or triangular tiles in varying order.
Ceramic stove tiles were put into the side of the stove with their 'mouth' outside, except for the onion-shaped, helmet-like tiles, which were built into the vault with their tops looking upward.
The 15th-century village stoves were, of course, more simple than the stoves of rich noblemen, which were decorated with glazed tiles. But the Gothic forms and rich decorations of village stoves made them beautiful memories of applied folk art.
The thick layer of ruins of burnt down houses preserved the remains of dishes, kitchen equipment and tools.
In the kitchens smoky clay dishes were found around the fire-place.
There were some dishes in the rooms, too, sometimes they fell to the floor from the loft.
The bottom of stoves or ovens covered with ceramic tiles was a good hiding place for thrown-out and reused old dishes.
Broken dishes and other objects were found in pits around the houses.
The majority of these were ceramics, which were used for a very long time, even after they were broken or had a hole in them: if they could not use them for cooking, it was used for other purposes.
Smaller or larger pots, covers, mugs, jugs, jars and cups used in the household must have originated from different potters, according to their material and the way they were made.
Red, reddish-brown and white or white-grey pots without glazing were widespread.
Grey, shining jars, the burning time of which was reduced, were regularly used in the 15th century.
Yellowish-terracote, fine, polished jugs were rare, but they were found at each house - it seems that one piece was kept in each household.
Thick, grey pots, imported from Austria, were also found at each house.
There were fine dishes with green or yellow glazing, which were used at the table, but only fragments of these survived.
Glass products were also used at the table, and their fragments have been found.
Wooden dishes were quite commonplace, but hardly any of them have survived, only one wooden spoon was found between two layers of mud in a well.
The most general object in the households were knives, with wooden or bone hafts and bronze band.
In the 16th century several thousand knives were imported to Hungary from Austria.
However, the majority of iron tools were made by village smiths: scissors, awls, angles, hooks, nails, chains, drills, chisels, spits, grates; iron bands, locks for chests, coffins and doors...etc.
Tools and agricultural equipment were expensive, and they were rarely left on the earth, not like axes, hatchets, ploughs, spades, hoes, sickles, scythes and pitchforks.
A broken spade was preserved in the earth of a tomb: it was put into the tomb because of superstition, to protect the dead person from troubles.
Fragments of curb-bits and stirrups, buckles, spurs and horseshoes were also found.
Only the iron bands have survived from wagons.
The making of bone and horn tools was an ancient profession.
The inhabitants of medieval Szentkirály used the bones of animals to make tools.
Skates were made of the leg bones of horses, and these were fixed to the shoes, or they just stood on them pushing themselves forward on the ice with a stick ending in a pointed bone.
Awls, punchers, pegs, handles of tools were also made of bones, while whistles and needle-holders were made of bones of wild birds, which had hollows in them.
The memories of boneturnery were beads, bone belt mountings and buckles.
The pastern bone of horses were used for making toys for children.
WAY OF LIFE
ECONOMICS
There were three main farming systems in late medieval Hungary.
The most modern one was the threefold rotational system in the Transdanubian area, some parts of the Felvidék and the borderlines of the Great Plain in the 14th century.
In these places the significance of agriculture preceded that of animal husbandry, and animals were kept in stables.
Regulated soil changing was used in the Great Plain, which was a system of agriculture and animal husbandry at the same time, and animals were kept in the open air in fields.
In the woodlands of the Felvidék and Transdanubia lands were cultivated all the time; these fertilised lands were called torunoklands.
A two-way rotational system was probably not used.
In the threefold rotational system lands near the villages were cultivated: in one part autumn cereals, in another part spring cereals were sown, and the third part was not under cultivation, and called the waste land.
During the regulated soil changing system territories used for cultivation and animal husbandry were changed every 2-5 years in a changing rhythm.
The name of the land used for grazing ground was fallow land or field.
Torunoklands were right behind the gardens, and they included only a part of the village land, the other part being cultivated in the rotational system.
On the lands cereals were grown according to the climate.
Gardens were practically cabbage gardens, and fruits were very rare.
Woods, fishing lakes, and vineyards did not belong to the estate, and they were commonly used by the whole village.
Vineyards were considered waste lands because of the great amount of work they required, and different taxes and juristic regulations were used here, which were very suitable for villeins.
Vineyards were on the so-called hills, but storage and processing buildings were not widespread in the country: only pressing was done on the hill, all other work being done at village or town houses where wine was also stored.
In the southern part of the country, in Transylvania and in the Eastern Carpathians Rumanians and Rutenians, privileged with the vlach right, used moving animal husbandry in the mountains, and their main animals were sheep and goats.
They paid a sheep fiftieth tax owing to their different economic system.
HANDICRAFT INDUSTRY
The names and profession of several artisans were mentioned in city charters.
In the medieval Fehérvár they mentioned: a miller, a painter, a turner, a weaver, a tailor, a sword-maker, a locksmith, a saddle-maker, a cloth-maker, a copper smoulder, and a shoemaker.
In Sopron knife-makers, sword-grinders, smiths, tradesmen, butchers, goldsmiths, money-minters, tinmen, bow-makers, locksmiths, copper-smiths, turners, fire-makers and rosary-makers were mentioned.
In Buda there were cloth-makers, cutters, money-minters, bow-makers, knife-makers, tailors, spur-makers, tinmen, beer-makers, millers, fishermen, shoemakers, carpenters, stone-cutters, painters and coopers.
Generally the representatives of different professions worked in a separate part of the medieval town.
This is shown by the street names referring to professions.
The representatives of certain branches of industry (smiths, potters, skin-dressers, coopers, wheelers, weavers) had to move to the suburbs because of the danger of fire or their demands for large spaces or areas of water.
Medieval workshops of artisans - in spite of the appearance of guilds - were relatively small, and their technological development was slow.
According to tax records, at least 20-25 % of the inhabitants of medieval towns dealt with industries; and this proportion was bigger in western-European cities: 50-70 %.
The most important industry was clothes-making (furrier, tailor, shoemaker), but the metal- and military industry also played an important role.
One of the most popular professions was the goldsmith's, which served luxurious purposes.
There were copper-, silver-, and goldsmiths, and money-minters among them, and even picture-painters belonged to their guild.
Many of them were engaged in changing money and finance.
At the beginning of the 15th century several members of the jury, and even the judge of Buda, Judge Harber were goldsmiths.
At first the centre of this profession was Buda, since there were a lot of rich customers here due to the church and secular accumulation of treasure.
Later the goldsmiths of Kassa, Kolozsvár, Nagyszeben, Brasso and other towns became famous masters in the country.
The so-called wire enamel technique, which was used and developed in Hungary, became widespread in the country, and different products, especially chalices with rich motifs, were decorated with this technique.
According to archaeological data and the history of places we can state that in Buda goldsmiths lived in the Goldsmith street, in Cloth-maker street, Italian street, Saturday-market street, in the street north of the Church of Our Lady, near St John Franciscan monastery and near St George church.
Objects referring to the activity of goldsmiths were found in many places of Sopron and Székesfehérvár.
The most beautiful examples of the work of medieval goldsmiths were baptising pools and church bells made in the 15th-16th centuries.
One of the most famous bronze-casting workshop was in Igló (Neudorf, Spisska Nova Ves, castle district Szepes, today Slovakia).
The founder of the workshop, Conrad Gaal cast the big bell of Visegrád, by the order of king Louis the Great in 1357.
We have data about the activity of the Igló workshop until 1516.
Almost all bells and baptising pools in the Szepesség were made there.
The baptising pools of Gyöngyös, Bártfa, Kisselyk and Brasso are among the most beautiful medieval monuments.
One of the most typical medieval professions was tin-casting.
In Sopron in the 15th century there were eight casting houses - in accordance with the latest research.
Tin dishes (cans, jugs, plates, cups, flasks and washing equipment), candle-holders and even bullets were made there.
In important towns there were knife-makers everywhere.
According to scarce written sources they also worked in Kassa, Lõcse, Szeben, Pozsony, Buda and Sopron.
In spite of this fact - in accordance with archaeological observations - high-quality knives made by masters in Austria and Nürnberg were widespread.
Long medieval knives with thin blades were very popular; their hafts were made of bones or wood, and there were signs on them referring to the master and place of manufacture.
More and more people could afford buying nice glass cups and bottles, and used glass in their windows - which was then very expensive - to protect themselves from the cold and windy weather.
The windows of buildings, especially churches, consisted of small glass pieces framed in tin structures.
There were glass makers in the 14th century in Bars-Szklenó, near Selmecbánya and Körmöcbánya, where bottles, jars and plates were produced.
In all probability, there were more glass-making places in the 15th century, primarily in mining areas with wooded areas, in the Felvidék, Transylvania and other places.
Near Diósjenõ in county Nógrád the ruins of a glass-making factory were found.
A source from 1419 mentioned a Buda citizen, Anthony Olasz, who dealt with glass-making, but it is quite obvious that many more people were engaged in this activity.
During the 15th-16th centuries marvellous glass products were being made (cans, jars, bottles, cups and goblets).
One of the most typical contemporary dishes, the bottle - originating from the east, with round bottom, long, thin neck and wide, funnel-like mouth - must have been produced in Germany in the 15th century, and in Hungary at the beginning of the 16th century.
It was used for storing oil necessary for mass or other church ceremonies.
In Transylvania people drank 'cherry wine' from it.
Its one- or two-pipe variants, or spiral neck variants are also known.
Fine Venetian glasses were imported to medieval Hungary in great quantities.
Goblets and stemmed glasses had a marvellous finish and were beautifully made.
Glasses were very popular, and had various forms, as the Italian name implies ("incostatis", "de mucolis incostatis" = various).
The most popular findings of archaeological excavations were ceramic pots or their fragments.
The family names Cserep and Cserepes [potter] was already used in the 14th-15th centuries; in 1438 the name of Michael Fazekgyarto [potmaker] was recorded in a charter, and in 1504 the name Gallus Fazekgyarto.
Apart from these, family names Fazekas [potter], Gerencsér, Korsós, Téglás and Téglaégetõ [all connected to pottery] and the variants of these were of medieval origin.
One of the brickmakers living in Buda had the name Ziegelfuser.
Expressive place names, connected to pottery, were of medieval origin: Agyagosbérc, Agyagpáva, Agyagtelök, Agyagverem and Agyagszó.
The pots of 15th-16th-century potters were made on revolving discs, manipulated by foot.
One of the most widespread type of ceramics was the stove tile.
Onion-shaped, glass-shaped and square (at the mouth) tiles were the most popular ones.
The colour of the burnt-out clay was red, white and grey in this period.
Stove tiles with a yellow and green glazing were of several types, and represented buildings (castle), parts of buildings (copies of windows) religious scenes, coats-of-arms, shield animals, ornaments and contemporary persons (women's heads, knights), and animals of tales, legends and myths.
The royal workshop of the 15th century was very famous, on the stove of which king Sigismund's coat-of-arm and his palace were represented along with other beautifully made tiles.
The stove representing the "Three kings", made around 1469-1473, might have been the work of one of the best masters of contemporary Europe.
A stove reconstruction from the first third of the 15th century and the famous knight stove (1554-1557) prove the artistic skills of the masters of the period.
Other typical objects of the age were grey casting moulds for goldsmiths and distillers.
The most widespread kitchen dishes were various white, grey and red lids and pots (the pots were decorated with rib shapes on the outside), and there were three-legged pots with handles, which were glazed inside.
Grey Austrian imported pots were also popular.
Fine products were thin, white goblets decorated with engraved lines or rib shaped or white, yellow or red jugs and jars.
Mugs were red, grey and yellow, and they often had a loop.
Among glazed dishes found in Buda there were decorated or painted cups and hand-washers; as well as a lot of German and Czech ceramic fragments.
An important element of medieval everyday life was the use of water power.
Water was pumped into castles (Esztergom) or buildings (Fehérvár) into high places with the help of various lifting devices.
Machines using water power helped miners or industrial equipment.
However, the most popular machines using water power were mills.
They could be found along brooks and rivers everywhere, and mill ships floating on water were also a usual sight.
In the 15th-16th century there were several mills in bigger towns (Asszonypataka, Bakabánya, Beszterce, Buda, Esztergom, Fehérvár, Igló, Kassa...etc.).
Grain was ground with water power and big mill stones, but small grinding stones for hand-grinding were also used.
Contemporary bakers had their shops in every town, but usually in the suburbs because of the danger of fire.
Village bakers also played an important role, but there were wandering bakers, too, who had mobile, portable ovens.
Bread was made without leaven.
In the 15th century the Law book of Buda mentioned rolls and fine bread, but the poor ate brown bread.
Baker's products were also sold at markets: in Buda and Pozsony bakers had to sign their products with Roman numbers.
The family name 'Pereces' [petzel] appeared in charters after 1424, and the name 'Pék' (of German origin) [baker] also spread in the 15th-16th centuries.
From a 1484 charter the Zsemlesütõ [roll baker] street of Fehérvár is known.
In 1487 in Buda, roll baking master John Babocsai and his partner, Caspar Zsemlesütõ - who became a member of the jury of the town in 1503 - were mentioned.
There were several butchers in each medieval Hungarian town.
Their activities were broader than those of today's butchers'.
The selling of cattle abroad - the Hungarian cattle trade was quite significant - also fell into their range of activities.
Their guilds were the richest in the cities.
With their physical strength they kept order in the city, and as they travelled constantly, they often worked as postmen.
It is therefore clear why the butchers of Debrecen received postal privileges in 1478 and 1512.
The meat market of medieval Fehérvár was situated in the territory of Vicus Teutonicalis (German street), but there were also butcher's kiosks in the market place, some of which were next to the houses.
EDUCATION
Basic education was provided by chapter, town or parish schools.
There are numerous examples of these schools in various parts of the country, so we can be sure that by the end of the 15th century the country had a relatively uniform school network.
However, there may have been a tremendous difference between schools: in most schools in villages or market towns the parish priest was the teacher, himself, or a secular teacher ('magister ludi', or 'rector scolae'), who had gained his education in a similar school.
Chapter schools provided high-quality education, where the library supplied the students with the necessary spiritual background.
In these schools students usually went on to follow a church carrier, but the number of students who did not want to be a cleric gradually increased; in some towns the chapter and the town maintained a common school.
In the first grades reading and writing and elementary Latin was taught to young students, who were also taught by older students chosen for such work.
Latin grammar was taught from Donatus' Grammatics. Students had to study and learn the parts by heart.
This book contained the basic grammar in the form of questions and answers.
On the basis of the examples of the book students had to practise the declination of words.
Besides this the students participated in singing lessons, and learnt the calendar verses necessary for calculating the dates of certain feasts.
After acquiring a basic knowledge, in the middle grades students were taught the scientific system of Latin grammar, logic and Latin as a language.
After several years of learning, in the upper grades of the school students were given individual training, according to individual needs, and student groups were organised. In addition to this older students took part in the education of younger students.
The method of teaching and the curriculum were the same in chapter schools and town schools, the difference being only in proportions: in town schools the emphasis was on secular things.
The so-called Szalkai codex, Ladislaus Szalkai's school exercise books bound together, gave a good picture of what a clever student could achieve in the upper grades of the school - as Ladislaus Szalkai born into a craftsman's family in Mátészalka and later became the Archbishop of Esztergom proved.
When Szalkai attended the town school - he was 14-16 years old when he wrote his exercise books - he could speak good Latin, and also had beautiful handwriting.
In his six exercise books he copied and made notes on the material of the upper grades: the first contained calendar calculations, astronomy and medical science, the second music theory, the third the juristic expressions of family and kinship relations.
The fourth and fifth contained his literary studies, but the most important and most detailed material, the composition of letters, was in the sixth.
The verbal explanations of the dean were written in the margin, next to the main text.
A degree from a chapter school was enough for a student to get a job as a school master or clerk.
One did not have to go to university to acquire the customary law used in everyday life, as it could be acquired in practice, initially at royal chancelleries or in courts of law.
During his work a student who spoke Latin well could gain the necessary knowledge with the help of his experienced colleagues. With this knowledge he could get a job at a credible place, or in the service of a baron or a town.
The so-called formulariums, that is collections of charter samples, which were compiled on the basis of typical charters, helped in the practical training of lawyers.
Those who wanted to go to university, had to go abroad - except for some decades.
Hungarian students usually went to the university of Vienna or Krakow, which were quite near. However, from the second half of the 15th century more and more Hungarian people chose Italian universities - primarily in Padua or Bologne.
In the register of students and other records of Krakow university 3,000 Hungarian students were mentioned between 1400 and 1536. To accommodate them, a Polish nobleman, Nicolaj Bielonski, founded a separate bursa.
The students of the university of Vienna were divided into four natios, nations - one of these was the Hungarian natio, but all eastern European students belonged to this one.
The majority of students could not afford attending to university for a course lasting several years - as it was very expensive - so were not able to finish their studies.
They usually graduated from the faculty of humanities, the aim of which was to study the so-called 'seven free arts', to gain the necessary knowledge for further education.
After two years of studies they could get a baccalaureate degree, and after two more years they could reach the degree 'artium magister'. With the latter degree one could start to study law, theology or medicine.
Hungarian students who studied further usually chose law, their knowledge being required in diplomacy and at church courts.
At the beginning of 1465 king Matthias asked Pope Paul II to give permission for the foundation of a university in Hungary in a proper town.
The reason for the request was that because of great distances not all the talented young persons could go abroad to study.
On 18 July, 1467, the Archbishop of Esztergom, John Vitéz sent a letter to Pozsony, in which he declared that from king Matthias's will and with the agreement of the Pope a university was to be established in the town.
The Academia Istropolitana was the third experiment to found a university in Hungary: the first one being at Pécs, during Louis the Great's reign, and the second being a university set up in Óbuda during king Sigismund's reign, but both of them were closed after a couple of years.
The university of Pozsony fared no better than its predecessors: education started in 1467, and the first professors were the famous humanist scientists of the age, such as Johannes Regiomontanus the well-known German mathematician-astronomer, this did not prevent its closure after some years.
The fact that its founder, organiser and the first chancellor, Archbishop John Vitéz organised a plot against the king in 1471 also sealed the fate of the university.
Later on king Matthias supported the college of the Dominican order in Buda, the studium generale, but no university was formed from this institution.
EVERYDAY LIFE
Holidays and Weekdays
The everyday life of people was regulated by written and unwritten laws.
In the traditional system of medieval Hungarian law the emphasis was on unwritten, that is customary law, and written law was relegated to second place.
Hungarian customary law was written down at the beginning of the 1500s by Stephen Werbõczy, judge of the country, in a book entitled Triple Book, first published in 1517.
Alongside sources of law, which were used in the whole country, there were also town or county statutes.
These regulated the legal procedures of the local community, but there they were used for everything else too.
In the most important Hungarian town book, in the law book of Buda, the order of market sales were described in detail, in the same way a town was regulated.
The law book also regulated the celebration of holidays: courts of justice and shops were closed on Sundays and on holidays, and taverns could only be opened after the main service.
Those who worked in the fields on holidays had to pay a 1 mark fine.
In their law book the citizens of Buda followed church regulations, as the believers had two duties on holiday days: they had to attend the service and stop menial work.
Usually the church synods decided on the dates of the feasts.
In 1493 the synod of Esztergom and in 1515 the synod of Veszprém took steps to regulate the celebration of more than 50 feasts (plus Sundays), but the number of feasts really celebrated was far below the number declared by the resolutions of synods.
The most important feasts were Christmas, Easter and the days of patron saints of the church.
The procession was also a significant event in the church year - even the king, and his court took part in the one in Buda.
People's sense of the passing of time was insecure and inaccurate.
Years were identified by an outstanding event - such as a war, the king's succession to the throne or his death -, but days were related to feasts following each other.
The Hungarian names of months in the Middle Ages were defined by the first significant feast of the given month (for example, St Jacob's month, St Michael's month... etc.). The days when agricultural products were to be handed over were also connected to church feasts, just as were deadlines at courts.
The change in people's notion of time began with a new invention, which could measure time punctually: the clock.
Before the invention of the clock the passing of time was shown by the Sun, and time was measured by so-called canon hours, or praying hours, which divided the day into a 12-hour day and a 12-hour night.
Wheel clocks appeared in Hungary at the end of the 14th century.
At the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th century a clock tower struck the hours in Besztercebánya, Pozsony, Sopron, Kassa, Bártfa, Nagyszeben, on the cathedral of Várad and Eger and on the archbishopric palace of Esztergom.
Although sources make no mention of it, there must have been a clock near the Magdalena church of Buda.
Clothes
From the second half of the 15th century more and more written sources, contemporary illustrations, and even some original pieces of clothing have survived, but the identification of clothes mentioned in the source material or the validity of illustrations are questionable in several cases.
The dual style of Hungarian dressing habits - wearing eastern- and western-type clothes in the same period - changed slightly, yet remained typical.
Easter-type clothes - primarily Cuman - were replaced by special Hungarian ones, as contemporary foreign sources mention.
The most detailed descriptions originate from the descriptions of different royal celebrations - weddings, peace contracts, kings' meetings.
Eye-witnesses took notes and ministers wrote reports on Matthias's 1476 wedding, the kings' meeting at Olmüc or Iglau, the march into Vienna or Bécsújhely and Ulaslo II and Anna of Candale's wedding, and in each case they gave a detailed description of the pompous, richly decorated clothes made of expensive textiles, and the valuable jewels, weapons and harnesses of the king and his escort.
In December 1476 Matthias welcomed his fiancée near Fehérvár in a short coat decorated with pearls, and a gown also embroidered with pearls. When they marched solemnly to Buda, he wore a cloak decorated with precious stones, and at the wedding lunch had a yellow gown on his shoulders which had a sable lining.
At the coronation ceremony in Székesfehérvár his bride, Beatrix, wore a red and gold brocade dress made according to the latest Italian fashion.
When entering Buda she wore a blue dress and a guilt gown, and at the wedding lunch she wore a red dress woven with gold thread, which was decorated with sable.
The clothes of Hungarian noblemen, who appeared at the wedding, were also very elegant: Nicholas Újlaki's clothes, for example, were decorated with gold, silver, pearl and precious stones.
According to sources, Matthias was also concerned about the clothes of his escort.
According to the reports of the minister of Boroszló, he arrived in Fehérvár at the lead of 3,000 knights.
The pages of the king wore clothes made of yellow, grey, green and brown velvet.
The minister of Ferrara, Cesare Valentini, gave a detailed description about the kings' meeting at Iglau (1486), at which he admired the clothes and weapons of the escort and Hungarian noblemen.
Matthias also put great emphasis on military clothes. He provided his army with not only proper weapons and armour, but also supplied them with sheepskin fur coats and gloves.
Men's Clothes
Descriptions which focused on the difference between the clothes worn by the Hungarians and those worn by western European people were very valuable.
On the basis of sources we can state that in the 15th century in Hungary people wore special clothes.
It was known about Pipo Ozorai, king Matthias's famous commander and ispán [bailiff] of Temes, that despite his Italian origins he dressed like a Hungarian: he had a long beard, shoulder-length hair, and his clothes reached the ground, "according to the habits of those people".
The minister of the Prince of Milan also warned his lord that his representatives should wear long clothes, since at king Matthias's court short clothes, made according to Italian-Burgundian fashion, are not preferred.
Men's clothes in Hungary in the 15th century consisted of a shirt and trousers as underwear, and a dolman worn over them, as well as a short fur-lined or sheepskin coat.
At special occasions people wore gowns made of expensive materials, and these preferred by Ozorai too.
Hungarian people had unique hair styles and wore high (fur) caps.
Their trousers were simple in general, only their colour being unusual, but the dolman covered the greater part of the trousers.
The Hungarian shirt - according to the description of Hippolit Estei, archbishop of Esztergom, then bishop of Eger - was long, folded at the neck, and on the basis of both written sources and illustrations, was decorated with embroidery on the neck, chest and the end of the sleeves.
The dolman, worn over the shirt, was often made of silk or velvet, or sometimes fur for rich people, but it was worn by everybody in a less elegant form.
The dolman usually reached down to the knees, but according to Cesare Valentini's notes, Hungarian noblemen wore short upper clothes, that is dolmans, for riding.
There are only a few descriptions of fur-lined coats, but several sources mentioned sheep-skin coats.
King Matthias wore a decorated coat on his shoulders, that is a fur-lined coat, on one of the days of his wedding.
The most typical Hungarian item of clothing was the sheep-skin coat. It was worn by everyone, from the king to the shepherd, the only difference being in the material and style of sewing.
The Hungarian sheep-skin coat had buttons at the front, and it was a long cloak or gown with fur lining inside.
The fur coat of the king or dignitaries was made of brocade and silk with ermine or sable fur.
The employees of the royal chamber wore beech marten-skin coats, and guards wore sheep-skin coats, but the shepherd of the Archbishop of Esztergom also received a sheep-skin coat - according to Hippolit Estei's book of accounts.
There were different caps and hats for different clothing. Hungarian-type caps had an embroidered or fur rim and a feather decoration with pearls and precious stones in the middle.
Hungarian hair styles were also different from the European fashion: as it was mentioned about Pipo Ozorai, in Hungary long hair and a long beard were common.
In 1489 in Milan, Matthias's minister Moses Buzai, produced a sensation, when he wore his hair in long plaits decorated with pearls.
Boots, which were considered typically Hungarian, appeared first in the 15th century, under Turkish influence.
From the first half of the 15th century the armour of the members of the heavy cavalry consisted of a plate armour covering the whole body and the necessary weapons.
Palatine Emeric Szapolyai and his brother, Stephen, and Thomas Tarcai, Matthias's famous commander, were represented in such an armour on Emeric Szapolyai's tombstone in Csütörtökhely.
The clothes of the members of light cavalry were totally different: by the turn of the 15th-16th centuries Hungarian hussar-type clothes appeared as a result of Turkish influence, which consisted of a long gown, a hat with an ostrich feather decoration and Turkish boots.
The earliest hussar illustration survived from around 1500 on a sabre, but we could find hussars on cuts representing Emperor Maximilian's life.
The main weapons of heavy cavalry were the spear and the sword, which might have been supplemented by the dagger and the club.
War spears were about 4 meters long, and they were hung onto a hook on the breast plate during attacks.
The hands of the knight were protected by a big round disk, and this also ensured the safest position for holding the spear.
In the 15th century swords became larger - in order to be more effective against plate armour -, the most popular ones being over 1 meter in length. They were heavy and had a double edged blade.
In Hungary a special type of club, the so-called feathered club was used, and according to written sources there was also a special Hungarian dagger.
The weapons of the light cavalry in the 15th century were the sabre, the spear and the bow, but clubs or battle axes were also used.
The most widespread type of sabre was the hussar sabre, copied from Turkish models. It had a single blade, which was slightly curved, and its hilt was straight and wide.
Hungarian sabres with curved hilts turned up in the 16th century, and they became the most popular weapons.
Warriors both in the heavy and light cavalry used shields to protect themselves.
Shields were usually made of wood, with their surface covered with leather or linen, but the hussars often used small, round shields woven from reeds.
Women's Clothes, Jewels
Women's clothes did not change much during the 15th century.
They consisted of two parts: a shirt, underwear, and a dress, as upper clothes, which was called skirt.
The dress was cut around the neck, so the neck of the shirts - which was visible - was decorated with embroidery and pearls. Women in cities wore dresses with closed necks.
Women's hair was covered by veils or scarves, and only unmarried girls could go out without covering their heads.
In cold weather a cloak was worn over the dress, but according to sources there were sheep-skin coats for women too.
There is substantial information about the clothes of three queens: Beatrix, Anna of Candale and Maria Habsburg.
Only written sources reported about the clothes of the first two queens, but one of the elegant items of clothing belonging to Maria, Louis II's wife is the treasure of the Hungarian National Museum.
Maria's wedding dress was a deeply cut, green, silk-damask dress, and she wore a white linen shirt under it, which was decorated with silver embroidery on the neck and sleeves.
The material of the dress was made in Italy and it was made in accordance with the latest German renaissance fashion of the beginning of the 16th century - which was just about to form.
Queens usually had dresses made according to Italian, French or German fashions. However, in the 15th century there was a special Hungarian dress - which was very difficult to restore.
In 1457 Ladislaus V sent a Hungarian dress to his French fiancée, Princess Magdalena, and similarly Matthias gave a Hungarian dress to Beatrix, then to his son's fiancée, Bianca Maria Sforza.
Typical Hungarian clothes were sheep-skin coats with fur and the pearled Hungarian head-dress, which was also given to Beatrix by Matthias.
Clothes were supplemented with decorative jewels for both sexes.
We have detailed descriptions about Matthias's and Beatrix's jewels, none of which have survived.
Cesare Valentini mentioned Matthias's ruby-pearl crest.
His clothes were decorated with precious stones and a necklace with precious stones and pearls.
In 1499 Beatrix took orders concerning her ruby-pearled brooch and gold necklace decorated with diamonds and emeralds.
Barons also had such valuable jewels: Michael Újlaki, the Bosnian king, wore a gold necklace at Matthias's wedding, and the locket hanging from it was decorated with a huge sapphire stone and 300 smaller diamonds.
There are several testaments concerning jewels: in the testament of Moses Buzai - who caused a sensation with his unusual hair style with pearls - a valuable gold necklace, precious stones and rings are mentioned among others.
As well as the jewels in Buzai's testament (he was a landowner in county Tolna), there was a treasure find, excavated in Tolna.
Gold-plated silver dishes and jewels were hidden from the Turks in the 16th century. The owners of these must have been wealthy local tradesmen.
Gold-plated silver renaissance jewels - belt and dress hooks, a hanger with a grenade apple decoration, and a fragment of a necklace were found among the treasure.
Furniture
There were big changes in Hungarian homes during the 15th century: the number of pieces of furniture increased, and new pieces of furniture appeared, which were made to a high technological standard.
As well as furniture made by timber-work, the production of furniture made by joinery started in this period.
Joiners appeared in Buda at the beginning of the 15th century, and by the end of the century joiners' guilds were formed in each significant town. For example, in Kassa, in 1459, they had a common guild with wheelwrights and turners.
The most important piece of furniture was the chest, which was used for storing different things: articles of consumption, textiles and agricultural products.
Besides this it was used as a seat: according to Mrs Kottaner's memoirs, on top of the chest made for storing the crown there were velvet pillows - probably to make sitting more comfortable.
Cottage-shape chests, which were made as timber-work and followed German fashion, were used only for storage. They appeared in Hungary from the beginning of the 15th century.
One of the most beautiful examples of these was found in Rozsonda, near Nagyszeben, and its value lies in its figurative decoration.
In the second half of the century a new piece of furniture appeared - the wardrobe. It was made by putting a chest on its side or putting two chests one on top of the other.
On one of the boards of the altar of Jánosrét there were two pieces of furniture next to each other, both of them stood on a base.
The development of furniture making is shown by a bookshelf made in 1480 for the St Egyed church of Bártfa, which was recessed to the wall in its original place.
Wall-cupboards were made at several places in this period: only the doors of the cupboard and the frame around the boot being made of wood.
In this period tables, which could be put together or taken apart became permanent pieces of furniture.
Several illustrations of tables have survived from the 15th century: on tableaus it is possible to see tables covered with table-cloths, and these tables were either square or round.
The earliest Gothic tables have survived from the end of the 15th century, and the beginning of the 16th century. They were the so-called 'cradle' tables, which looked like cradles and had a lower storage section, or they had big drawers.
The back of beds at the head and legs also became popular at that time, and from the second half of the 15th century baldachin above the head became widespread.
According to tableaus there were various pieces of furniture used for sitting.
The simplest one was the cross-legged wooden bench, on which several people could sit at the same time, but there were three-legged round or square chairs too.
There were chairs with woven sitting parts, with or without backs, and armchairs were made for wealthy customers.
Armchairs could have high square shape backs or they were diagonally joint (usually folding) 'scissor-chairs'.
From the middle of the 15th century a new piece of furniture also appeared in churches, the stallum.
There are hardly any data about the furniture of royal palaces, but there was a quite detailed description of Matthias's library at Buda, and the furniture at his famous dinners.
In the library room there were three-legged chairs covered with guilded blankets, and the books were placed into bookcases decorated with inlays or they lay on bookshelves in rows of three.
At Matthias's wedding lunch there was a round table for the royal couple and a ten meter-long table for the guests in the Friss palace.
Dishes could be seen on one large and eight smaller cupboards, on which there were about a thousand gold and silver dishes.
The royal cupboard was guarded by two big silver unicorns.
From among Matthias's table decorations the most beautiful were the animal-shaped dishes, a marvellous silver ship, the pure gold dishes of the royal couple and Matthias's pepper-mill, which was supported by two lion figures.
However, only a very few of these have survived, and only a couple of silver goblets, and the most valuable of what are known only from descriptions.
However, some pieces from the china-set of the royal couple have fortunately survived, as did two glasses from Matthias's set.
It was not only the ruler who had valuable table dishes.
In Moses Buzai's testament a lot of cups, plates and bowls were mentioned.
He had more than one hundred spoons, which were very rare at the beginning of the 15th century. He also had 16 forks, which was a brand new thing at the end of the century.
His coral pepper-mill might also have been a valuable piece - he may have bought it abroad.
Ambrus Sárkány from Ákosháza was a well-known person in the Jagello age, whose treasures were found at Kölesd in the previous century.
Six pieces are known from the guilded silver findings: a goblet with lid, a cup and four drinking cups.
