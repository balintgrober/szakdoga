KISKUNHALAS LACE MUSEUM
In the small town of Kiskunhalas, located in southern Hungary, the tradition of lace making dates back around 100 years.
During the last century, the lace produced in Kiskunhalas was a worthy rival to the lace produced in Brussels, and it received the top prize in several world exhibitions.
Many famous personalities, including Pope John Paul II, the wives of the French and Czech presidents, the Empress of Japan, and Queen Elizabeth II of England, have received this traditional Hungarian product as a gift from the Hungarian State.
The lace is made from gossamer-thin, tightly twisted linen thread, and the art requires enormous patience.
The work is extremely time-consuming and meticulous, which makes the price of lace per gram comparable to that of gold.
The lace is produced according to century-old designs, and traditional motifs are still in use today.
The permanent exhibition at the Lace Museum provides an insight into the past and present of lace making in Kiskunhalas.
Visitors can follow the process of lace making and marvel at this beautiful and highly skilled craft.
