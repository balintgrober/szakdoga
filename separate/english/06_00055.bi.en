Entrepreneurs are developing Balaton infrastructure out of pocket
Real estate experts from both countryside and Budapest believe that the time of poor-quality mass products is over.
In Gyõr, Szombathely, Siófok and Szeged, demand for new apartments may be rekindled, which could spell revitalization for other entrepreneurial spheres. These are the claims of Balaton-side developers, according to whom their example could be beneficial to others.
Despite pessimistic market analyses, several entrepreneurs believe that certain segments of the Balaton real estate market could prove serious competition even for vacation spots in other countries, especially in the highly positioned luxury segment.
One example is the HUF 13 billion Galerius Resort, a site of residential properties, a yacht harbour, a wellness complex and spa.
Engels&Völkers will act as exclusive distributor for one of Balaton’s largest real estate investment projects.
Company spokesman István Mozsár expects that the Balaton properties will pique the interest of tourists and investors arriving from Germany and Austria in addition to the Hungarian market.
Luxury-segment specialists Engel&Völkers are acting on analyses according to which vacation homes at Balaton suiting every need may be purchased for HUF 18-25 million today. The firm also agrees that, despite fair prices, oversupply is great and thus several thousand unsold properties can be found in the area.
This accounts for a drop in prices of up to 15% within the last three years.
At the same time, the quality and quantity of the water is ideal, and thanks to the highway and other infrastructural developments, a rise in prices at Balaton can be expected, said the Engels&Völkers director.
Balaton’s tourist industry entrepreneurs are also welcoming the Siófok investment.
More than a thousand newly built apartments are expected to be opened in the near future, attracting a buyer pool that demands high-quality services on shore as well as in their apartments.
For this reason, small businessmen around Batatan have joined forces and renewed Siófok’s answer to Váci utca, The Petõfi Promenade, out of pocket.
Due to an investment of over HUF 150 million, the area has been equipped with security cameras, and the street has received a new stone covering, said Petõfi Promenade Ltd co-director Gábor Varga. Entertainment venues and restaurants have also been renewed. Varga himself is the owner of the Renegade Pub in Siófok.
As we have learned, the local government also provided substantial assistance to the refurbishment.
Those doing business on the street were provided with an opportunity to create terraces and sign long-term agreements with contractors for the operating rights to the Siófok rentals.
The owner of Renegade Pub added that this type of municipal-entrepreneur joint consideration could assist in the development of all areas where the state is battling lack of sources.
In Szombathely, they are less optimistic about interest from foreigners, especially Austrian investors.
Tamás Schmidt, co-owner of the 360-unit Hunyadi Residential Park in Szombathely, opines that though it is still worth building residential parks today, the times when apartments could be sold straight off the drawing boards are past, with residential parks on top of one another, even in Szombathely.
`This is not a problem, since at last some kind of competition has evolved where not merely the hunger of the demand market dominates` said Schmidt. `Instead the question of quality and reliability has come to the forefront.
Today, it’s not possible to sell hastily thrown together, mediocre-quality apartments.
Perhaps this will slowly quell amateurishness and speculation in the worst sense of the word`.
As for whether any residential real estate is invested in by Austrians, Schmidt said that the Austrians hadn’t bought apartments here before and will not hereafter.
At the same time, he added that investor groups cannot be expected to purchase properties here with the intent of renting them.
In America, he explained, practically everyone lives in rental properties and do not strive to change that.
In Hungary, the rental property phenomenon has evolved in a completely different direction over the past fifty years, since a scarcity of property has become permanent.
Everyone would like their own home, stated Schmidt. `This has been coded into our viscera.`
The builders of the residential park are nonetheless unafraid that the apartments will go unsold due to market stagnation.
`Competition has already developed on the market, and people are picking and choosing from among offers.
This is definitely advantageous for those who build with true expertise and competence.
That’s what we’ve done before, [so] we have no reason to fear.` At the same time, Schmidt added that the area’s property market will budge only when, in similar fashion to Gyõr or Szeged, highways will reach Szombathely.
Hunyadi Residential Park owners believe that it is a proven and widely acknowledged fact that the economy strengthens in areas to which highways lead.
According to Schmidt, this is true for the real estate market as well.
People prefer to buy apartments where there is infrastructure, where there are roads.
