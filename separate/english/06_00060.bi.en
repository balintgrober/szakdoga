Colliers Bratislava office expands, relocates
Just over a year ago, Colliers re-opened its Bratislava office with a staff of three.
One year later, the staff is already six people and the company is moving to larger premises in the city centre.
Today, Colliers has dedicated teams covering office, industrial and retail properties as well as a group providing independent property valuation.
Tomas Krcula, Colliers Slovakia managing director, expects to see at least ten employees in the office by the end of the year, which would allow the company to provide a full range of service across the country.
