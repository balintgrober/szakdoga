Kimmo Pohjonen is a Finnish musician-magician who sends out uncontrollable energy waves during his concerts. He is bringing his magical instrument to Budapest and will perform on October 15th on the A38 ship.

Concert
Rainforest 21

Movie
Eros
Eros represents a unique moment in film history. It is an anthology consisting of three medium-length films of eroticism and love, and it was created by three world famous directors: Wong Kar Wai, Steven Soderbergh and Michelangelo Antonioni.
All of them approach this ancient mystery in their own special way. Wong is painfully emotional, but at the same time tells a very explicit story. Soderbergh's film has an acrid humour and is an innovative comedy. Finally, Antonioni gives us a philosophical meditation about the abyss between man and woman.
International Formation Dance Festival
For 30 years, Miskolc has been hosting this high-ranking dance event where the participating groups compete in standard, Latin and ballroom dance categories.
The competition is concluded by a grand gala that proudly presents the best national and international dancers.

Their Budapest concert is based on the works of two legendary contemporary German musicians, Nicolaus A. Huber and Helmut Lachenmann, although they are not very well known in Hungary.
