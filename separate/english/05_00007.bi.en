Take part in First Tuesday Budapest
First Tuesday is a business networking event that addresses the needs of innovative companies employing communication technology to increase their business results.
First Tuesday launched in Budapest in September 1999.
As part of the European Commission's NETIES program, First Tuesday helps technology innovators take part in Framework 6 projects to conduct joint research and development.
The overall project objective is improving SME participation and success rates in the 6th Framework Programme and ensuring more effective and faster integration of the associated candidate countries when building the European Research Area.
The project is building on experience of three chapters of the First Tuesday business network connecting a large number of community members actively cooperating in Central and Eastern Europe.
The stress is put on innovation and entrepreneurship support, especially in knowledge economy development, which has been identified as the regional weak point.
