PREHISTORY
The Origins of the Hungarian People
In the second half of the 19th century, linguists showed that the Hungarian language is related to the Finno-Ugric languages, or to be more precise, to the language of the Uralian peoples.
The Hungarians, who live in the Carpathian Basin, are separated from them by a huge geographical distance, with their various relatives living mainly in Northern and Eastern Europe, and east of the Urals, across enormous territories expanding from Siberia to the Baltic Sea. Even by twentieth century standards of transportation, they are hugely scattered.
The peoples speaking these languages are today's Finns, Estonians, Karyalans, Lapps, Lives, Ishers and Votes by the Baltic Sea; the Mordvins and Cheremis people (Maris) on the upper reaches of the river Volga, and the Votyaks (Udmurts) and Suryens (Komis) along the Kama river, the Voguls (Manyshis) and Ostyaks (Hantis) east of the Urals - the mountains that nominally separates Europe from Asia - and the Samoyed peoples (Nyenyets, Enyets, Nganasans and Selcups), who live in the east and north.
Linguists have shown that the Hungarian language has lived an independent life for thousands of years.
The linguistic community of the Uralian and the Finno-Ugric peoples broke up thousands of years ago, and some of its elements developed more or less independently from one another.
This is why the Finno-Ugric peoples who live far apart do not understand each other's language any more.
An example of the importance of distance in contributing to the independent evolution of a language can be seen with the Slavic peoples. They separated "only" one and a half thousand years ago, but they can still communicate with one another without an interpreter.
The Uralian peoples speaking related languages used to live close to one another.
To define their former homeland - the original home - the vocabularies of geographical features from the Uralian original language (which can be reconstructed from the ancient word-stock of today's Uralian languages) are available for us.
On the basis of these words it has been pointed out that in the 6th-4th millennia BC the community of Uralian peoples lived around the Urals (this is where they got their names from), mainly on the eastern side.
On the basis of the archaeological findings we can state that in the 4th millennium BC the majority of the Uralian peoples lived in the middle and south of this huge mountain range, on its eastern slopes.
Certain groups might have started their migration from here towards the east and west somewhere between 4000 and 3000 BC.
Those who left for the west later reached the Baltic shores, while the other group in the east came to the region of the Altai-Sayan.
The members of the Ugric community (that included the ancestors of today's Hungarians and Ugrics of the Ob) must have stayed on the territories east of the Urals - which explains why the language closest related to the Hungarian is that of the Voguls and the Ostyaks.
The Uralian peoples subsisted on fishing and hunting.
They settled down near rivers and lakes, where in the summer they lived in tents covered with the bark of birch trees, in the winter in houses dug into the ground.
A big part of their memories of material culture were preserved by the depth of the ground, or later in swampy regions by peat-bogs. Stone tools, objects carved from bones and wood, animal shaped sacrificial wooden pots and drinking cups, miniature statues of human and animal shape have come to light during archaeological excavations.
Their weapons were bows and arrows. They travelled on sleighs and skis in winter.
Evidence of their beliefs and arts survived on rock paintings found on the eastern slopes of the Urals. They represent human and animal shapes and celestial bodies in the company of magic signs and signs of clans.
During the 2nd millennium BC there were big changes in the lives of the Finno-Ugric peoples, which is shown by both linguistic and archaeological findings. As a result of the influence of peoples in the south, who spoke ancient Iranian languages, tilling and animal husbandry were slowly adopted.
In the place of these settlements and burial places of the Bronze Age bones of domesticated animals (cow, sheep and horse) and seeds of plants (wheat, barley and millet) were found.
The golden age of metalwork, which was reached at the same time, was in the 16th-14th centuries BC.
On territories in Western Siberia and Eastern Europe where Finno-Ugric peoples lived, bronze objects with a high lead content were widespread, and the place where these objects were made was the region of Ob-Istis rivers, judging from the casting mould findings. At that time lead was mined only in the far Altai mountains.
Additionally, the Hungarian words meaning "tin" and "lead" from the Ugric age, "gold" and some elements of the word-stock of animal husbandry are of ancient Iranian origin.
Evidence for the existence of animal husbandry in the Ugric age comes with the Hungarian words for cow and milk.
Besides the spread of keeping cattle and sheep, felt is an important contribution, since this thick material made of wool could serve as a covering material of the summer tents.
The words for horse, saddle, halter (snaffle), whip and stirrup were introduced in the Hungarian and Ob-Ugrian languages at that time, too.
In the northern zone of the Western Siberian steppe and in the zone of grovy steppe north from it, archaeologists have found traces of not only extensive, but also stabled animal husbandry from these times.
According to their burial traditions the dignitaries were given food-, drink- and animal-sacrifice.
As provisions for the journey after death, meat and milk (kumis) were placed next to the dead body in different pots.
Cows, sheep and horses were sacrificed in their honour, and the bones of the piled up animals were placed into the grave or onto the pile raised above the dead.
Not only grinding stones, but also seeds of grain-crops and sickle findings refer to the nature of Hungarian farming at that time.
The loan-word meaning (farm)wagon was introduced into the Hungarian language in the Ugric age, and it might refer to the same influence in education that originates from the ancient Iranian people, whose burial traditions with (farm)wagons were known much earlier, from the 3rd millennium BC.
The traditions of the so-called horse burial may have originated from them, too.
This was to become the typical distinguishing feature of the Hungarians in the age of the Conquest: the meat of the sacrificial horse was eaten, the skin - with the head and legs of the animal inside - was placed next to, or above the dead body.
The way towards independence
The most important stops on the east-west migration route of the Hungarians towards becoming an independent people were the following: Western-Siberia, Magna Hungaria along the Kama river, Levedia and Etelköz on the South-Russian steppe and finally the Carpathian Basin.
The pre-Hungarians might have left the community of Ugric peoples in Western Siberia at the end of the Bronze Age, at the beginning of the Iron Age - between 1000-500 BC.
Since that time we can talk about independent, pre-Hungarian people.
They may have lived in the southernmost regions of the home of Ugric peoples, in the grovy steppes along the Irtis-Isim-Tobol rivers.
At that time, a new technique of farming evolved in this region, which was important for a very long time: nomadic grazing, riding nomadism.
The consequent mobile lifestyle made the pre-Hungarians leave the territory of their Ob-Ugrian linguistic relatives.
Since that time, the ancestors of the Hungarian could call themselves "magyar" (the two elements of the word are magy+er.
According to one theory, the meaning of this name of the people is "speaking man", according to another theory it means "man-male").
The important elements of the development of ethnic consciousness are the language, the costumes and the traditions - things that differentiated them from others, and strengthened the feeling of belonging together.
The belief in a common ancestor was a contribution to this, its reflection was the legend of the origin of the Hungarians' ancestors.
The legend of the mythical stag - preserved in the Kézai chronicle - is supposed to originate from these times, too, as the southern neighbours of the ancient Hungarians were the Sarmatas, related to the Skitas, who spoke Iranian.
The Skitas had a special respect for the stags.
The shields of their dignitaries were decorated with the figure of a golden stag.
The name of the Asian Skitas (Sakas) means "the people of the stag".
The findings on the grovy steppes of Sargatka, Western Siberia, (6th century BC - 5th century AD) can be connected to the memories of ancient Hungarians, the characteristic features of which were nomadic farming and the traditions of horse burials.
At around the 5th century AD a great migration - of unknown origin - pushed the Hungarians to the west, to the territory of today's Europe: somewhere between the middle reach of the river Volga and the Ural mountains. In 1236, a Dominican friar, Julianus, found traces of the Hungarians who stayed in the east, and he called this region Magna Hungaria, or "old Hungary".
Their archaeological remains were found in the 1980s, near the village Bolsije Tigani: in the tombs dating from the 8-10th century objects were found such as horse remains, funeral shrouds woven with silver thread, as well as further metal objects related to the metal works of the conquering Hungarians - belt-mounts, jewellery, accessories and weapons.
At around 700-750 the majority of Hungarians supposedly migrated further from Magna Hungaria, now to the south along the Volga river.
A minor group preserved its language for more than five hundred years; their fragments might have been found by friar Julianus in that region.
In the very same year (1236), however, the Tartars, pressing forward from the east, destroyed their settlements on the territory in contemporary Bulgaria along the Volga, and after that there was almost no mention of the Hungarians who stayed behind in their original home - they might have integrated with the population surrounding them.
At the region of the meeting of Volga and Káma rivers, in the town called Chistopol a tombstone from 1311 came to light, on which we can read: "This is the tomb of Ismagil, son of Magyar khadi".
Levedia and Etelköz
In the second half of the 6th century, the Turkic Empire gained great importance in Eurasia.
In the middle of the 7th century the Khazar Kaganate came into being at its western border. The Hungarian people were in their sphere of interest at the end of the 8th century.
Their relationship was sometimes a closer, sometimes a looser bond.
The subordinated relationship that may have lasted for some time ended in the 830's. Its significant sign might have been the building of the brick fortress, Sarkel, against the Hungarians in about 838, on the left bank of the river Don.
The Khazars set examples for the Hungarians in several fields, as in the field of power relations.
The first chief prince of the Hungarians was Levedi; the succeeding generations named the territory in the region of the Don after him (Levédia).
The Byzantine emperor, Constantin, called the dwelling-place (where they had lived before they came to the Carpathian Basin) of the Turkic people (=Hungarians) Etelköz (the territory between rivers) in his work written in the middle of the 10th century.
The location of the two territories, Levédia and Etelköz, is uncertain.
Nevertheless, the ancestors of the Hungarians presumably left the Don region at the beginning of the 850s, and moved toward the west, to the region of the rivers Dnyeper-Dnyester-Prut, where their power extended to the Lower-Danube and the Eastern-Carpathians.
In the meantime, the Hungarians grew both in population and in knowledge when the Eskils, who spoke Bulgarian-Turkish, joined them along the Volga. According to certain researchers, they were the ancestors of the Székelys, the Hungarians of Eastern Transylvania.
The other group of Volgan Bulgarians who joined them were the Bersils (Barsils).
In the 820-830's the Kabars (rebels), who rebelled against the Khazar Kaganate and suffered a defeat later, escaped to the Hungarians as well.
According to the traditions of nomadic peoples, they were supposedly employed as subsidiary military people.
Around 850, however, a large number of people may have left the Hungarians of the Don region: after they (in alliance with the Khazars) had suffered a defeat from the Petchenegs, according to Byzantine emperor, Constantin, some of them settled down on the Persian border, south of the Caucasus.
Also known from the messages of the Byzantine emperor, these people exchanged envoys with the Hungarian tribes that moved to the Carpathian Basin after more than a hundred years (around 950).
Riding nomadism - that had been developed on the huge steppe of Eurasia - meant making economic use of the dry steppe under extreme climatic conditions. The shepherds did not graze the animals on territories near their settlements, but each season they drove them to pastures where opulent vegetation was found.
The two basic forms of nomadic grazing were: altering grazing grounds in plains and mountains, and along rivers in north-south direction.
In spring the nomads went further to the north from their winter dwelling-place, or visited pastures that lay high in the mountains.
They always spent the summer in different areas, and with the approach of autumn they left for their permanent dwelling-place.
Their winter homes were usually in the mouths of rivers, in valleys offering protection from the strong winds, and where the snow was not too deep, so that the animals could scrape food out from under the snow.
A supplementary branch of production was farming in the surroundings of their winter homes; the crops sown in spring were harvested at the end of the summer. Besides these, they were also engaged in fishing and hunting.
The basis of farming and their supplementary bartering was first of all the quantity and condition of their live-stock.
The fate of their herds determined their fate - whether they were impoverished or grew rich.
Concerning farming, neither in West-Siberia, nor in Magna Hungaria were the ancient Hungarians so defenceless against the geographical and weather conditions of the open, dry steppe as they were here.
In their former dwelling places, they lived in the grovy zone of the steppe; farming - around their permanent homes - had a more important role in their living, so they could stay in their winter accommodation all year long.
At their dwelling-places they erected various buildings.
Nomadic families - starting from the Ugric age - lived in tents covered with felt, from spring to autumn, or they travelled and lived in ox-carts covered with felt.
In the 5th-7th centuries a new kind of round tent, the yurt, began to spread in the steppe. Because it had a screened wooden structure, it was easy to take apart and put together and it was durable and resistant.
In their winter place of living they henceforward built houses half-dug into the ground, where in the beginning open fireplaces, later ovens made of stone or clay served for heating, baking and cooking.
Earthen stew-pots or earthen cauldrons used for cooking in the open fire were widespread at that time, too.
Village settlements from the 8th-9th centuries discovered at the Don region show that after the Hungarians' moved to Levedia, this process of settling down may have continued: the majority of Bulgarian-Turk loan-words in the Hungarian language are related to farming: words for wheat, barley, plough, sickle, fruit, apple, wine, hemp and pea.
Animal husbandry became intensive: ox, bull, sty, sheepfold.
The words meaning hen and pig are the proofs of it, since pigs and chickens could not bear the continuous moving of the nomads.
The Hungarians in Etelköz were not just nomadic shepherds. There was also a significant farming layer.
Farmers could bring their experience with them to the Carpathian Basin, the westernmost corner of the steppe.
From the 850s the Hungarian tribal alliance - which possessed a big armed force (20.000 horsemen) - lived between the river Dneper and the Eastern Carpathians.
It was governed by a double principality - after Khazar patterns - since moving to Levedia.
During their plunderings, the horsemen could explore the plains of the lowlands and spy upon the power relations in the Carpathian Basin.
Events before the Hungarian Conquest - the settling down in the Carpathian Basin - took place as usual in the steppe: depending on the temporary military balance of forces.
In 894, the Byzantine emperor, Leo the Wise, entered into alliance with the Hungarian principals against the Bulgarian Khan, Simeon, who had previously defeated him in Macedonia.
The Hungarian army was led by Levente, Árpád's son; the army was delivered to the southern bank of the Danube by the Byzantine fleet.
Having defeated Simeon's troops, the army ravaged the territories surrounding the Danubian-Bulgarian capital, Pliszka and Madara.
In the very same year (894), the Moravian prince, Svatopluc asked for their help against the Francs.
The memory of this ally might have been the White-horse legend, according to which Árpád sent a harnessed steed to Svatopluc in exchange for soil, water and grass (in exchange for the three most important elements that guaranteed the sustenance of the equestrian nomadic people).
Meanwhile the Hungarian troops defeated the Francs, and presumably moved to the Upper-Tisza region to wait for the arrival of the main Hungarian army led by Árpád.
The Petchenegs, living between the Volga and Ural rivers, forced the Hungarian tribal alliance to make a major decision: whether they should give up their quarters in Etelköz and take over the new territory, well-protected by mountains.
The Petchenegs, being at constant war with the Khazars, suffered a serious attack around 893-894.
In the meantime, the Bulgarians, who made peace with the Byzantine emperor, concluded an alliance with the Petchenegs and flanked the Hungarians staying in Etelköz.
Since the main forces left, rear-guards were not able to cope with the numerical superiority, and suffered a heavy defeat, losing the majority of their animals. They might have escaped to Transylvania, the trans-Tisza regions and the Great Plain through the mountain passes of the Carpathians.
THE AGE OF THE HUNGARIAN CONQUEST
The Structure of Society
With the conquest of the Carpathian Basin the Hungarian people had new neighbours - people living in states - and their ties with the world of steppe was loosened, though they were an integral part of it before the Conquest.
The Hungarians, with the subsidiary military forces who joined them, took possession of their present home between 895 - 900.
At that time they were living within the bounds of a tribal alliance, but under a unified leadership.
In the sources, the expression "hétmagyar" (the seven Hungarians) refers to the Hungarian nation coming to existence from the alliance of the seven tribes.
In fact, however, their number must have been at least ten, including the three tribes of the "Kabars".
The alliance had two commanders - after the pattern of the Khazar Kaganate.
The supreme command was exercised by the "kende" or "kündü", and the other commander, the "gyula", was in charge of military campaigns, the other main concern of governing.
This political structure is called double principality.
In the 10th century the sources mention a third principal: the "karcha" (horka), which functioned as a judge, and this title was worn hereditarily by the head of one of the tribes.
The chieftains belonged under his comand.
The population of the age of the Conquest contained the following main groups:
- noblemen: leading families with great wealth
- the middle layer: the serving noblemen, more or less wealthy
- common people: who lived in their own communities, partly sharing common property
- servants: people owned by noblemen, living in the vicinity of their lords
These social layers were connected to one another by a complicated system of rights and obligations.
At this time the group of noblemen was called "bõ" (which means plentiful, rich), indicating their political power and economic wealth.
In the relationships of chieftains and heads of clans, marriage played a very important role, assuring one another peace and alliance.
The protection of noblemen, chieftains, and heads of clans was provided by the armed escort formed of the middle layer.
The members of this escort volunteered for this service. They made an oath to their lords, in exchange for which the lord protected them, providing them with board and accommodation.
The common people supported the noblemen. They owed them products as well as their labour.
Communities may have been based on ties of blood, even at this time, which meant shared property, and it also determined their work and economic activities.
They also received foreigners into their communities on many occasions.
The leader of a village was the villicus, who directed the life of the community with the help of the seniors.
The different servants formed a very important group in the society. They settled down near the courtyards of the noblemen, and they formed village communities on the basis of their trades.
Rates were imposed on their products, and they owed certain labour services to their lords (for instance, locksmiths, armourers, gunsmiths, potters, tanners, turners, saddlers, goldsmiths).
The free men were legally equal in the 11th century, but economically there were huge differences among them.
The impoverished layers gradually became dependent on the leaders. By losing their freedom and equality, many of them fell into the group of servants (servus).
The majority of the conquered ethnic groups in the Carpathian Basin, as well as the captives taken during the raids, may have belonged to this very same group.
The leading role of the central power, which was based on personal bonds, could be felt more and more, and the conditions for forming a western-type state - which is based on stable institutions and comprises the whole region of the country - had been developed by the end of the 10th century.
Settling down, raids
In the first phase of the Conquest the Hungarians pressed forward as far as the Danube-Garam line, which was a natural border for them.
In the west, their strong neighbours, the eastern Franks and the Moravians blocked any further expansion.
They took over Transdanubia five years later (900).
Some events made occupying Pannonia easier.
After Svatopluc's death (894), his two sons' fight for the throne weakened the Moravian state, and in addition to this, Arnulf, king of the eastern Franks, formed an alliance with the Hungarians against Berengar, emperor of Lombardy, whom they defeated later.
After Arnulf's death the Hungarians, returning to Pannonia, came to the conclusion that the time was ripe for expanding their territories.
First the Hungarian conquerors occupied the plains, and they gradually expanded their settlements to the mountains.
Their choice was determined first of all by considerations of defence.
They tried to settle down near water, in river valleys and regions protected by marshes.
According to late chronicles, the quarters of principals were situated in the middle reach of the river Danube - the Csepel island was Árpád's center, and Óbuda belonged to Kurszán.
However, the most important contemporary findings testify that after the Conquest, the principals' quarters must have lain exclusively in the Upper-Tisza region.
Planned settlement, the defence of borders, and the borderland (gyepü) served a defensive role.
After the Conquest the defence zone and the borderland protected the country principally from attacks from the east and the south.
To the west, the Hungarians launched attacks or plundering campaigns - frequently in alliance with a western emperor.
Above all, these campaigns determined the Hungarian foreign policy in the 10th century.
More recently the raids are considered as plundering campaigns. This way the Hungarians could obtain luxury items, valuable and expensive goods (including captives) from foreign countries in the form of fights, robbery, booty and tax which their own society could not or could only partly produce.
Only those tribes launched raids that lived near the southern and western borders.
Western European armies then consisted of heavily armoured cavalry.
By contrast, the Hungarians were quick and mobile, and this provided the reason for their success for a very long time.
With their well proven tactics, they tried to flank the armoured cavalry from each side and shoot arrows at them. Then they pretended to run away and finally entrapped the enemy.
During their raids they held the rich, civilized and developed regions of Europe to ransom.
They were at war with Europe for more than 75 years.
Many factors supported the Hungarians in their successes: the above mentioned surprise attacks on horseback, the feudal anarchies that weakened the countries from inside, and the permanent wars that divided Europe.
However, sooner or later, real power relations made Hungarian strategies fail.
It was only a matter of time before European countries could act concertedly against them.
The raids had a contradictory influence on the structure of society. They contributed to the further differentiation of the Hungarian people.
The leading layer of society became richer and richer. First they obtained silver, fabrics and animals as booty during the raids, but later they taxed on defeated rulers - and this strengthened their power.
They left for Germany against king Henry in 933 so as to collect taxes, but he was prepared for the attacks of the Hungarians, and they suffered a defeat at Merseburg.
The battle of Merseburg did not mean the end of the raids, but it undermined the faith that the Hungarians are indefeasible.
Catastrophe reached them at Augsburg in 955.
After a three-day-long bloody fight the Bavarian prince, Henry, had 3 leaders of the captured Hungarians hanged (Bulcsú, Lél, Súr). This had a great psychological effect, since the Hungarians believed that executed leaders became servants of the German, in heaven and their ghosts helped them (the German).
Their defeat brought about great changes in Hungarian foreign policy.
The tribal leaders "replaced" Fajsz with Taksony, to take the lead of the tribal alliance. He made a radical change in Hungarian foreign policy and its direction.
He put an end to the plundering campaigns, and he chose defence instead of attacks.
He strengthened the western border zones, and invited Petcheneg soldiers into the country.
Hungarian-German relations still remained tense.
Taksony, sometimes taking even territorial losses (e.g.: giving up Northern Moravia), attempted to avoid war and maintain peace with the west.
In the south the situation was different.
During the next 15 years they continued the attacks southwards, into Italy, Bulgaria and Byzantium.
The Byzantine emperor, learning about the defeat at Augsburg, stopped paying taxes, and the Hungarians then sent troops against Byzantium under the command of Apor.
Tradition preserved and embellished the story of the brave warrior, Botond, in connection with this campaign, who flew into a rage that the emperor had refused to negotiate with them and broke the Byzantine gates. In contemporary diplomacy, this was a sign of declaration of war.
The last southern, anti-Byzantine campaign of the Hungarians took place in 970, in alliance with the Russians, Bulgarians and Petchenegs.
These allied forces "crossed the Balkan mountains, and after they had set up a camp near the walls of Arkadiupolis waiting for the battle, they burnt and plundered the entire Thracian empire..."
The Byzantine army annihilated the strength of the Petcheneg troops first, and after a long-lasting fight, the Hungarians were finally defeated.
The Hungarian raids ended with the defeat at Arkadiupolis.
Chief-prince Géza realized that warfare should cease, otherwise the nation would be broken down by powers stronger than Hungary.
Internal problems ought to have been solved from inside.
Formerly noblemen obtained treasure at the cost of other countries, but now they obtained it in their own territories.
For this, however, they needed a new organization: domestic and foreign affairs hastened the formation of the Hungarian state.
THE AGE OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE
Chief prince Géza
In the 970s - as a pressing result of the changed domestic and foreign affairs - chief prince Géza adopted Christianity, the faith of the victors, and started spreading it in the country.
At the same time he started to organize the central power, too.
He hardly ever made war against foreign countries during his 25-year-long principality.
His peace policy was reinforced by dynastic marriages - which were quite natural at that time - between his children and members of foreign ruling families.
His eldest daughter became wife of the Polish prince, Boleslo the Brave, and his other daughter was married to Gavril Radomir, the Bulgarian heir to the crown.
Settling the relationship with the Germans was an extremely important issue: his son, Vajk, who received the name István after baptism, married Gizella, daughter of Bavarian prince, Henry the Wrangler, and hereby he became the new Bavarian prince, Henry IV's brother-in-law.
His third daughter was married to Otto Orseolo, the Doge of Venice.
He had a peaceful relationship with countries to the east, that is, with the Russian princes of Kiev, the Petchenegs and the Bulgarians. His brother, Mihály, made things smooth for him, since he married a Bulgarian princess.
In connection with the adoption of Christianity, the question of vital importance was whether Hungary should join the western or the eastern Church.
Formerly (around 948) the Hungarian noblemen joined the Byzantine Church.
The decision on the choice was made by current foreign affairs.
The last phase of the Hungarian raids was directed against the southeast, and this alienated Byzantine relations.
It could have been a warning for the Hungarian principality that the Byzantine emperor abolished the political and religious independence of Bulgaria.
When Byzantium and the Holy Roman Empire were direct neighbours of Hungary, orientation to the west seemed a more promising support for chief prince Géza, since Otto I. also realised that embracing the cause of the Hungarians would reinforce his own political influence in the region.
The Holy Roman emperor selected the members of the mission to Hungary with the advice and cooperation of his immediate followers.
He chose Prunwart (later Saint Bruno) from Saint Gallen as the missionary bishop.
So in the autumn of 972 the archbishop of Mainz consecrated friar Bruno as bishop of the Hungarians, who converted many pagans to Christianity.
He was the one who christened chief prince Géza and his family.
Géza got the name István when he was christened.
His wife, Sharolt, was baptised by the Greek bishop Hierotheos in her early childhood.
The Hungarian chief prince needed the political, moral and occasional military help of the German empire because of the Byzantine threat.
Adopting Christianity was both a cultural and a political event for the Hungarians.
During Géza's reign the plundering campaigns came to an end. By the same token the sources of rich booty also ceased.
All the wealth they brought from abroad so far had to be obtained from inner sources.
Only part of the former military groups could save their independence.
From those, who were no longer needed for military purposes, various services were demanded.
In certain territories it became common to collect the obligatory presents and taxes in the form of produce or products.
Thus the villages of servants around the courts started to grow (cooks, goldsmiths and smiths).
Part of the collected products went to foreign markets, while local noblemen brought luxury items - which they plundered formerly - from merchants.
Customs duties (the main source of income of which was the profit of salt-mines and silver-mines) and the income of different ports were the legal due of the principal.
The spreading of new religion with methods not free from violence, and the need to establish a new internal order brought about resistance among the free, and the leaders of tribes and clans did not necessarily follow these trends either.
Chief prince Géza relied first and foremost on the clergymen and German knights in his immediate entourage to carry out his plans.
To realize his strive for centralisation he needed the help of his strong military escort.
He replaced the pagan tribal leaders and heads of clans with Christian German knights, who supported him loyally, and who were likely to get the property of the rebelling leaders.
These knights formed the center of the heavily armed forces.
The Hungarian soldiers were equipped only with light weapons.
Subsidiary troops might have belonged to the military force of the principality, like the Petcheneg soldiers among others.
Géza intended to leave a country to his successors which was independent of all outer powers.
At the same time, the issue of succession to the throne created tension at the court: by ancestral right Koppány should have claimed the throne, but the ruler chose his first-born son to be his successor.
The fight in the chief prince's family started after Géza's death, in 997.
King Stephen's reign
Géza's efforts to establish a stable state power and guarantee the throne for his son were not really successful, because he had to share some of the country with the other members of the principal family.
Prince Koppány also laid his claim for the throne.
In the Hungarian succession the theory of seniority - the right of the oldest living brother - prevailed.
Koppány also laid claim on the principal's widow, Sharolt.
Géza's will, that his first-born son should inherit the throne, contradicted the ancestral right.
Koppány took up arms, and many people joined him in Transdanubia.
The rebels represented the old faith and order, the ancient human rights, tribal independence and the pagan belief.
Together with his warriors, Koppány marched to Veszprém, which was also Sharolt's residence.
István was prepared for the attack, too: before the battle his followers authorised him to be chief prince by girding a sword on him.
With this army - which consisted of Hungarian and foreign troops as well - he left the fortress of Esztergom for Veszprém.
The leaders of István's (Stephen's) guardsmen were Hont and Pázmány, German "principles".
The Swabian guest (hospes), Vecellin took the lead of the army, and he killed Koppány near Veszprém during the battle.
After the victory, István rewarded the knights who supported him, and he had Koppány quartered and hung his bodily remains from four castle gates as a deterrent. The warning sent to the Transdanubian Székesfehérvár, Veszprém, Gyõr and the Transsylvanian (Gyula)Fehérvár was addressed to the whole nation: with this he wanted to threaten those who intended to turn against the new order he represented.
The foreigners who were staying at the court arrived in the country with Gizella, and their role was very important; not only in armed fights, but in other respects as well.
Their activity in the church and politics was of equal importance: the ruler followed their advice in governing the country.
During the organising of the castle districts and counties, the developed western form made its way into public administration.
Centers that guaranteed the king's power had to be established, and these centers were the castles.
The estate and the servants provided the castle.
A huge part of the estate surrounded the castle itself, but further territories could belong to it as well.
The bailiff directed the life of the castle: he was the judge, he collected taxes, he took the lead of the army of the castle.
He was the supervisor of the villeins - the supporting pillar of the new power.
The clerks of the castle administration were chosen from among them, and they formed the bigger part of the army.
The common people of the castle retained their freedom by right, but actually they were chained to the service of the castle forever.
In the first place they were engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, and only some of them were employed in the army.
They paid tax in money and land produce.
The incomes were shared by the ruler and the bailiff (in the proportion of 2/3 - 1/3).
The royal court set out for journeys quite frequently. Then their numerous escort was stationed in the castles and its surrounding villages. The servants of the castle were obliged to supply them.
If they failed to do so, an accommodation-tax (descensus) may have been claimed from them instead.
The bailiff and his men collected road tax at the borders of the county, and bridge tax at the crossing places of rivers.
Outside the castle walls, not very far from the castle there was a fair, a weekly market on a particular day of the week.
In the beginning, this day was Sunday (the Hungarian word for Sunday - vasárnap - means market day).
With the spread of Christianity this day, however, became a holiday - on Sunday working was prohibited, the people in the village went to church, so market days were put off to other days of the week.
Counties consisted of castle districts, and they were in charge of public administration. They did not serve military purposes at first place.
The Hungarian word "megye" (county) is of Slav origin and it means "border".
The borders of the newly arising counties were determined by the castles, the dioceses and tribal territories, which still existed at that time.
In contrast with castle districts, the counties were contiguous estates, and the dependants of royal, ecclesiastical and secular landlords lived within their borders.
The number of counties may have been about 35-45, less than that of the castle districts.
The head of the counties were the county bailiffs, who were appointed by the king.
After Koppány's defeat and the reorganisation of public administration, chief prince István was of the opinion that strengthening his power and becoming king were issues of crucial importance.
In the autumn of 1000 he sent ministers to the Pope to ask for a crown and the royal title.
It was important for him to ask support from the Pope, and not the German ruler, because by doing so he did not become the vassal of the German empire - though in respect of the church he depended on Rome.
Pope Sylvester II - in concert with the German ruler, Otto III - fulfilled István's request.
With the coming of the new millennium - according to different calendars it might have been on 25th December 1000, or 1st January 1001 - István was crowned king, and hereby Hungary joined the Christian community of European peoples.
So the organisation of the church could start in the new kingdom.
At the Easter of 1001 the Pope founded the archbishopric at Esztergom and gave István a free hand to organise bishoprics.
The first archbishop was Randla, followed by Astric, the former bishop of Kalocsa.
King István founded and sponsored ten dioceses.
The church possessed huge estates, these provided the economic background.
Besides, the payment of tithe for the church, the constructions of churches, and church going were regulated by laws.
King István considered his power to be of divine origin; this appears in his certificates and in the preface of his first book of laws.
The king had a number of royal emblems.
The royal coronation cloak - originally designed for a chasuble - is from 1031, and on this we can see the crown, the orb and the spear.
The sword and the sceptre were royal emblems as well, and centuries later the silver cross was also added.
At the time of its foundation, the Hungarian kingdom preserved its freedom and sovereignity.
István strengthened his power by minting money, framing laws and issuing diplomas.
Minting money in Hungary - after German patterns - posed a number of debated questions.
Experts usually attribute two different mints to István.
One of them is the "dénár" (denarius) with the writing "LANCEA REGIS" (the king's spear) and a hand holding a winged spear on its face, and on its back there is a legend "REGIA CIVITAS" (royal town) and a church in the center.
Such coins survived only in a very small number.
The other mint is the "obulus" (half-denarius), with the legend STEPHANUS REX (King Stephen) on its face, and REGIA CIVITAS - referring to Esztergom - on the back.
These coins, however, were found in such a large quantity that we must come to the conclusion that this currency was widespread throughout the country.
It was in circulation in home and foreign trade as well.
The German influence could be noticed also in legislation.
Two law-books are attributed to István. These contain a total of 56 acts.
There are no manuscripts, though, that would contain all of them.
The king's orders were probably collected in these law-books only after his death.
The general view is that the acts of the first book were codified at the beginning of István's reign, and those of the second book were brought into legislation towards the end of his life. There are no relevant dates in them, though.
The codex of Admont from the 12th century divides the laws into two parts: the first one contains the booklet of moral teachings written to his son (Exhortations), the second one contains a set of criminal laws.
Laws were enacted by the body of the king's councillors.
The royal senate (senatus) consisted of the episcopal board and the bailiffs.
Its two leading figures were the archbishop of Esztergom (the head of the episcopal board) and the most respected bailiff, the palatin of Hungary.
They could give advice to the king, but their advice could not restrict the king's will.
Nine diplomas survived under István's name.
The majority of these are forgeries from the 13th-17th centuries, but some of them contain original elements from the 11th century.
All in all, three authentic diplomas can be linked to the age of István (the Letter of Foundation of Pannonhalma, the Letter of Foundation of the bishopric at Pécs and that of the bishopric at Veszprém).
These diplomas were made by a clerk from the chancellery of Otto III., who settled down in Hungary after the German emperor's death on 23rd January 1002.
On the basis of the handwriting we can identify C. Heribert's work, who was the composer of the Letter of Foundation of Pannonhalma, and who left king István's thoughts to the succeeding generations with his specific decorative letters.
With the help of the laws - the most important contemporary group of sources - we can outline the society of István's age, which can be divided into two parts; the basis of differentiation was whether one was free (liber) or a servant (servus).
The legally uniform society of the freemen consisted of further layers.
On top of the hierarchy was the king (rex); surrounded by the aristocracy - ecclesiastical and secular dignitaries.
The groups of the freemen were the following - on the basis of their financial situation-, according to contemporary laws: bailiff (comes), warrior (miles) and common (vulgaris).
The warriors (milites), who composed the middle layer, were on military duty; they possessed private property (houses, lands, servants).
The common people (vulgari) had smaller properties (horses, weapons), they had to pay the chimney tax - the denarius of the free - per family. They could become impoverished easily, losing more and more of their human and political rights, and gradually sinking to the level of the servants.
Servants (servi) did not have personal and political rights (such as free marriages, moving, making wills, carrying arms, participation in public affairs) that could be summarised as public or golden liberty (aurea libertas).
Attacks against the new order
After the coronation, István became king of Hungary, but in reality his power extended only over western and northern Hungary.
In the eastern part of the country significant forces were in opposition to his uniting and centralising policy.
The king made his uncle (on the mother's side), the Transylvanian Gyula, surrender first, in 1003.
Gyula and his people lived according to pagan traditions, he refused to obey, and intended to create a self-supporting, independent principality.
István himself led a campaign against the disloyal Gyula, who - in the end - did not go against his nephew's army, but surrendered.
After depriving him of the title of lord of province - by this he spread his power to Transylvania -, the king set up the Transylvanian episcopacy.
In course of the fights in the organisation of the state István's next enemy was Ajtony, who developed an independent rule in the territory bordered by the rivers Körös, Tisza, Lower-Danube, and the Transsylvanian mountain range.
Although he took up Byzantine Christianity, he lived according to pagan traditions - as many other people did at that time.
He resisted the king, in his own territory he functioned as a sovereign ruler.
The royal army marched against him with the leader, Csanád at around 1008.
They gained a total victory.
In Ajtony's territory county Csanád was organised, and in 1038 the episcopacy of Csanád was set up, the prelate of which was Gerald from Venice.
As a result of a series of military victories, István managed to unite the Carpathian Basin both politically and religiously.
Arranging home affairs required tremendous energy, thus he followed his father's policy concerning foreign affairs.
He entered into alliance with the German empire, Venice and Byzantium.
When battles were unavoidable, he proved to be a successful commander.
In military affairs the Hungarian king was supported by the armies of the castle districts, the armed forces of ecclesiastical and secular dignitaries and the help of some privileged peoples.
King István defeated the Bulgarians in 1015 as an ally of Byzantium.
In 1017 Polish troops arrived in the country to help Gyula, but they were defeated.
The Hungarian ruler made peace with the Polish chief prince in 1018, and after 1019 a good relationship developed between Hungary and the Kievian ruler, Yaroslav the Wise.
As a result, Russian and Varegian warriors came to the court, who were enlisted as the king's guardsmen, the leader of whose was prince Emeric.
After the fall of Bulgaria in 1018, peace was brought to the Balkans.
Thus Hungary had a common border with Byzantium till the end of the 12th century.
After 1018 István, a respected ruler throughout contemporary Europe, opened the Hungarian section of the pilgrims' route to Jerusalem, offering protection to the travellers.
As a result, Hungary could join the economic, political and intellectual circulation between the eastern and western parts of Europe.
As this route excluded Esztergom, István set up a new residence at Székesfehérvár, where he had a huge basilica built.
He destined it for a royal chapel and burial place.
Later the annual law-days were held here, in the royal headquarters, when everyone could appear before the king.
In 1030 the Hungarian kingdom had to face an enormous trial of strength. There was a German attack against the country, led by emperor Konrad, and at the same time the Czechs also launched an attack.
The German emperor wanted to make Hungary its vassal and restore the former borders of the Carolingian Empire.
The German army, however, suffered a defeat.
Famine brought forth by tactics of well-built border zones and burnt land annihilated the armed forces of the enemy and made them turn back.
During the pursuit István took over Vienna, as well.
The peace signed by the Hungarians, Germans and the Czechs in 1031 granted Hungary territorial growth along the Lajta and Morva rivers.
Concerning succession, István believed that the suitability to rule (idoneitas) was the most important factor, as we can read it in his Exhortation.
In connection with succession, he had to cope with a difficult problem in his last years.
He had two sons: Otto, who died very early, so prince Emeric became the successor. He was provided with a good education, his teacher was the learned bishop Gerald (Gellért).
In 1031 the royal family had to face a disaster: prince Emeric died in course of a wild-boars hunt.
After Emeric's death, István had to look for a new successor.
Finally he chose his nephew, Peter of Orseolo, who was born from his sister's marriage to the Venetian Doge, and who had been living in the Hungarian royal court after his father's fall in Italy.
István adopted him as his son.
His decision hurt the sons of his father's brother - Mihály (Michael), Vazul and László (Leslie) Szár, in their hopes for the throne.
In 1032 a murderous attempt was made on the ill king's life.
The plan, however, did not succeed, and a serious punishment was the result.
The king rendered Vazul unable to rule (he had him blinded and poured lead into his ears), and his children - Levente, András and Béla - were exiled from the country.
The successor, Peter of Orseolo had to make an oath, that he would obey István, have a respect for the queen, Gisella, whom he would not molest in property, and whom he should protect from everyone.
Our first king died on the 15th August, 1038.
According to his will, he was buried in the basilica of Székesfehérvár.
He was canonized in 1083, during king Ladislas's reign.
His memory and relics were preserved by the passing centuries.
THE HUNGARIAN LANGUAGE
INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF THE LANGUAGE
The independent history of the Hungarian language began approximately 3000 years ago, when the Hungarian people left their linguistic community (pre-Hungarian age) and continued its life independently.
The history of the Hungarian language consists of different phases: the early Hungarian period: from around 1000 BC till 896 AD, the old Hungarian period: 896 - 1526, the middle Hungarian period: 1526 - 1772, and the modern Hungarian period: from 1772 to the present. These periods are linked to historical events, turning points showing the connections between social and linguistic changes.
(The subject-matter here is related to the period from the linguistically independent pre-Hungarian age to the beginning of the old Hungarian age.)
200 years of research in the field of language history paired with the methods of comparative linguistics have shown that the Hungarian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family. This shows even earlier relations with the Samoyed family of languages.
The Finno-Ugric and Samoyed languages both derive from the so-called Uralian language.
In 4000 BC this linguistic community split into two branches.
The most distant relatives of the Hungarians live in the region of the river Jenisey; and the modern languages of the original Samoyed language family are the Nyenyets, Nganasan, Enyets, and Selcup.
The unity of the Finno-Ugric languages came to an end around 2000 BC, when the two large groups separated as a result of their migrations.
The Finno-Permian branch travelled west, while the community speaking the Ugrian original language stayed on the east side of the Ural mountains.
The unity of the Finno-Permian original language ended around the middle of the second millennium BC. This in turn became the Permian original language (which includes the Zuryen [Komi] and the Votyak [Udmurt] languages) and the Finno- Volgan original language. Modern languages derived from it are Finnish, Estonian, Lappian, Mordvinian, Cheremis [Mari], Karyalan, Inker, Vepse, Votian, and Livian.
The Ugrian original language splintered after 1000 BC.
The Hungarians' closest relatives, who stayed in West Siberia, are the Voguls [Manshi] and the Ostyaks [Hanti], who live alongside the Ob river nowadays.
The Hungarians began their long journey to the west, which is quite difficult to trace.
The home of the Uralian language family (those who spoke a common language) can perhaps be located with the help of linguistic palaeontology.
According to this linguistic approach, the Uralian original home is situated between the Middle and South of the Urals and the lower reach of the river Ob.
The Finno-Ugric original home could have lain west of this region, between the Urals and the Kama river, but there is no real evidence for it at this time.
The loose community at the Urals broke up at around 4000 BC and from that time on we can talk about a Finno-Ugric community.
The period before the history of the independent Hungarian language is called pre-Hungarian period.
The linguistic affinity which ties the Hungarians to the Ugric language family does not mean ethnic relationship or common origin.
THE PRE-HUNGARIAN PERIOD
The language of a nation inevitably shows its culture, education and thinking.
The words of the basic word-stock, which are related to every-day life, have a very important role in our language today.
Hungarian has about 700 words of Finno-Ugric origin.
These ancient words suggest the way of life of the past community.
The Hungarian words for: hunter, bow, arrow, quiver, knife, wild, stalking, hare, fox, weasel, grouse, goose, fish, boat, net, bleak, daughter-in-law, lake and water are of Finno-Ugric origin and demonstrate the importance of hunting and fishing at that time.
Also of Finno-Ugric origin are certain Hungarian words related to women's work: root, bulb, skin/shell, bud, leaf, grass, strawberry, millet, stone, bread, fire, (cooking-)pot, to cook, spit and to bake.
The words for horse, halter, saddle and dog are also from the pre-Hungarian period.
The words for house, threshold, to put and bough perhaps relate to a simple kind of tent, or a hut dug in the ground.
The ancient words connected with dressing are those for leather, to sew, sleeve, breast, belt and ribbon.
Words referring to trades include: awl, wood, to carve, to drill, drill, axe, to sharpen, twig and to weave.
Defining relationships between family members could have been very important: father, mother, daughter-in-law, son, daughter, husband and woman.
The words for numbers give an indication of Hungarian education; from 1 to 6 they are of Finno-Ugric origin, but these people might have had words for the decimal or even the centesimal numerical system.
That they had knowledge of ordinal numbers is shown in the words for first and second.
The verb "read" meant "count".
The Hungarian words for left and right refer to orientation in space, while the words for year, month, and autumn, winter and spring refer to orientation in time.
The phenomena of nature were named too: sky, heaven, star, night, dawn, ice, freeze, lake, foam, mountain, peak, road, to glow, dark, fire and hill.
Some words referring to the parts of body are also from the original language: head, hair, forehead, eye, ear, throat, mouth, tongue, tooth, chin, shoulder, finger, breast, bile, liver, hand, elbow, skin, vein and blood.
Hungarian has verbs from this period which define basic actions: stand, come, go, sleep, swim, eat, drink, live, die, exist, wish, push, cut, slice, chase, play and laugh.
Hungarian pronouns of Finno-Ugric origin include I, you, he/she/it, we, you, what, this and that.
Let us finish our discussion of vocabulary with the word the Hungarians used for naming themselves, the word "magyar".
The name of the Hungarian people is an obscure compound noun. Its first part is of Finno-Ugric or Ugric origin, which might have meant "man".
The origin of its second part is debated.
If it originates from one of the Turkic languages, it means man (-eri), if it is Finno-Ugric, it might be identical with the second part of the word man (Finnish yrkö - man, Cheremis erghe - boy).
The grammatical system may have been very simple.
The possessive personal suffixes, which were formed from the personal pronouns, are of Finno-Ugric origin.
Parts of the conjugation of verbs came from the original language.
The formation of modality (of verbs) also started in this period.
In all probability there was no suffix for the accusative ending, and adverbs without suffix might have been used frequently.
Circumscriptions and adverbs could have been used for specifying places.
The role of Hungarian formative syllables was even more obscure. They may have several different roles, and their usage was occasional.
The adjective stood before the qualified word without agreement.
Singular verbs were used after cardinal numbers.
Subject and predicate did not yet agree in number.
The inflection of nouns may have had singular forms.
The predicate of a sentence could be a noun, a verb or a participle.
The phonetic structure of the language may have been very primitive, too. Due to the lack of data we can only make deductions concerning its elements.
It seems certain that vowels could alternate with one another.
The original language made use of vowel-harmony, so that one word had either front or back vowels only.
The stress probably fell onto the first syllable.
Words, formative syllables, and suffixes ended with a vowel.
THE EARLY HUNGARIAN PERIOD
It starts with the separation from the Ugric language community, which happened around 1000 BC upto the conquest of the Carpathian Basin.
Unfortunately we have no linguistic records from this age.
During their migrations, the Hungarian people may have enriched the word-stock and grammatical system they inherited from the time of the Finno-Ugric period.
This development was encouraged by the changing environment and the influence of the neighbouring peoples.
These cultural influences can be followed in the enrichment of the word-stock, which changed in the most flexible way.
The numerous loan-words show the intensive connection with the neighbours.
The number of old Turkish loan-words is about 300, but primarily their nature, rather than their quantity, shows what a large cultural impact they had on the Hungarians' education.
Compared with former ages, these were words suggesting a radically new way of life.
Words from old Turkic languages were added to the word-stock of animal husbandry, such as: bull, ox, calf, goat, ram, cheese, cottage cheese, wool, hobble, rein, sheepfold, pigsty, pig, hen, camel.
The Hungarians received some expressions connected to agriculture from old Turkish languages: barley, wheat, sickle, plough, stubble, to grind, fruit, apple, pear, nut, hop, grapes, wine, pea.
Hungarian words referring to trades are: carpenter, furrier, grocer; words in connection with dressing are: gown, velvet, buckle, bead, ring, to suit, mirror.
Loan-words in the field of social and religious life are: law, interpreter, witness, peace, wages, loan, mourning, witch, dragon, to enchant and to charm.
Among the Hungarian words for body parts arm, knee, ankle, beard, freckle are of old Turkish origin together with some words indicating qualities: small, tiny, weak, old, blue, yellow, brave and coward.
These words refer to the natural environment, fauna and flora: lion, badger, hawk, vulture, turul, falcon, dogberry, blackthorn, hornbeam, ash, weed, matgrass, stinging-nettle and hemp.
The Hungarians' ancestors were not neighbours with the Persians, but they had business contacts, which is proved by the Hungarian words for customs and fair. They also traded with the Alans of Iran, which is shown by the Hungarian words for bridge and glass.
Other Iranian Alan loan-words are the Hungarian equivalents for harness, sword, woman, (reigning princess), rich, cow, milk, butter (grease), felt and ten.
Loan-words in Hungarian give evidence that the Hungarian people had contact with Slavic nations, Slavic languages before the Conquest.
Loan-words from those days are: Duna (Danube), Greek, Polish, farm and vaivode.
The Hungarian word-stock was increased by means of derivation and compound words.
The former was helped by the newly arising system of formative syllables.
At this time the Hungarian words for god, principal, source and power were created by derivation.
The Hungarian phonetic structure has undergone a large change: it became richer, and it seems closer to the present-day consonant system of the Hungarian language.
The mixed vowel sound system came into being.
The grammatical system starts to show the bases of our present-day grammar, its characteristic features take shape, based on the Finno-Ugric heritage.
THE OLD HUNGARIAN PERIOD
The old Hungarian period of the history of the Hungarian language begins with the conquest of the Carpathian Basin and ends in 1526.
Since linguistic processes take a long time, - and our present research finishes with the beginning of this period -, we can only touch upon the trends of this development.
But we must not forget that even if we take the most flexibly changing word-stock, we cannot narrow down the date of the changes to within a few decades, so in many cases it is inevitable not to refer to the linguistic phenomena characteristic of the period after the foundation of the state.
After the conquest the Hungarian people led a semi-nomadic, that is, a rigorous pastoral and agricultural lifestyle parallel to the spread of a new culture.
The impact of Byzantine and western Christianity, the animal husbandry and agriculture of the local inhabitants set off a significant intellectual and material development in education in the history of the Hungarian people beginning in the 11th century.
Linguistically it appeared first in the word-stock of the Hungarian language.
The vocabulary of the settled Hungarians was influenced mostly by the Slavic, the German and the Latin language.
Later on Italian and French influence can be perceived.
Expressions linked to agriculture and animal husbandry were borrowed mainly from Slavic languages: grain, rye, straw, harrow, scythe, bean, peach, carrot, sheep, ewe, rooster, pigeon, yoke, oxbow, hay and shepherd.
Nouns in Hungarian that are attached to trades like cooper, smith, weaver, miller and dammer are of Slavic origin.
Words referring to the house were adopted from the local Slavic: kitchen, cellar, window, key, bench, table and lunch.
There are many Slav loan-words in the word-stock of the church and of the state: cross, Christian, friar, nun, saint, miracle, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Christmas, emperor, king, to order and work.
From the German language the Hungarians borrowed expressions referring to court and army life: prince, count, fur, armour, visor, lance, siege, fireplace, lute.
The Latin language played an important role in the development of Hungarian literacy, concerning both the style and the representation of writing.
They adopted words and expressions referring to religion, the church, and of the state from the Latin: school, cloister, pope, angel, satan, parson, apostle, crown, register.
On the basis of phonetic comparison we know that at the end of the early Hungarian period the number of consonants increased, developing from Finno-Ugric phonemes and phoneme linkages.
The phonemes of loan-words were adjusted to the Hungarian phonetic structure.
Consonants at the beginning of the old Hungarian period are closer to the present-day consonants in the language.
The old Hungarian period is a period with literary remains in the history of the language, though there was no real Hungarian literacy at that time - however the Hungarians' ancestors may have recorded shorter or longer texts with the help of runic writing.
Hungarian literary remains are sporadically preserved in Greek or Latin texts, and original texts have survived from the end of the 12th century.
LITERATURE
THE REMAINS OF ORAL TRADITION
The Hungarian ancient poetry is shrouded in the mists of the past.
We know of no literary remains from this period.
It was only later Latin texts which preserved some information for us.
And there are some scraps and motifs of the Hungarian pagan poetry preserved on the lips of people.
The ancient poetry had oral traditions, the professional cultivators of poetry were the pagan priests, the shamans.
The deeds of heroes were sung by the minstrels, who composed and performed their songs themselves.
After adopting Christianity the sources called them joculators, that is minstrels.
Their role was very important, since they preserved the ancient Hungarian epic tradition for centuries.
They were in the service of the king and the noblemen.
In their works, the learned chroniclers made use of many of their songs.
The ancestors of the Hungarians must have known the ancient genres of lyrics and epics.
The ancient types of lyrics might have been ritual songs and working songs.
The text of these may have been built - on the basis of a certain content-structure scheme, but freely - on improvisation.
Fixed motifs could have been the onomatopoetic refrains, which might have strengthened the rhythm.
We can read about working songs in the Saint Gerald legend.
We can read about the existence of shaman songs in the chronicles.
During the 1061 pagan riot the people's magicians shouted sacrilegious poems and practised magic.
The oldest lyric genre is the dirge, which in its development probably reaches back to the Ob-Ugric times.
Wailing over the dead helps the peace of the journey after death, thus ensuring the peace of the living.
The song focuses on the bewailed person. It calls the world of the dead and the connection of the living with the dead.
From comparative folklore, it is possible that the ancient genres of epics were short prosaic works, tales, and legends.
The origin of tales dates back to the unknown past.
Its oldest layer is from an early period of mankind, it can be found in every nation, its elements simultaneously showing traces of primitive religion and primitive epics.
Typical motifs are: the man is equal with his name and clothes. A part represents the whole (for example, instead of the persecuted, a hair, a drop of blood answers the persecutor - animism); whereas in other cases the whole world is considered a unified soul - trees, plants, objects have souls and minds.
The hero of Hungarian tales is frequently the youngest son.
This motif of the tale preserved an ancient customary law.
The special right of the youngest son is to inherit the father's house. He chooses first from the distributed riches.
The hero of the tale is helped by the magic steed, who can speak and fly, too, and has supernatural power.
The horse is the favourite animal of the ancestors of the Hungarians. They sacrificed white horses to their gods.
The milk of the mare has magic power, it protects from sorcery.
Among the Hungarians' relatives in the east people sprinkle the dead with mare's milk as a protection against spoiling.
The fight of magic steeds has a very important role in the tales and beliefs of the Hungarians. It preserves the traces of shamanism from the age of the Conquest.
In Hungarian tales we can find the concept of a threefold partition of the world, which is an ancient motif, which can also be connected to the shamanism of the Ural-Altaic people.
According to this, the sky is an enormous tent held up by a column, a world tree, a sky-high tree.
On this world tree one can reach the upper world, as heroes and mythical figures can in the tales.
In reality - according to their beliefs - the shaman made this symbolic journey.
During the ritual he fell into a trance, while alone.
He reached the uppermost regions, where he could contact the gods.
Thus the world is multi-layered.
According to the tales, upwards there is a heavenly door, downwards there is a hole to cross.
Up there, there are gods and fairies, down there, there are dragons and devils.
The world is bordered by crystal mountains, on the other side of which lies the other world.
The typical mythical figure of tales and legends is the dragon.
It can be found in the myths of different people, it is a malevolent demon appearing in various forms.
It either lives in the upper world or down there in the nether world, it can have one or more heads, and it can appear in the form of a snake or a human.
The characteristic feature of the genre of legend is that it mixes reality with mythical elements.
Traces of legends are preserved in Latin chronicles from the Middle Ages.
A work by Anonymus, entitled Gesta Hungarorum gives evidence that heroic deeds lived on the lips of people in the 12th century, and that minstrels also served as transmitters of traditions.
The Hungarian people's legend of origin, the legend of the mythical hind is known from Simon Kézai's work and the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle).
The oldest layer of the legend is the motif of a stag chase.
We can find the stag chase as a myth of origin in the Ugric age already, and it can also be found in Vogul, Ostyak, and Persian traditions.
While chasing a hind, the sons of Eneh, Hunor and Magor, reach the Meotis region, which they find suitable for settlement (this region is on the northern coast of the Black Sea).
The name Eneh means hind.
The ancestors of the people are believed to originate from her (the hind's) and a stag's predatory nuptials.
Hunor and Magor are the representatives of Onogur and Magyar (Hungarian) people's name.
Thus the totemistic ancestress of the Hungarian people is the hind.
The other part of the legend is the motif of the abduction of women.
The two heroes and their warriors got their wives by abducting the daughters of the Bulgarian prince, Belar.
This defines the time of origin of the story, since the Hungarians lived together with the Bulgarians and Iranian Alans on the South-Russian steppes in the centuries before the Conquest.
We can read the Álmos legend in Anonymus's works and in the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle). This legend is also called "Emese's Dream" and it is the legend of origin of the Árpád clan.
It tells the story how Álmos was born. He was the son of Ügyek and Emese.
Emese had a dream, in which she saw a "turul bird" (the legendary bird of the Hungarians), which flew onto her, making her pregnant. This bird predicted a successful future for the clan.
The Hungarian name Emese means sow, consequently we can see the elements of a totemistic wedding (of her and the bird) in this legend.
The Hungarians' most safely-preserved historic legend which remained perfectly preserved regarding its structure is the White Horse legend, which survived in the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle).
In accordance with nomadic poetic traditions it explains the Conquest with a symbolic buying and selling, thus proving the lawfulness of Árpád's conquests.
The Slav prince, Svatopluc believed that the white horse and harness sent him by the Hungarians as a present verified his own power.
However, the Hungarians considered the grass, water, and soil, requested and received from Svatopluc as a symbol of surrender.
There are many heroic legends about the plundering raids, which describe the battle of nations as a fight between persons.
Simon Kézai wrote down two legends in his chronicle between 1210 and 1280. According to the first one commander Lehel was captured after the defeat in the battle at Augsburg (955). Before his execution he cried "You are ahead of me and you will be my servant in heaven!" and he would strike the German emperor dead with his horn, but it was only a myth in the memory of people who wanted to embellish their heavy defeat.
The Botond legend is also mentioned by Anonymus in his chronicle.
Hungarians on horseback marching against Byzantium finally arrived in Constantinople where Botond broke the golden gates of the capital with his battle-axe.
Breaking the city gates was the contemporary traditional symbol of declaring war, after which the small Hungarian warrior showed his enormous strength: he fought with a Greek giant and defeated him.
THE BEGINNING OF LITERACY
In Hungarian literature, literacy starts with the adoption of Christianity.
It did not mean Hungarian literacy, it was actually Latin.
The influence of Latin literature and writing on the subsequent development of Hungarian literacy was very important in respect of contents, form, and genre.
The Hungarians encountered Christianity through the Byzantine empire.
The first Hungarian episcopacy was founded according to orthodox Greek traditions, many dignitaries were baptized in accordance with Greek rituals.
Géza, however, turned both to the Greek and the Roman Catholic church at the same time.
The Benedictine order had the most important role in organising the church and evangelisation.
The first monastic community was established around 996 on mount St. Martin, later called Pannonhalma, which was followed by a number of other monasteries.
During the reign of St. Stephen the structural frames of the development of medieval culture were taking shape, and in the 11th century forms of ecclesiastic art are coming into existence.
Literate people came from the leading layer of the church.
Priests from the lower clergy could only read at the very most.
Writing was slow, clumsy work, and they wrote on expensive parchment, so handwritten books, the codices, were of great value.
A copyist's work was highly respected.
A monastery had a library and usually a scriptorium (a room where books were copied).
At its inception, Hungarian Latin literature tried to meet the demands of the state and the church.
Its bigger part disappeared without trace, so we can only assume its existence.
Through organising the state, legal and political literature comes into existence: diplomas and letters, acts and royal mirrors.
Diplomas were written after Byzantine and western models.
The first preserved remain - in a copy - is from 1002, a Letter of Foundation from Pannonhalma, which was given to St. Martin monastery by king St. Stephen.
The letter - like the diploma - had to meet set formal requirements.
It could have legal functions, too.
Letters had an important role in the forming of the standard style.
Acts start with the two books of St. Stephen's decrees.
The first book - at the beginning of his reign - contained criminal laws protecting private property (it appeared around 1001).
The second book consisted of his orders referring to the church (written between 1030-1038).
Its oldest form, which survived in a manuscript, was preserved in the codex of Admont from the 12th century, and contained St. Stephen's laws exclusively.
The most important remain of early Hungarian literature is entitled "King St. Stephen's exhortations to his son, prince Emeric (Imre)", a work on state affairs.
A popular genre in the early Middle Ages was the royal mirror, which explains the science of governing and reigning in the form of moral exhortations.
Following antique traditions, it is published as the highly respected ruler's own beliefs and teachings.
The year of prince Emeric's death ascertains the time of its origin, so it must have been written before 1030, probably in the first half of the 1010s.
The writer of the "Exhortations" was a foreign learned clergyman, who adjusted the traditional features of the genre to the unique Hungarian conditions.
He describes the duty of the ruler in ten chapters, half of which is about the duties toward the Christian faith and the church, and about practising religious virtues.
The other part of the work relates to the governing of the state.
The legend, an important genre of the Hungarian Latin literature came into being in the second half of the 11th century.
There were several legends about figures from the St. Stephen era, that were written on the occasion of the preparatory works on his canonization or after that.
The writer of the first legend originating from Hungary was Mór, a bishop from Pécs.
It concerns the lives of Zoerard-Andrew and Benedict, and was written shortly after 1064.
The figure of Mór appears in the St. Emeric legend, as well.
He is the one who was rewarded with seven kisses from St. Emeric for his religious zeal during his priesthood at Pannonhalma.
Mór was one of the prelates descended from Hungary.
In the legend he describes the ascetic life of two hermits, shortly and briefly, with simple words and in an unbiased tone.
St. Stephen's great legend was written between 1077 and 1083 by an unknown Benedictine monk.
The country is called Regnum Marianum (Mary's country) first here, suggesting that Hungary kept a distance from the papacy, as in heavenly hierarchy Mary is located higher than St. Peter, consequently Hungary cannot be part of "terra sancti Petri" (St. Peter's land).
St. Stephen's small legend came into being under the rule of king Coloman (1095-1116): it underlines Stephen's royal firmness and grammatical education - projecting his successor's, Coloman's virtues onto him.
The motif of the crown sent by the Pope appears first in the third St. Stephen legend, written by bishop Hartvic, which he considers as God's will, stressing the independence from the Pope.
The original text of bishop St. Gerald's great legend is from the 11-12th century, but all we know is an enlarged transcript from the 14th century.
Its unknown author converts the bishop's life into a colourful story. It is almost a short story.
We can find some features in it that remind us of folk tales.
It is the most outstanding piece of literature from the age of Árpád.
The other legend about him, (St. Gerald's small legend) might have been written for preaching purposes in the second half of the 12th century.
St. Emeric's legend was written after 1083, after his canonization.
The prince believed that the main virtue was chastity, setting a good example for the clergymen in the age of definitions.
Historiography started with the organisation of ecclesiastical institutions. At first they took short notes.
According to the literary remains which survived, annales (annuals/year-books) were written beginning with 997, on mount St. Martin (Pannonhalma).
We know this from the Annual of Pozsony, where the date of bishop St. Gerald's consecration (1030) is also mentioned.
In the 11th century the genre of chronicle came into vogue in Hungary.
Anonymus's (magister P.) work called Gesta Hungarorum describes the past of the noble Hungarian people from the original home till the age of raids, focusing on the story of the Conquest and the founding of the state.
His adventurous "gesta" is considered to be a literary work of art rather than a historic work.
Simon Kézai, king Ladislas IV's court priest, wrote his chronicle around 1283.
His sources were earlier chronicles relating to Hungarian history, and other Italian, French, and German historic works.
He examined the ancient history of the Hungarian people, and the idea of the Hun-Hungarian kinship plays an important role in it.
The Hungarians' most precious literary remain from the age of Árpád, the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle) survived from the 1360s.
Its significance lies in the fact that it is a summary of works describing the history of the Hungarians, from the 11-14th centuries, so it is a basic source for the researchers of early Hungarian history.
ARTS
FINE ARTS
Art in the age of the conquest
Hungarian art is coloured by its multi-rooted origin: the influence of living together with Finno-Ugric peoples can be detected in existing folk art and folk traditions, in mythology - which preserves fragmentary memories of the past - and folk music.
On the basis of contemporary burial traditions and archaeological findings, we could equally find dissimilar features among the memories of the ancient Hungarians. At the time of the conquest of the Carpathian Basin and the founding of the state, the population - being essentially Finno-Ugric in its language - had several features in its education, its social and military structure that were characteristic of the steppe.
The archaeological findings from the 10th century are, of course, rather scant. The majority of organic materials decayed in the soil, so apart from pottery and animal bones, mostly only metal objects survived.
The most frequent archaeological findings are objects of everyday use: decorations for clothes, weapons, jewellery and relics of food and drink sacrifices (pots and animal bones).
It was characteristic of the burial traditions of the stock-breeding Hungarians to sacrifice one of the horses that belonged to the deceased person.
The meat of his favourite animal was eaten during the funeral feast, its skin, skull and shin bones were put in the grave, alongside the corpse.
The nomad world and way of life is reflected by men's saddle-horses and richly harnessed steeds, pointing to the one-time rank and social status of its owner.
One of the characteristic features of Hungarian art is the palmette motif (leaf and branch) on pouch-plates.
The pouch hanged from the right side of a man's belt and it usually contained tools for making fire (striker, flint and tinder).
The metal plates were embossed from the back and patterned with a chisel (and punch) on its face; the surface of the background was often covered with the so-called fire-gilding (fine gold powder was melted on top).
The main motif on pouch-plates - just as on clothes, sabres, cap ornaments or belt-mounts - was the palmette.
On women's clothing and other findings the representations of animal shapes are more common, appearing on different braid-discs, bracelets and even on harness-mounts.
Besides the usual floral motifs, animal-shapes can hardly ever be found on relics connected to men (strap-ends, snaffle sticks, disc ornaments and principal sabres).
One of the best-known findings is the animal-shape motif on the pouch-plate from Bezdéd: a griffin with a dog head and the tail feathers of a peacock (senmurv) and a one-horned, winged animal - the figures of Iranian mythology - surround the Byzantine cross.
It is a proof of contemporary syncretic beliefs.
Turuls (eagle or hawk-like bird of prey), or stags appear most frequently on relics.
They - like palmette - might be of Iranian origin.
The embossing of motifs on pouch-plates has similarities with leather work.
The representation of light and shadow might refer to textile precedents.
The rich women's clothing at the age of the conquest included gold-plated silver braid discs, hangers, shirt-collar decorations, mounts on decorative kaftan caps and earrings.
These accessories were not only decorations: the animal representations on them might have given protection to its owner, and the tree of life symbolised the living-space of helping spirits.
Gold and silver coins, treasures and jewellery collected in the course of plundering campaigns were soon melted, and goldsmiths made various products from it according to their own system of symbols or the taste of their customers.
To this great splendour, a large quantity of precious metals was required: for example, the average weight of men's belt-mounts showing their ranks and social status was about 200 grams, but some items of women's horse-furnishing might have required about 1.5 kilogram of silver.
Art in St Stephen's age
The founding of the state and the gradual transformation of economy brought slow but drastic changes.
In the second half of the 10th century the Hungarians - having given up pagan traditions - attempted to join the community of Western European feudal states.
The main motif of folk art, the palmette, became fashionable in stone-dressing, too.
One of the oldest indications of this is the appearance of ribbon-braided decorations on the architectural remains of the Zalavár basilica with three naves.
At the same time the use of acantus leaves can be seen.
The preliminary of the Zalavár monastery, founded by king St Stephen in 1019, was a Christian church built in the 9th century, and the town of Pécs was also named after its ancient Christian church (Quinque martyrorum basilicae) in the Middle Ages (Quinque basilicae, Fünfkirchen).
The oldest buildings of the Hungarians were Byzantine-type central churches and the little rotundas of Western-type baptising churches.
Royal chapels, large circular churches and churches with a single nave were transformed into convent churches under the management of the abbacy.
Soon huge cathedrals and magnificent abbeys were built on mount St Martin (today's Pannonhalma), in Bakonybél.
The monumental product of secular architecture was chief prince Géza's palace on the castle-hill of Esztergom.
King Stephen continued his father's building, so Esztergom could become the main ecclesiastical and political centre.
Later Székesfehérvár became the royal residence, where the constructions of a colossal three-nave basilica began around 1018.
The church had a 60-meter long main nave and a double-pillared colonnade.
This church of the Virgin Mary was planned to be the church of the royal family, but eventually it became a secular centre with ecclesiastical privileges.
The royal pulpit stood here, and the crown jewels were also kept here.
According to his own will, Stephen was buried here in 1038: his first resting-place was a white stone coffin, made from a Roman sarcophagus, showing Byzantine elements in its iconography.
The relationship of the donor and the founded institution was very important in this period.
King St Stephen enacted a law, according to which every ten villages had to build a church.
The furnishing of the church was provided by the king, the priests and books were provided by the bishop.
Thus western-type Christianity and art was continuously spreading in the country.
The most important relic of contemporary art is the coronation cloak.
This is the only relic that in all probability belongs to the first royal couple of the Hungarians, St Stephen and Gisela.
It survived in fact, and it was made in 1031 as a chasuble.
The outstanding goldwork of the age is also connected to king Stephen's wife.
It is the so-called Gisela-cross. Its gold plates were decorated with enamel cells, real pearls and precious stone settings.
Its main figure is a golden Christ-figure, with Gisela and her mother, Isabella of Burgund, kneeling at its legs.
The Hungarian queen had it made for her mother's tomb in Niedermünster, Regensburg.
The minor remains of contemporary Christianity come with different bronze crosses.
These relic-holders and crosses worn on the chest are considered as the first real Christian remains from the 10th century.
The hollowed relic-holders from the Holy Land got into the country in large numbers after 1018, when king Stephen opened the Hungarian section of the pilgrimage route to the Holy Land.
On the face of the embossed chest crosses we can usually see a Christ-figure, and on the back Mary or on the sides of the cross the donator is represented praying with raised hands.
So far only objects connected to historical persons have been mentioned, but now at the end of this summary, let's talk about those memories of the history of art that can be connected to one of the outstanding figures of the Hungarians' early history only through legends.
Writing about the 955 Augsburg defeat both Anonymus and Kézai mention Lehel's horn in their chronicles.
This horn might have been the main characteristic of leader Lehel - it must have been his emblem of honour.
In Hungary the legend refers to a Byzantine ivory carving, which is kept in the museum of Jászberény today.
(This work of art is not unique, however, because there are at least 40 such ivory horns among the remains of the early Middle Ages.)
Lehel's horn was carved from a tusk of an elephant around the 9th-10th century.
On the horn is the representation of the opening ceremony of circus games - often organised by Byzantine emperors.
The open palm within a magic symbol in the center may have been the hand of the emperor giving permission to open the games.
Ritual drinking from different horns was an old tradition in the steppe.
These horns were not only musical instruments, but also served as emblems of honour.
The principals of the age of migration had gold horns, the rank of the leaders were shown by silver- or gold-mounted horns.
The miniaturist of the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle) represented the Hungarians' arrival in the Carpathian Basin with a picture where Árpád, in the central scene, is holding a gold-mounted horn in his hand, and he is tasting the water of the Danube. With this, he symbolically takes over the new country.
MUSIC
No written memories of ancient Hungarian music have survived.
To reconstruct the musical traditions of the conquering Hungarians, researchers must compare folk music noted down in the 20th century with the musical remains of people related to the Hungarians.
According to Nestor, the author of ancient Russian chronicles, the songs of the Hungarians entranced Kiev, too, in 885.
Ekkehard - in his chronicle compiled at around 1108 - wrote that the Hungarians had found a simple-minded fellow called Heribald in the deserted monastery of St Gallen.
Having seen his stupidity they mercifully did not kill him. They even had dinner with him.
After drinking an enormous quantity of wine, which they found in the cellar, "they began shouting to their gods in terrible voices".
After this loud revelry, their interpreter, a captive priest, who spoke Hungarian, - together with Heribald - started to sing the antiphony of the Holy Cross (Sanctifica nos - Sanctify us) in a hoarse voice, as it was the feast of the Holy Cross the following day, on 3rd May.
The Hungarians listened to the strange song of the captives in astonishment, until the horns and cries of their watchmen drew their attention to the approaching enemy.
In the description of the 993 Merseburg battle, Liutprand, bishop of Cremona, mentions that the pagan Hungarians hurled themselves on the Germans singing the prayer "Kyrie eleison" (Lord, have mercy on us) with the battle-cry "hui, hui".
Anonymus also wrote about the revels of the Hungarians in his chronicle.
Formerly, in connection with the fights near Kiev, he mentioned the battle horns, too.
The description of pagan revolts after king Stephen's death refers to the ritual-like music of the Hungarians in some way or another: in 1046, János, son of Vata, collected numerous shamans and prophet- priests around himself, who praised their lord with enchanting songs.
In 1060, when the crowd demanded the restoration of pagan religion from king Béla I - who hid behind the walls of the Fehérvár castle, their leaders attacked Christianity with disgraceful carmens (charming songs).
According to researchers, there might have been many style levels in the development of the music of the Hungarians.
The first major period of music comes with the time when they lived together with Ugric peoples; the second one may have developed in course of the centuries of contact with Turkic peoples.
The group of dirges - the oldest layer in Hungarian folk music, presumably from the age when they lived together with Ugric peoples - represent archaic forms, and show a relationship with a certain type of Ostyak songs.
In this type of songs features of ritual and memorial, praising and weeping (for the dead heroes) are still interwoven, although they subsequently become independent genres.
The memorial function continued in epic genres, the praising style lived on in hymnic works, while the role of calling spirits continued in funeral songs.
Soloistic recitative, that is, half-spoken, half-sung presentation is a typical feature of the dirges.
The best-known descendants of mourning-style are the ballad of the big mountain thief, "Rosemary Grown on the Snow-covered Mountain of the Rainbow" and "Pannonia Faces Tremendous Decline".
While dirges can be connected to Ugric influence, the appearance of five-note pentatonic melodies in Hungarian musical traditions can be explained by the centuries-long co-existence with the Turkic peoples.
Musical beauty and the expression of emotions played an important role.
A well-known example is the folk song entitled "The Peacock Has Settled" from the county of Somogy.
Feasts connected to nature can presumably be traced back to the age of the Conquest and the founding of the state. The musical components of these have survived among the people till today.
Minstrel songs are memories of the feast of the winter solstice; the minstrel refrain itself has its equivalent in the refrain formulae of Byzantine rituals.
Midsummer night songs - which are connected to the summer solstice - and the musical elements of other spring folk traditions refer to the reception of the influence of European agricultural states, Byzantium and other Slav peoples.
Originally, minstrels were performers of heroic songs from the pagan age in princes' courts.
Today's folk minstrels are accompanied by loud musical instruments, such as flute, jug-pipe, stick with chains on it, and minstrels' pipe.
Musical remains of nature-magic were preserved in some children's songs.
Lullabies were adjusted to the rhythm of rolling, they are simple melodies, or without melody, and petting was a typical characteristic feature in them.
The strong rhythmic choosing-rhymes, counting-rhymes and nursery rhymes also refer to their ancient origin.
With the adoption of Christianity a significant change occurred in Hungarian music: the cultural heritage and melodic repertoire, which was already common property in European Christian thinking at around the turn of the millennium were transmitted into the Carpathian Basin together with the new religion.
It is also very important that the network of institutions supporting the maintenance, cultivation and transmission of these spiritual values had already been set up.
Monastic, parish and chapter schools spread literacy, science and music in Hungary, too, and they had remained the only institutes of Western Christian culture up until the end of the Middle Ages.
School education was divided into two main parts: grammatica and musica.
At medieval schools children were obliged to sing for 2-3 hours a day during services.
In spite of the fact that both the music sung and the unified liturgical frame connected Hungary to the European Christian community, a specific Hungarian Gregorian style - different from western Gregorian music - developed slowly.
Hungary adopted the Gregorian repertoire in the Central-European, the so-called pentatonising version.
Data show that around 1028 a monk from Regensburg, called Arnoldus, arrived in Esztergom and there, together with archbishop Anastazius, created a new series of songs in honour of St Emmran of Regensburg, based on ancient writings.
The choir of the cathedral sang these songs on the day of the Saint.
Musicians might have been encouraged to write similar songs by the flourishing cult of saints.
The Hungarian Gregorian repertoire was supplemented by local variants from the beginning.
The first cycle of Hungarian Gregorian music was a series of antiphons and responses written for the canonisation of king St Stephen - probably in Fehérvár.
Its main movement was "God Save Late King Stephen", that survived in the Transylvanian codex from the end of the Middle Ages.
Later, other rhyming chants were created in the honour of other Hungarian saints, like prince Emeric and king Ladislas.
The first liturgical-musical settlement connected to church and state organisation probably took place during Stephen's reign. It influenced the repertoire and the structure of the service (mainly the office), and also the melodic variants, the songs, their order, and the choice of melodic variants.
The birth of Hungarian musical composition, which combined the German neumatic writing and the French-Italian orientation, was also typical of the Hungarian Gregorian music culture; its first manuscripts can be found in the Pray-codex.
At the same time, pipers and drummers were also employed in principal courts. They lived in groups in the neighbouring villages. Minstrels were associated to them, too.
Latin (Western Christian) music songs from the pagan age - first of all in folk traditions - also continued.
DANCE
Concerning the early history of Hungarian dance culture - in the absence of evidence - we can only guess how people in the Carpathian Basin danced at the time of the Conquest.
On the basis of the comparative analysis of the available scanty historical sources and the folk dance of today's European peoples, three big dance regions can be described:
1. South-East-European region: where the dominant dance is the chain- or circle dance, where dances are created in groups, half-settled.
2. Eastern-European region: where individual, free, soloic, improvisative dances dominate.
3. Western-European region: where totally settled, collective, space-formative paired dances (kodrills and contra dances) constituted the basic dances.
According to theories based on the memories of dance history and numerous Western- European sources it turned out that these three regions actually represent the three periods of the historical development of European dance culture.
People from the Balkans, isolated from the European cultural changes for a long period, perpetuated medieval collective chain-round dances up until today.
Eastern-European peoples (including the Hungarians) preserved the renaissance "paired love dances", which became popular at the end of the Middle Ages, at the beginning of the Modern Age, while Western-European peoples preserved quadrilles and contra dances, becoming general in the 18th century.
In this wide historical, geographical and social investigation we have managed to differentiate an older and a newer layer in Hungarian dance traditions, which are definitely dissimilar to each other.
The dances of the old style layer show remarkable similarities with the dances of the neighbouring peoples in the Carpathian Basin.
Circle dances at the borderline of the old and the new layer indicate South-East-European and ancient medieval connections.
In a wider sense, sources from the age of the Conquest suggest that Hungarian culture showed ambiguity even at that time.
In the description of the St Gallen adventure and in the set of martial games, songs and revels mentioned in Anonymus's Gesta Hungarorum, dances occur in an undifferentiated form, just as in Eastern history and folklore.
Iconography from works of art from the 10th-11th centuries, include the joculators on Lehel's horn, and Mirjam-dances on the crown of the Byzantine emperor, Monomachos, and show another dimension of medieval Hungarian dance culture.
They attest to how cultural elements (including those of dance culture) from further territories of Europe reached Hungary through dynastic relationships.
BELIEFS, RELIGION
THE BELIEFS OF THE PAGAN HUNGARIANS
The Hungarians' world of beliefs is known from the art and ethnographic data from the time of the Conquest, but certain historical sources, sagas and archaeological observations have helped in its reconstruction.
The religion of the conquering Hungarians - despite the fact that they met monotheic (Christian, Jewish, Muslim) religions in the course of their history - was basically shamanism.
This is a rather complicated world of beliefs.
The duties of the central personality, the shaman (the Hungarian name for it is "táltos" [magic steed]), might have been very varied.
Many phenomena connected with the shamans, known from today's beliefs, (such as babies born with teeth, meeting ghosts during a trance, climbing the tree of life or grappling with each other) can be found among peoples in Siberia as well.
The traces of this belief are not plentiful, most of them are related to the cult of the dead.
The sacrifice of horses and the tradition of horse burials are known from archaeological findings.
These are verified by the written sources mentioning the sacrifice of the white horse, drinking mare's milk and the compact sealed with blood (which is a symbol of the greatest sacrifice, that of life-force, among strange peoples to gain kinship).
The basis of this religion was a belief in life after death.
Graves were dug on the far side of water - relative to their dwelling-places - and the legs of the dead were directed to the east, towards the rising Sun.
The dead were buried with their everyday objects and supplements relating to ranks.
The decorating motifs on these had their own meanings: e.g.: representations of animal shapes gave proof of totemism, which could refer to kinship with animal ancestors.
Totemism may have been an important factor in the religion of the ancient Hungarians; evidence pointing to this are the legends of origin: the myths of the Turul-bird and the magic stag.
Vegetative ornamentation and the conventionalised tree of life refer to the universe.
There are common elements in the beliefs of the Hungarians and that of the Finno-Ugric people, the basis of which is shamanism and a world concept with three spheres connected by the tree of life.
The upper sphere is the world of gods, planets (Sun, Moon), stars (with the North Star in the center) and good spirits - the place of Heaven, the empire of Light.
Its main personality is Demiurgos, the creative god.
The middle sphere is the world of humans and other supernatural creatures who live outside the circles of man: ghosts, phantoms, demons of diseases and forest and water goblins.
The tree of life (tree of the world) originates in this sphere.
Its branches - forming the axis of the world - hold up the tent-like sky, which is perforated, and this is the origin of the stars.
Its foliage has seven (nine) regions.
The roots of the tree, in contrast to the upper world - as its reflection - reach into the lower sphere.
The underworld, the hell, this dark region over the grave is always the living-place of evil spirits and the devil.
It also has seven (nine) regions, like the upper world.
According to a modern folk belief, which relates back to the ancient religion, an ordinary person can only hear about the tree of life.
It can only be found by someone if they are born with an extra bone and did not eat or drink food other than milk till the age of seven.
This person is the shaman, who is committed to his task from birth.
There are two significant events in his initiation ceremony: there is the introduction to the ghosts, that is, the climbing of the shaman tree, symbolising the tree of life; on the other hand, the libation to the gods, that is, drinking the blood of the sacrificial animals.
By the help of his connections with the ghosts, he gives advice to the community, he explains the meaning of dreams, he mediates between the living and the dead, he heals people, he can drive away malevolent spirits by incantation, he can search for lost spirits and bring them back.
Shamans conduct animal sacrifices, they inquire about the cause of the rage of a furious ancestor, and knows the ways of reconciliation.
They play an important role at fertility ceremonies.
The belief in god-kings developed from the ancestors' cult, too. According to this, gods are the dead ancestors of the living chief prince.
The development of this cult among the Hungarians might have started in the age of prince Álmos. The memory of his murder might refer to this.
The Turul legend (or in other words: Emese saga) might have been formed at that time, too, which indicates that glorious rulers would descend from the Turul ancestor.
At the beginning of the 9th century the Hungarians living in Etelköz (at the lower reach of the river Don) met the Alan-Bulgarian culture, traded with the Arabs, the Persians, the Byzantines. They were also plundering in Franc provinces and imposed taxes on the neighbouring Slavic peoples.
This region was the meeting point of the great religions of the world: the Khazars believed in Jewish teachings, the Muslims of Iran and the followers of Byzantine Christianity also made contact with the Hungarians.
Nevertheless the Hungarians remained unambiguously pagan right up to the end of the 9th century - as the Byzantine emperor, Leo the Wise, and Muslim sources testify.
After adopting Christianity, the pagan world of beliefs was gradually pushed into the background.
The former view of the world, the belief in loyal heroes loosened, but it survived in other forms: legends, myths, rhymes, motifs in tales and ritual songs.
People preserved their mythological beliefs in folk art.
The religion of the Hungarians, who occupied the Carpathian Basin, - just like their farming and social structure - drastically changed in the 10th century.
THE BEGINNING OF CHRISTIAN CONVERSION
Large scale Christian conversion might have begun when leaders Bulcsú and Gyula were baptised in Constantinople in the middle of the 10th century.
Arriving home, Gyula brought Hierotheos, the devout monk, who was consecrated bishop by the Byzantine patriarch, to Hungary.
Organised conversion started and it was given a stimulus when Gyula's daughter, Sharolt, was married to chief prince Géza.
The ruler - father of later king István (Stephen) - showed the Hungarian people a new direction, when he realised that the Hungarians needed to exercise a peaceful policy. The plundering campaigns against neighbouring people had to be stopped, otherwise the country was liable to be destroyed by stronger superpowers at some stage.
The main aspect of Géza's foreign policy was his striving for peace, as the threatening behaviour of the Byzantine empire was a real danger for the country. The chief prince, to stabilize the situation of the tribal alliance, opened up towards the west.
He sent his ministers to the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto I, in spring of 972 to ask whether he supported the conversion of Hungarians to Christianity.
The emperor said yes, and a monk from St Gallen, called Bruno, (who was consecrated converting bishop of the Hungarians by the archbishop of Mainz) arrived in Hungary together with the ministers bringing the reply.
In the autumn of 972 Bruno started the conversion of people, and he was the one who baptised chief prince Géza.
In a very short time he converted a great number of Hungarians with the help of the priests who were sent to the country by Pilgrim, archbishop of Passau.
From a letter sent to Pope Benedict VI in around 973-974 we learn that 5000 men and women had already adopted Christianity.
The letter also mentions that the building of churches had begun in Hungary.
In Esztergom, his newly chosen residence, Géza had not only a castle but also a chapel built for the principal family.
The chapel was built in honour of István, the first martyr (his name was given to his son, Vajk, in baptism - later he became king István [Stephen]).
Bruno of St Gallen and his circles were the founders of St Gallen (Gallus) monastery, and in Pannonia, around Savaria, the propagators of the cult of St Martin, bishop of Tours, who was born at the beginning of the 4th century.
Their memory is reflected in Hungarian St Gallen place names and the establishment of a Benedictian monastery on mount St Martin (Pannonhalma).
After chief prince Géza's death (997) his nephew, prince Koppány, lay his claims for the throne.
He could demand the title of leader of the Árpád tribes and chief prince for himself according to the traditional theory of succession (levirate).
In compliance with pagan traditions he wanted to marry Géza's widow, too.
Koppány did not intend to accept the fact that in accordance with the Christian prerogative of the first-born son (primogeniture), he could not have accessed to power.
Thus before prince István's initiation to chief prince, he took up arms and many of the free men joined him.
The fight of István and Koppány was destined to decide the future fate of the Hungarians.
The rebels represented the old order, they fought for tribal autonomy, ancient rights and the pagan religion.
The rebel leader and his army marched to Veszprém. István and his loyal troops launched an attack against them from the fortress of Esztergom.
The attempt to lead Hungary out of the way of development that Géza had already started failed with István's victory over Koppány.
Neither Géza, nor István could control the pagans without the help of foreign monks, priests and knights.
The situation of conversion drastically changed in 1000, when Pope Sylvester II sent István a crown and his apostolic blessing.
With the coronation of István at Esztergom, Hungary joined the Christian community of European peoples.
King István opened the gates to all the preachers.
All of the first prelates in Hungary came from abroad and queen Gisella also played an important role in spreading Christianity.
The young king started to organise the permanent Hungarian church: he divided Transdanubia into three bishoprics with centers at Pécs, Gyõr and Veszprém, and established the archbishopric of Esztergom to supervise them.
Between the rivers Danube and Tisza the church district of Eger was set up, and in the eastern territories the archbishopric of Kalocsa was established before 1015.
In the western regions of the country a set of monasteries were set up: in 996 on mount St Martin (later Pannonhalma), around 1015 at Pécsvárad, in 1019 at Zalavár and Zobor, around 1020 at Bakonybél.
The last church district, founded by István, was the bishopric of Csanád, the head of which was Gerald, the learned Benedictian theologian from Venice.
István undertook his organization of the church with great caution.
This is clear from the fact that monks Zoerard-Andrew and Benedict, who came to the country - and later became martyrs - were sent to the northern areas, near Nyitra. Bishop Gerald - who was canonised together with István in 1038 - was directed to the southern part of the country, where Christianity had already taken roots due to Byzantine conversion.
Missionary activities and pastoral duties of the Orthodox church were performed first of all by Slav monks and temporal priests who spoke Hungarian.
Church organisation had already been completed during the life time of the first king of the Hungarians, St Stephen, but the dangers threatening Christianity did not pass.
This was shown by the murderous attempt against the elderly king and the subsequent revenge: prince Vazul was passed over; his sons, prince Andrew, Béla and Levente, were exiled (later they were going to play an important role in the history of the Árpád dynasty); the conspiracy against the successor to the throne, István's nephew, king Peter from Venice, and numerous pagan revolts.
HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
The main regions of Hungary in the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the first millennium were the following: Transdanubia, the Great Plain, the region east of the river Tisza, the Northern mountain range and Transylvania.
Geographical conditions had not been changed since ancient times, except for changes to the surface. In the case of ancient settlements, there is a 3-6 metres filling, in case of medieval settlements there is a 1-2 metres filling.
In the Middle Ages there were more watery regions in the Great Plain than today.
According to historical sources the Hungarians crossed the river Dnyeper in about 837 and occupied the steppe of Etelköz before 860.
The extremely cold winter of 892-893, which was mentioned even in Eastern Franc year-books, had its influence on the Conquest.
Following this a dry period set in which grew milder with the turn of the millennium.
In all probability, the Hungarian people came to the Carpathian Basin through the valleys and passes of the Eastern and Southern Carpathians.
The ancient vegetation of the Carpathian Basin can be reconstructed with the help of pollen analysis.
The influence of extensive farming and vast deforestation is observed only from the late Middle Ages.
Vegetation zones from the Great Plain towards the Carpathians are similar to those from the Ukraine towards the north-east: dry steppe, scrubby, grassy steppe, woody steppe, bread-leafed forests, then pinewoods. This facilitated the passage of the travellers to this territory.
The typical plants of flood areas are the groves of willows and poplars, elms, ash trees, oaks, tall forests, reedy swamps and peat-bogs.
Saliferous territories were found only in negligible numbers.
These flora populations remained basically untouched until the 18th century.
The oak forests, rich in game made for excellent hunting and masting places.
By widespread clearing, grassy meadows and pastures were created.
The next layer of vegetation is the region of oak forests (they can be found in the territory between the Danube and the Tisza even today).
Greens and ancient wastes of fertile, loessy ridges of hills were broken for cultivation.
On hilly territories, above 250 metres, there is the living space of closed oak forests and birch trees.
In the mountains we can find the zone of closed oak-beech wood, higher up the zone of silver fir-beech wood, although these were not occupied by the conquering Hungarians.
The Hungarian people entering the Carpathian Basin between 895-900 have enjoyed a continuous history with a sovereign state for 1100 years now.
The domestic names of Hungary (for example: Magoria, Magor, Magerorzag) can only be found in written sources dated from Hungary.
The majority of the names used abroad originate from the Onogur name of people, such as Hungaria, Hongrie, Hungarlandt, Ongaria, Ongrie, Ungaria, Ungern, Ungheria, Ungria, Ungrie, Vngern Land, Unkuriya.
Sometimes - in the usual manner of early medieval times - it was called by the names of former states that used to have some connections to this territory. For example: Avaria, Celtica, Hunia, Pannonia, Scithia, Turkia.
The medieval borders of Hungary were settled at the turn of the 11th-12th centuries: they were the eastern spurs of the Alps, the rivers Lajta and Morva, the Northern, Eastern and Southern Carpathians, the rivers Danube and Sava.
The geographical conditions of the territory are quite favourable.
It is rich in rivers abounding in water and suitable for boats.
The surface is rather varied: with huge lowlands, swamps, hills, mountains and basins.
In the climate of the country, continental and Mediterranean influences are mixed.
As a result, the fauna and flora are equally various.
The plains are covered with groves, forests and wastes, on the hills and mountains there are huge forests, in higher region alpine plants can be found.
The territory was rich in birds, fish and games (including some species, which are now extinct: sterlet, bear, wolf, bison, chamois).
The country was rich in natural sources.
Precious and non-ferrous metals were produced in mining towns of Upper- and Lower-Hungary, and ore mines of the Eastern Carpathians and Transylvania.
The most important seasoning and preservative of the Middle Ages, salt, was mined in Transylvania.
The emerging Hungarian state was at the meeting point of two great cultures: Western Latin and Eastern Greek Christianity.
In the long run, the western pattern had the stronger influence on the country. Its eastern border was at the same time the border of Western Christianity.
The influence of western-type Christianity on Hungary is shown by the structure of the state, culture and the adoption of the Latin alphabet.
From the beginning there were various ethnic groups in the country, and the first king of the Hungarians, St Stephen, assumed responsibility for them. He took care of these groups and entrusted them to the care of his successors.
The fate of early medieval Hungary is an organic part of the development of European history.
In conformity with the level of economic development, people were engaged in self-sufficient farming in the country.
Although there was commodity production and circulation of money, agriculture and handicraft industry had not yet separated then.
WAY OF LIFE
ECONOMY
Due to a lack of sources, the Hungarians' ancient way of life and economy is difficult to characterize.
The complexity of economy at the age of the Conquest is shown by the fact that it consisted not only of nomadic grazing, hunting and fishing, but also of agriculture.
Animal husbandry
Animal bone findings at excavations point to the fact that animal husbandry was probably multifold and rich. The remains of altogether 10 species of animals were found (horse, cattle, sheep, goat, swine, camel, dog, hen, goose and duck).
Presumably two further species - donkey and cat - were also included in the live-stock.
Besides European species, the remains of animals brought from abroad (tarpan horse, ancient sheep, camel and buffalo) were also found.
Their horses, which could bear all the vicissitudes of outdoor life, did not require stables, though people knew how to store fodder for the winter.
In compliance with pagan traditions, the ancestors of the Hungarians ate horse meat during animal sacrifices and funeral ceremonies, but there are no traces of them eating raw meat.
According to a widespread, but false belief, the Hungarians ate meat softened under the saddle.
The origin of this might be the tradition, which still exists among Central-Asian equestrian people, that they put raw meat under the saddle so as to heal the wounded backs of horses (due to hard wooden frames).
From this point of view this tale may be a valuable piece of information in case it refers to ancient animal healing.
The horses of the conquering Hungarians originate from tarpanes.
The majority of their horses were Eastern-type horses, but they also had smaller Western-type and tall Iranian horses.
Their appearance was not considered to be important. Their physical characteristic features were important though.
They kept their horses in rigorous weather conditions.
A stud of 20-25 horses contained 5-6 mares, some stallions and some foals.
The stud was grazed further from their quarter. The horses, which were used every day, grazed near their dwelling-place all through the year.
Foals were ridden from 2 years old. They made kumis from the milk of mares.
Keeping horses in studs and stables brought a drastic change in horse-breeding.
Hungarian horses became more and more popular abroad, and trade in horses began.
The Hungarian cattle were also hardy animals. The herd lived in the open air.
On the basis of bone findings from the 10th-11th centuries their short-horned cattle were about 1 meter high.
A unique archaeological finding from the age of the Conquest, a silver belt- mount, shows cattle of this kind.
Ox-bone findings show that they were also used as draught animals, besides being kept for their meat and milk.
The third animal of typical nomadism is sheep.
The Hungarians' ancestors had sheep with horizontally directed, widely twisted horns. The ewes of this species were sometimes hornless.
The sheep is a utilitarian domestic animal, all its body-parts can be made use of. Its fleece is a first class basic material for making felt, its skin can be used for making clothes.
In the meals of nomadic people mutton came only after beef in order of importance.
Only a few archaeological findings refer to the keeping of goats at the age of the Conquest - goat bones can be distinguished from those of sheep by comparing their skulls. Goats have horn stumps.
Pork was fundamentally less significant in the diet of ancient Hungarians.
They brought this red, calf-size animal from the East, too - which proves a certain stage of settled life-style in Etelköz.
This species is a direct-line descendant of the boar; they bear striped piglets even today.
The greyhound-like hunting dog of the Hungarians is represented not only in the pictures in Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle), but also archaeological findings from the age of the Conquest give evidence of this fact. Usually a dog was buried with a set of blue pearls around its neck (against evil spirits).
In all probability the "kuvasz" (a Hungarian sheep dog) was also a contemporary hunting dog. Due to its courage and strength it was used during hunts for big games.
Dogs of this kind can be found all through the steppe, from Mongolia to the Carpathian Basin.
When hunting with hawks clever, obedient pointers and greyhounds were used.
The hens of the conquering Hungarians were reddish-brown. They were small with partridge-like plumage.
They weighed about 750 grams, their eggs were half as big as the eggs today.
The wild goose, and the duck were also domesticated (from the eggs of wild ducks).
Along the southern edge of the Hungarians' route to the Carpathian Basin camels can be found everywhere, so they must have been familiar with it, although camel bones were not uncovered where other objects from the age of the Conquest were found.
The representations of the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle) are, of course, not decisive proofs concerning the date of their adoption.
Only one thing is certain, namely, that king Béla III gave three camels to Frederick Barbarossa's army of crusaders.
Hunting
Hunting played an important role in the life of stock-breeding nomadic people. It was not only a means of obtaining food, but also served as military exercise.
Its most popular from was hawking.
Besides hunting with hawks and bows and arrows, they killed smaller animals with the help of traps, daggers, snares, pitfalls and digging holes.
Fishing
In the life of nomadic people, fishing was a winter activity.
In winter the nomads moved to valleys - especially near the banks of bigger rivers - with their animals, and caught fish, to supplement their winter food-supply.
The oldest form of fishing is barrage-fishing, but the ancestors of the Hungarians also knew of the net, harpoon and fishing rods.
Farming and gathering
The ancestors of the Hungarians had already encountered farming on the South-Russian steppe.
Seeds were simply thrown onto the unbroken soil, and then the soil was turned over with ploughs.
Their most important seeds were millet, wheat and barley.
The grown crops were harvested with sickles.
They used grinding stones or hand mills for grinding.
They also had short scythes and spades with iron attachments.
This kind of farming was the same as today's localised, manuring farming, as they sometimes abandoned the fallow lands and cultivated others.
This was the beginning of soil-changing cultivation.
Besides this the ancient Hungarians' subsistence extended to wild fruits, edible mushrooms and natural honeys.
They found honey in nature, but they might have known forest bee-keeping as well.
The richness of the Hungarian word-stock referring to vine-growing gives evidence that the ancient Hungarians were no strangers to either wine or beer.
They drank various other spiced drinks, including kumis, made from the milk of mares.
CRAFTSMANSHIP
Alongside keeping animals, hunting, fishing and farming, different handicraft activities came into existence - undoubtedly to produce the necessary tools.
Archaeological findings from the age of the Conquest and the founding of the state refer to the following trades: manufacture of bows and arrows, smithery, making of saddles, goldsmithery, leather-work, bone-work, conversion of timber and pottery.
For the makers of bows and arrows the basic material, glue, was provided by fish, with the help of which they made such fearful weapons that terrorized the whole Western world.
Bows were made of hard and soft wood, elastic animal sinews placed into layers. The layers were pressed and tied together, or sticked together with glue gained from boiled fish-bladders.
Using backstriking, so-called reflex-bows, reinforced by bone-plates carved from antlers, required special skills. For this reason, their users must have practised it from early childhood.
The different-shaped arrow-heads for feathered arrows - in accordance with their purpose - were produced not by bow and arrow makers, but by smiths.
Besides arrow-heads, smiths made various weapons (axes, spears and spontoons), harnesses (curb-bits, stirrups and strap-clips) and tools used in agriculture (ploughs, spades, sickles, axes).
Among the archaeological remains are found smithery workrooms in pits, workrooms half-dug into the ground and surface workrooms, and mounds.
Among the findings were forged knives and indented sickles, on which we can see iron and steel layers welded together.
Forges and iron furnaces separated in the 11th-12th centuries.
Although contemporary written sources do not mention them, archaeological findings unambiguously verify that the conquering Hungarians knew about precious metal and iron-smelting.
Saddle-makers made pommels from hard linden-wood, and pads from soft poplar- or birch-wood.
Stirrups, - that make riding safer - were fastened to the sides of the saddle. Their bottoms were rounded, consequently the ancestors of the Hungarians must have ridden their horses in soft-soled boots.
The smithery of the age of the Conquest is known from archaeological findings.
The most popular basic material besides bronze, was the holy metal, silver, which was either cast or embossed from plates.
The background was richly gilt, so floral patterns were further emphasised.
The most well-known objects from the age of the Conquest may be the variously formed pouch-plates that also served as indicators of social status.
On discs and bracelets - attached to women's clothing - there are animal-shaped decorations.
Typical jewels used by ordinary people were hair-rings with S-endings, half-moon shaped hangers, band-rings, bracelets.
The jewellery of dignitaries was different from those of common people. Dignitaries had jewels made of gold, while common people wore bronze or silver jewels.
With the founding of the state, smithery inherited from the ancient world view of the age of the Conquest, was broken off.
Numerous written sources, ecclesiastical inventories and place names refer to 11th century smithery.
Consecrations of altars are mentioned in king St Stephen's legends, though real objects survived only in very small numbers.
Royal minting in Esztergom was made in the forge of the court, and it also satisfied the unique orders of ecclesiastical and secular dignitaries.
Initially, leather-work was considered as an activity only done by women.
The basic material was sheep- and rarely cattle-skin.
From ancient tanning methods, the Hungarians used grease- and alum-tanning.
Alummed Hungarian leather soaked in warm tallow became famous throughout Europe. Primarily it was used for making harness (saddle, bridle and reins).
(Alummed leather was called Hungarian-style currying by the French in the Middle Ages.)
Other objects of every-day use or objects of clothing that were made of leather - for example: leather bottles, pouches, belts - were the products of saddlers, or in the case of clothes, were products of furriers.
Bone is an ancient basic material for making every day objects.
Bones, antlers, teeth or tusk of game and domestic animals were used.
Clips, awls, needles, crucibles, bow stiffeners and various toys were made of bone.
Amulets were made of teeth, combs and the decorations on the end of sticks were made of antlers.
Drinking horns were made from cattle-horns.
The ancient Hungarians' carpentry tools were hatchets and axes.
A vast quantity of wood was needed for mining and smelting ores.
Excellent-quality wood was used for making every day objects and weapons (saddles, yurts, bows, scabbards of swords and sabres).
The most frequent archaeological findings are products of contemporary pottery.
Objects were placed in graves during food- and drink sacrifices. Clay pots have been found and assume various forms, according to the possibilities of use.
They were usually made on hand discs, and decorated with various engraved lines.
Remains characteristic of nomadic grazing are clay cauldrons used for open-air cooking.
SETTLEMENT AND DWELLING PLACES
Continuous movement and migration to supply animals with the necessary grazing grounds, were essential parts of life in the steppe.
Its customary rhythm was determined by the alternation of seasons.
A typical feature of the nomadic life-style was the use of round tents, the so-called yurts, that were portable and easy to take apart and put together.
Yurts have dome-shaped roofs, grated sidewalls and were covered with multi-layered felt.
During migrations, they were carried on pack animals, though sometimes they were fastened to carts.
Their inner space division was strictly determined.
Facing the door, men owned the right side, women had the left side, and the place next to the door was the place of daily work.
The fire-place was in the center and its smoke could leave freely through a hole on top of the yurt.
This hole could be closed by a blanket that was pulled by a string, and the door was covered with a carpet.
The house thus consisted of only one room.
People's properties, clothes and foods were kept in leather sacks or wooden chests placed near the wall, covered by carpets.
Weapons and objects of every day use were hanged on the wall, which was made of laths.
The Hungarians used these yurts as their summer place of living long after the Conquest.
The network of settlements of the Hungarians was not unified when arriving in the Carpathian Basin. The layers of contemporary society can be reconstructed from the types of dwelling-places.
The majority of the population lived in the so-called summer or winter quarters. Then, winter quarters grew into villages.
Courts of tribal and clan leaders were different, they also functioned as market places.
This network of settlements was not influenced by the organisation of the state and church at the turn of the millennium.
Besides changing summer quarters - as the importance of farming grew - the permanent winter quarters became village-like settlements.
In the villages of the 10th century mud houses half-dug into the ground came into general use, then dwelling- and outhouses appeared built on the surface.
These buildings were the equivalents of house-types that were widespread all through contemporary Eastern-Europe.
The changing of settlements and house-types can be explained by the economic changes.
At the beginning the conquering Hungarians led a nomadic life-style.
Accordingly they grazed their herds from spring to autumn, though they had permanent winter quarters surrounded by cultivated lands.
As a result of their permanent settling down following the Conquest, smaller villages were formed.
The village with fixed borders (villa), the leader of which was the villicus, appeared already in King Stephen's laws and deeds of gift - as dwelling-places of common people.
As elements of the forming county-system, wooden or timber fortresses were built, also serving as centers of clans and castle districts.
Fortresses were dwelling-places of a different type and size, protected by entrenchments or mounds.
Fortresses in the 10th-11th centuries were typically built on small hills emerging from flood planes of rivers, or on peninsulas or ridges of hills, in other words, on a place of strategic importance.
Medieval towns in Hungary - legally - appeared only at the turn of the 12th-13th centuries, though there were settlements formerly that functioned as towns, or played an important role in the regional division of work.
First of all, places with consumption needs bigger than the average, or places that served as a forum for the primitive exchange of goods could be counted as urban settlements, including principal and ecclesiastical centers.
Under the protection of the lord's fortified place of living, there may have been markets as well.
Around market places there were villages of artisan servants or ethnic groups engaged in trade.
During the foundation of the state, the king's most frequent residence was the fortress of Esztergom. This was also the residence of the first Hungarian archbishopric at the same time.
Székesfehérvár became - first of all - a sacred center, since the founder of the state was buried here.
For this reason, it later became the coronation and burial place of Hungarian kings, and the crown jewels were also kept here.
The Hungarians - even in their home at Etelköz - lived along important international commercial routes.
They took part in fur-, wax- and the slave-trade.
Trading with the Byzantine and the Arabs did not stop after their arrival in the Carpathian Basin either. There are written sources mentioning the export of slaves and horses, and the import of tin and fur.
Although the main branch of economy was subsistence farming, towns already appeared at the age of the foundation of the state to settle the necessary exchange of goods.
Firmly paved roads built by the Romans in Pannonia and rivers suitable for shipping played an important role in medieval communication.
Sources from the 11th century already mention boat traffic on the Danube, but landing places were also known.
In land communication the most important animal was henceforward the horse.
In the 10th-12th centuries merchants carried their goods on horses or for shorter trips on foot.
The means for long-distance transport of goods had formerly been the two- or four-wheeled carts.
They were hardly ever used for transporting people, as a horseman could move about 100 kilometres a day, while a cart could only travel 20-30 kilometres.
King Stephen's orders extended to the system of measurements as well.
The foot of Bavarian-Caroling origin, that was 16 inches or 1/10 fathom, was the basic unit of linear measure.
The royal fathom became the basic unit of land measure, the original of which - made of rope - is kept in the treasury at Székesfehérvár.
According to the Roman tradition widespread in Europe and the local Hungarian practice of ploughing, the measurement of the royal acre - that was 12 x 72 royal fathoms - was formed.
Coins had an important role in the forming of weight measurements.
The units of volumetry were established in the realm of corp-, hay- and hemp work: such as a sheaf of, a handful of and cart of something.
Besides royal measurements, general and local measurements were created. Although widespread, these measures were not at all precise.
EVERYDAY LIFE
Labour Division Between Genders
In the life of the Hungarians' ancestors men's and women's work was separated.
Women had to do the cooking and baking.
They used vegetables, onions, peas, horse-radish and various kinds of lettuce.
Big clay cauldrons were used for cooking.
Different kinds of pots may have been made from wood or leather.
Griddle bread was made by pouring batter on the hot griddle in the oven.
Women had to make clothes, carpets and felt, they directed the moving and the setting up of portable felt-tents.
Women dealt with tasks concerning the house but they also had to take part in hoeing the garden.
Duties connected to animal husbandry were done by men, of course. Thus milking was men's work, while women had to make the kumis according to the tradition of nomadic people.
Spindles were used for spinning, horizontal waving looms were used for weaving.
After the Conquest weaving looms with treadles were adopted.
Girls and women made felt (it is a textile made from the fleece of sheep) that was used for various purposes: clothes (coats, boots and caps), pouches, blankets, coarses under saddles and - most important of all - tent covers were made from it.
Clothing
Presumably both sexes wore similar items of clothing: shirts made of hemp or flaxen linen, kaftans or coat-like upper garments, loose trousers and boots with a slightly rising toe.
Shiny mounts also decorated their clothes according to social rank, age and dignity.
The arrangement of objects found by archaeologists in graves helps us to reconstruct part of the clothing.
A typical indicator of rank of equestrian nomadic men was the mounted belt.
Boys were initiated as men by receiving a belt. The quantity and quality of belt mounts showed the social status of its owner.
Their weapons and pouches containing their tools were hanged onto this.
Men wore pointed leather or felt high caps, the sides of which could be turned down to protect their ears.
Women wore clothes that may have been more richly decorated than men's clothes.
Girls wore headdresses, richer women wore high caps decorated with disc and hanger mounts or fur.
Their jewels were various ear rings, braid rings or discs, beads strung onto a necklace, half-moon shaped hangers, bracelets and rings.
Diamond shapes mounts and double mounts with hangers were sewn onto the stand-up shirt collars of women and children's clothes.
They wore a brocade or silk caftan over their shirts decorated with beads or metal buttons (pityke) hemmed with square or half-moon shaped mounts with hangers or pressed rosettas.
They braided polished shells and beads into their plaits and put decorated discs at the ends.
Bracelets gathered up the sleeves of their clothes.
Hair rings with S-endings made of bronze or silver were typical common jewels at the age of the Conquest and the foundation of the state.
Bracelets ending in animal head decorations might have had a protective role. They were quite popular at that age.
The clothing of high society was the skived fur upper garment, the "suba".
Gowns might have been felt blankets, put on the shoulder in bad weather.
Other typical items of clothing were the patterned tunic, gloves, short fur upper garment (smock-frock), boots sewn on the side with rivets and decorated uppers and silk shirt closing in the middle or at the left shoulder.
After adopting Christianity usually only simple leather or textile belts were buried - iron and bronze buckles show this.
People wore hollowed relic holder crosses on their neck or cast chest crosses.
Hairstyle has indicated the difference between genders and generations since ancient times.
It may have denoted social rank as well, and in the case of women it might have been a traditional sign.
Healing
We have hardly any data about how people at the age of the Conquest diagnosed and healed diseases.
The fact that they knew some herbs and healing techniques and relevant traces of the ancient belief provide some information about the topic.
The only thing we surely know is that trepanation - which requires serious anatomical and surgical knowledge - was widespread among the ancestors of the Hungarians.
