Pets
A new pet passport was introduced in 2004 making it easier to travel with pets.
All cats and dogs will need one, and it will be accepted across the EU as proof that a pet has received the anti-rabies vaccination.
However, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom also require proof that the vaccination has been effective.
The necessary tests must be carried out at least six months prior to travel to Ireland, Malta and the UK and 120 days beforehand in the case of Sweden.
An electronic microchip will be introduced over the next eight years to allow easy identification of the animal.
In the meantime a tattoo can be used as identification except in Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom where a microchip is already required.
It can also contain other details of the animal’s medical history.
