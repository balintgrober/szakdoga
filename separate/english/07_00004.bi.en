PART ONE
GULLIVER AMONG THE HINS
CHAPTER ONE
Author's country is threatened by dangers, he resolves to offer his services - He is assigned to the cruiser "Invincible" and starts for Shanghai to protect culture - His encounter with the Italian ship - The cruiser is sunk by explosion but author has a merciful escape
The Reader who may have found my former humble works worthy of his attention may well be surprised to learn that after so many adventures and severe trials I have put to sea again.
I can assure the Reader that now, having returned from Kazohinia and looking back to my sufferings among the Hins and particularly among the Behins, I am of completely the same opinion.
Thus may I mention, not by way of excuse but by way of explanation, that on this occasion, apart from my accursed adventurous spirit, it was the protection of Great Britain and Christian civilization that prompted me to travel anew.
And I ask the educated Reader whether there is a more worthy calling for a British subject than to serve under the Royal flag the elevated ideas of mankind and Christianity against their sworn enemies.
Possibly the circumstance that my voyage to Kazohinia led me to hitherto entirely unknown territories and afforded me such extraordinary experiences as no fellow-being had previously undergone also deserves some appreciation.
In particular my becoming acquainted with the Behinic disease, however, raised my hopes that my travels had not been in vain and that by describing my experiences I should be able - in proportion to my humble faculties - to perform some service to my country and to medical science.
I am perfectly prepared for the Reader to accept my narrative with an occasional shake of the head; I therefore mention in advance that in the course of my work I have always striven to describe everything with the strictest objectivity.
Should, however, some parts of my book still furnish opportunity for doubt I shall not be unduly surprised.
Kazohinia is so remote from my country and European civilization that both the customs there and particularly the Behinic disease are completely unknown to us, and had I not seen them with my very own eyes I would possibly not believe that they exist and that they are indeed as they are.
If now, having compiled my accounts of this voyage, I nevertheless publish them all, this proves only my devotion to the objective truth which, faced though I was with the inevitable doubts of the Reader, prompted me to describe these definite facts.
Mankind, redeemed of his sins, was writing "one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five" when the government of His Majesty came to the conclusion that, in all probability, we should have to wage war with Italy.
To the educated Reader I possibly need not explain in detail that the differences of opinion had arisen as a result of the actions directed against the Ethiopian people.
It is beyond doubt that Italy entered this action with the intention of extending her territories-an action which an English gentleman can take cognizance of with a measure of respect, even if perpetrated by the enemy.
And lest the Reader should accuse me of partiality, I hasten to add that this was appreciated by every decent inhabitant of Great Britain.
Especially were we deeply impressed by the enthusiastic generosity of the Italian prelates as they sacrificed money, valuable crosiers and bejewelled crosses of gold on the altar of the country in order that incendiary bombs, bayonets and even tanks be purchased for the noble purpose.
We were all deeply impressed by the spirited pastoral letters in which they did not cease to encourage, with patriotic words, the shepherds, farmers, fishermen, fishmongers, grocers, piemen, icemen, longshoremen, ginger-bread makers, candle-dippers, beggarmen and thieves alike to go to the front and spread culture and the true Christian virtues among the Blacks, while they would ceaselessly implore the Saviour and the Virgin of Loreto in devout prayer that the grace of Heaven should succour those bearing arms for a noble cause.
At the same time we willingly recognized the heroic feats of the Italian soldiers whose death-defying courage and other honourable virtues might well be followed as an example by every loyal British subject of character, naturally under the Union Jack, and against the Italians.
I repeat that as regards the how of the matter there was no discord between my country and Italy; it was merely the why of it which provided a basis for disagreement.
As their motive for the Ethiopian action, the Italians put forward their desire to liberate the Ethiopians from the yoke of the Amharas and to spread culture. The obvious untruthfulness of this-with all due respect-must prompt every sober-minded and better educated person to laughter if he has even but a passing knowledge of the diplomatic phrases customary in other countries when they wish to gloss over the essence of things and thereby mislead the uninitiated observer.
I have no wish to slip into the error of partiality in the way of travellers who are not above a disproportionately ostentatious display of the glory of their country in the guise of scientific description; I believe, however, that with all modesty and due respect to foreign states I might mention that adoption of such a perspective is an error a British subject would never commit.
In my country it is well known even to the less educated that the devoted but noble work of liberating the peoples of the tropics has always been a heartfelt duty of Great Britain. Sufficient proof may, I feel, be found in the many colonies from South-East India to the Boers, whose peoples were set free from oppression at the cost of heavy battles.
And, much as an English gentleman is left cold by the material aspect, I cannot conceal my opinion that, apart from the cause of culture and freedom, Italy, in making her decision, may have been influenced, possibly unconsciously, by Ethiopian coffee and oil-fields.
This is why the government of His Majesty, having made sanctions against the Italians, came to the decision to launch a defensive war against Italy.
With this end in view and to ensure peace and balance of power in Europe, several divisions were urgently posted to Egypt with aeroplanes, tanks, flame-throwers and incendiary bombs, while battleships were dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea accompanied by torpedo-carrying destroyers and submarines.
These actions were of course received with strenuous counteraction by the Italian press. They asserted that, apart from the reasons mentioned, my country's actions had perhaps been influenced by the desire for gain and that she was begrudging a needy people the few oil-wells and mines which did not even approach the sphere of Italy's interests, and would not even have been mentioned had not the British become involved.
The Reader may by now find the political details tedious but it is my strictly determined intention to adhere to the objective truth and always to raise my humble voice in protest whenever unmerited blame is cast upon my country, its navy, its aeroplanes, its tanks, and in general on any of our splendid establishments that distinguish noble man from the beast of prey.
Thus, so as not to lose the thread of my story, it happened at that time that His Majesty's heavily armour battleship "Terrible", riding at anchor in Chinese waters, was dispatched to the Mediterranean and in its place an old tub, the worn-out cruiser "Invincible", was sent to fly the Royal colours and represent the rightful interests of my country with its presence.
The task of the "Invincible" was not at all easy as my country's interests were strongly threatened in the Far East by the danger of Japanese expansion; even some sections of the Chinese people were in rebellion against the concession belts representing culture and civilization, and it was on account of these interests that the "Invincible" had to be stationed at Shanghai.
My country was resolved to secure a European-type civilization in the East, too. The conflict with Italy, however, did not then permit it, which opportunity was thoroughly utilized by Japan who herself began to spread civilization in northern China, in full concord for the time being with the Covenant of the League of Nations and my beloved country.
The "Terrible" was replaced by the "Invincible" for a further reason, too; this was that if the Japanese sank it the damage would be comparatively insignificant and the case would not require consideration as hostile action.
Although this intention was a strictly confidential naval secret, it nevertheless leaked out to the crew, and, as a direct result of this, several requests for transfer were received.
These requests were turned down by the Admiralty, whereupon many people deserted.
The government was compelled to resort to other methods as it was to be feared that the forced personnel would jump ship in Shanghai.
Accordingly double salary was promised together with life insurance for a high sum.
At that time I was serving aboard the cruiser "Trafalgar" as surgeon, and having returned home one day I made mention of the matter to my wife.
My wife, who was the paragon of the faithful partner in marriage, as well as a good mother, and who as a zealous and chaste spouse had never ceased to rouse me with her frequent advice and urgency in my duties as a husband, immediately grasped the situation and enjoined me not to hesitate in having myself transferred immediately to the "Invincible".
With zealous words, she explained that in Shanghai I should have no expenses, nor should I be in a position to spend my afternoons with my frivolous friends in the club and prodigally waste my money at dominoes, but would instead be able to send it all home for the support of my beloved family.
I should have no need for anxiety for them, as to what would happen in the case of my death in action as, apart from the pension, the life insurance would be sufficient for her and the children to cherish my memory as befitted my rank.
The lofty words of my gentle and loving spouse as well as the call of my adored country prompted me to petition my transfer to the "Invincible", which I duly received within a week.
After another week we sailed.
My wife bore the pain of parting with the strength of spirit becoming to a patriotic woman. She did not even accompany me to the port lest she should cause me unnecessary grief, but to ease her aching heart, she hastened to the dressmaker to try on the dress she had ordered for the tea-party, which was to be given by Mrs. E. Palmer the next day but one, from my first double salary.
The sailing incidentally took place quite without ceremony.
On October fourth but half an hour after embarkation, the "Invincible" weighed anchor, and after three cheers and some cap-waving we put to sea.
Already on the eighth we were passing through the Straits of Gibraltar.
After another four days we reached Malta where we took on coal, oil and fresh water but we continued our voyage. On the fourteenth we arrived at the Suez Canal through which were moving several Italian troop-ships accompanied by some torpedo-carrying destroyers and the battle-cruiser "Il Duce". This had earlier been called "Libert?" but had then been renamed due to the demand of a grateful people liberated from the oppression of the old regime, to which the leader - with all his modesty - could not turn a deaf ear.
Both we and the Italian battleships expressed our joy at the meeting in the most courteous forms.
We each hoisted the flag of the other nation, dipped our own, and fired salvoes partly to convey our friendly greetings and partly to show the other that we had ammunition.
I do not want to bore the Reader by describing the details of our voyage on the Red Sea - though particularly around Aden we enjoyed a magnificent panorama; I will rather continue from the point at which we reached the Indian Ocean.
Our route led widely south of the Equator as it was necessary for us to reach our destination discreetly if possible, so we tried to avoid the sea-lanes of regular liners.
Our next port of call was to be Singapore, which we had to reach by sailing round the island of Sumatra.
We had been cutting through the waves of the Indian Ocean for eight days and already believed that we should arrive in Shanghai safe and sound.
The captain was quite prepared for our ship to be an example of true British tradition so he had two sailors put in irons in solitary confinement and another was threatened with court-martial. This was because they had not polished their buttons properly and had shouldered arms negligently on parade.
Everything was in perfect order.
The guns were polished, the hull repainted; in the end we managed to look as formidable as if we had just come out of dock after being completely refitted.
At about seven o'clock in the evening I was standing beside the gun-turret on the middle-deck.
Near me my friend, a lieutenant-commander, was contentedly rubbing his hands and from the crew's quarters some drawling singing could be heard to an accordion and castanet accompaniment.
It was some old song they had learned in Barcelona.
(Lest the educated Reader should accuse our honest staff of officers of laxity I hasten to add that at that time the Spanish Civil War had not yet broken out, and consequently my country had not then signed the Non-Intervention Pact.)
Suddenly, without any warning, I felt a violent thrust.
The screw-propellers pulled back our ship with full counter-steam; confused shouting and running about could be heard.
I looked around in fear, and understood everything in a flash.
From the distance a long streak was drawing nearer and nearer at an incredible speed.
For an instant I faintly hoped that it would perhaps pass by the prow, but in vain.
I had time only to throw myself on the floor in the recess behind the gun and the next second a terrible force hurled me against the opposite wall and the detonation almost deafened me.
My head was humming from the blow, I was only able to crawl out on all fours.
My friend the lieutenant-commander lay near me, laughing uproariously.
"The blockheads...
The blockheads..." he spluttered.
"They surely believe they've made a lucky hit!
We've played a fine trick on them!...
It was good to have the ten-inch ones swabbed!...
One must burst!"
He would have continued but in the meantime died, while I endeavoured to drag myself quickly towards the stern which was as yet out of the water.
One of the crew threw some lifebelts into the lifeboat after us; another managed to throw in some forty pounds of tins, but then we hastened to get launched and row away as fast as we could lest the wash of the ship should swamp us.
I do not wish to concern the Reader with excessive detail.
It can be imagined how we spent the following pitch-dark night down in the Southern hemisphere, far from every sea-lane, and the significance it had for us when at two after midnight we received no answer to our shouts any more and had to conclude that we had lost contact with the other boats.
We rowed to and fro until dawn and when the sun rose saw nothing but water and more water.
One old sailor repeatedly asserted that there was in those parts a sea current which we had slipped into and by our stupid dodging about we had become still more deeply enmeshed.
I bitterly cursed the foolhardy impulse which after so many trials and tribulations had driven me to sea anew and I beseechingly prayed to the all-merciful Lord of Heaven to rescue me but this once more, and I should never put to sea again.
The only thought that relieved my despair was that my admirable wife and family would inherit my heroic name which, cut in a stone together with many others, would proclaim on the main square of Southampton where foreign citizens should place the wreath.
After the reconciliation even the Minister of Naval Affairs of the state that had had us torpedoed would stand before our monument and pay tribute with zealous eloquence to the heroism with which we had drowned in the sea.
This thought inflated all of us with pride. We realized that a true English patriot cannot expect more from life and with heads erect we awaited our destiny and sang before we were due to perish.
Our preserves gave out on the fourth day.
At noon we opened the last two tins, drank after it the last sip of fresh water and prepared for our glorious death.
At twilight, however, we were lucky enough to be caught in a storm which grew more and more violent. Eventually it so raged that not even the oldest seamen could remember anything to compare with it, and I myself could only compare it with the monsoon that overtook us on my voyage to Brobdingnag off the Molucca Islands.
Everybody put on their lifebelts with sinking hearts and half an hour later, when our boat was already being swallowed by the billows, I decided to try my luck with my lifebelt round my waist.
In another half-hour the storm had blown over, and taking advantage of the opportunity I tried to fasten myself with the strings of the lifebelt.
Thus did I spend the night. The sufferings of this night would, I believe, be unnecessary to describe in detail.
When day dawned I saw nobody around me, but to the even greater pleasure of my faint heart the coastal line of an island appeared before my eyes at a distance of some two miles.
Gathering the rest of my strength I began to swim.
My arms were reinforced in the knowledge that a stone inscribed with my name would proclaim my death as a hero, and, what is more, even though I should live, I should never see my beloved wife again.
After a desperately hard struggle lasting four hours I succeeded in reaching the shore where I immediately collapsed from exhaustion and sank into a deep sleep.
CHAPTER TWO
Author awakes in Kazohinia - He meets Hins who help him generously but misunderstand his respectful gratitude - For the time being, he cannot find the reason for this - His arrival at the Hins' uncommon capital - The English currency is unfairly treated - Author's sense of decency seriously outraged - His experiences in the Hins' restaurant and in the street - His guide invites him to his home
When I opened my eyes it was morning.
My clothes had been dried by the blazing sun, my strength had returned, but I was all the more tortured by hunger and thirst.
I set out towards the interior of the land and soon found myself among beautifully cultivated, enormous rice-fields.
Along and throughout the rice lands ran pipes; through these the water necessary to swamp the land appeared to have been led, as it is well known that this plant requires flooded soil.
I walked along the boundaries of the fields for one and a half solid hours when finally I reached a highway.
I stood there in open-eyed amazement as I had never seen such a splendid road before.
It was made of an especially fine material, softer than concrete, soundless and flexible like rubber, cohesive like gravel and smooth as a mirror.
It was flanked on either side by fruit trees. There were gullies on both sides, and on the right was a separate pavement shadowed by an endless promenade.
At intervals of about fifty yards big outdoor armchairs were situated along the road. They were not, however, woven of reeds or twigs but made of a smooth material which I took for bakelite.
The chairs were surrounded with cypress bushes.
At every quarter mile stood a little house, made of concrete and glass, with a single room the interior of which was about five paces long and just as wide.
A single window running all the way round constituted the walls, the roof being supported by a metal pillar, pale silver in colour, at each of the four corners.
Looking in, I saw a table of wonderful finish which was nonetheless of extraordinary simplicity, with comfortable, springy rubber easy chairs around it.
In the corner there was an electric heater.
In my homeland I had seen similar - but by no means so luxurious - glass rooms at the bus stops of metropolises and along the promenades of fashionable bathing resorts, where the passers-by might take shelter from the rain.
My supposition that they could be for a similar purpose was borne out by the fact that on the door there was no lock.
Along both sides of the roadway, at a distance of about twenty paces from each other, durable-looking, twenty-foot-high lamps stood, each made from a smooth tube with a silvery sheen.
Gradually I came to the conclusion that I was in the park of some very distinguished man.
This beautiful esplanade, these glass rooms, the lamps, could not at any rate be public property, for however closely I examined them I discovered no trace of damage or obscene inscriptions.
Besides everything displayed a much finer workmanship than is customary with things destined for public use.
I wondered only why so much valuable property was not enclosed within a fence.
In turn, it also seemed strange that such a beautiful promenade led among rice-fields and not among ornamental plants.
I should have liked to get away lest I should incur the rightful resentment of the proprietor of the land, but I hurried in vain for the road did not come to an end.
Exhausted, hungry and thirsty, I had just sunk into an armchair when I discovered to my joy that near me stood a small basin with a tap in the middle.
Regretting my less than impeccable instincts here, too, I overcame my due respect for private property and, turning on the tap, let the fresh water pour into my palms and avidly quenched my raging thirst.
Hunger was also gnawing at me and the sight of the trees covered with fruit had almost led me into temptation, so that I was able to save my soul from falling into sin only by strongly recalling the gentle instruction of my venerable teachers concerning private property and the self-restraint which is the ornament and virtue of non-proprietors.
I was already about to give way to despair when a luxury car appeared from afar.
Its outlines were sleek and displayed advanced technical knowledge.
Its dull silvery surface and soundless progress impressed me.
I was certain that the lord of the estate had arrived and started up from my seat in alarm.
At first I wanted to run away, but then thought it better to stand squarely in front of him, honestly disclosing my situation lest - were they nevertheless able to catch me - perhaps I should be taken for a thief.
And, indeed, I was driven by hunger, too.
So I stepped to the middle of the road and opening my arms wide indicated to the chauffeur my honourable intention that I should be happy should they consider my person worth stopping for.
The car did indeed stop.
Inside on the back seat there was another man.
Both had fine features reminiscent of Greek statues and betraying exceptional intelligence, so that if one of them had not been sitting at the wheel I could not have distinguished the lord from the chauffeur.
They were both characterized by a long, straight nose, finely arched eyebrows, lips pressed close, a high forehead and a cold detached look, combining in a peculiar manner a clever and attentive expression.
I had never seen such a fusing of unusual contrasts, and it was all the stranger as their faces did not lack harmony.
That is, not only did opposites meet but disharmony united in them with harmony.
As if a regular geometric figure - were smiling!
A strange, uncertain feeling stole over me.
The chauffeur addressed me in a soft foreign tongue of which I understood nothing, and in reply I tried through gestures to make him understand that I did not want to talk to him but to the passenger whom I thought to be the landowner.
And the landowner, comprehending my wish, got out of the car and stood before me.
It was only then that I perceived that he was dressed in precisely the same way as his chauffeur. Each wore a grey suit in one piece, with a belt round the waist, tightly buttoned at the wrists and the ankles, and fitted out with big pockets, but tailored from a very fine fabric.
It appeared that they used this against the dust when making trips by car.
Each had, further, a light soft cap similar to a beret, fastened to their heads by a rubber band.
I bowed deeply and removed my cap with a wide sweep.
I was surprised, however, to see that the lord did not acknowledge my greeting but looked in bewilderment at the cap extended in my hand and then hesitatingly reached for it, took it away, glanced at it and uttered some surprised words, which, of course, I did not understand.
It was only with great difficulty that I gathered from signs that he thought I wanted to give the cap to him.
I myself felt uneasy seeing that greetings had other forms here, unknown to me, and thought fearfully of the possible awkward and inconvenient situations my ignorance of the rules of the country's finer society might - in spite of my best intentions - place me in during the weeks to come.
Throwing my arms and legs about I began to explain that I had come from the sea, the shore of which I had reached by swimming, and begged his pardon for my trespassing.
At this point I placed my left hand on my chest and bowed deeply once more at which he immediately stepped up to me, undid my clothes and examined my chest where my palm had been.
Obviously he misunderstood me and thought my chest hurt.
Anyone who has been even only once in a foreign country where the local habits were unknown to him will understand my embarrassment, which was only increased by their not laughing at all; in their eyes I could see nothing but matter-of-fact goodwill.
I seemed to have arrived among correct gentlemen who, understanding the awkwardness of the foreigner, politely stifled their justifiable laughter.
Hunger, however, gnawed at me increasingly and, realizing that in this way I should get nowhere, I pointed to my stomach and explained with signs that I was hungry.
I was somewhat ashamed at being compelled to broach such a subject so early but their patient attitude encouraged me.
I was sure that my request in this respect, too, would be received with understanding.
And I was not disappointed.
They fully understood. They looked at each other, then at me, and pointed at the tree in surprise, indicating that I was at liberty to pick the fruits.
This generosity moved me deeply; timidly I picked an enormous pear, and greedily stuffed it into my mouth.
I confess this single pear did not satisfy me, but I did not dare to ask permission to take another one.
I hoped that when they saw my voracious appetite they would offer it to me anyway.
It was then that I encountered my first disappointment in Kazohinia.
The lord, so cordial a moment earlier, did not care a fig whether I continued taking nourishment.
This, I admit, surprised me somewhat unpleasantly.
Oh, had I been familiar with the circumstances, I would not have hesitated to pick as much as I needed! But I was uninitiated.
In any case, I attempted to express my gratitude by smiling pleasantly, as I no longer dared to bow.
Their features, however, remained entirely unmoved, which again seemed contradictory to their former cordiality. They even looked into my face with a certain anxiety.
Then they exchanged a few words with each other and beckoned to me to get into the car.
The honour gave me pleasure and I felt that I should have endeavoured to express my gratitude but did not venture to do so.
The car started off. Then, after about half a mile, it stopped.
The landlord stepped out and went behind the car, and I was surprised to see him untie a shining metal ladder, which he then, with the help of the chauffeur, extended and supported against a lamp-post. The lord climbed up, unscrewed the bulb and replaced it with another.
I was surprised. Why did he not entrust such work to his servants? But as yet I could find no explanation.
Before long they put the ladder back and we continued on our way.
I saw that the lord looked at my waterstained and crumpled clothes with interest and I was extremely ashamed of my unbecoming appearance. I apologized in every possible manner explaining that reasons beyond my control had led me into such an unpresentable state.
I perceived, however, that he took special interest in my badges of rank, and I in turn, seizing the opportunity to offer some proof of my quite respectable social rank, explained what it meant, how many people were under me in rank on board ship and that my rank even entitled me to enter the inner household of His Majesty.
I noticed nevertheless that he did not understand too much of this, and I was worried by the thought that he might not appreciate it properly.
After five minutes we stopped again, the two men got out and I watched them with astonishment as they each put on a dirty overall, and, having lifted a heavy lid from the road, they disappeared below the ground with a portable repair outfit at their side.
Out of curiosity I myself followed them and, looking down, saw that they were repairing cables.
So my destiny seemed after all not to have brought me together with the proprietor of the estate, which again set me in confusion, and I blushed in shame over my former humble behaviour.
Nor did I understand how they had dared to offer me their master's fruit.
I cannot say that I formed the highest opinion of their morals.
After a solid half hour they repacked their kits and we drove on.
We drove for about a quarter of an hour and the landscape remained the same.
Slowly it began to dawn on me that all this could not be the private property of one man.
But what then was all this wonderful technical equipment for?
This I could explain only on strategic grounds as it is only the elevated idea of devotion to one's country that enables man to create on such a scale against aliens.
I tried to ask by signs why they had made the road in such a luxurious way, but he seemed to have misunderstood me as he replied that it was only in order that it should not cause jolting.
The rice-fields were followed by fields of corn, potatoes and other vegetables.
In some places slender concrete water towers, irrigators, pumps, appeared; and then there were people steering strange big silvery machines.
These farmers wore the same kind of clothes as my travelling companions.
Here and there I could already see houses.
Of the first I believed that it was the summer residence of some eccentric grand seigneur.
It was not large; it might in all comprise some two or three rooms but it was an uncommonly precise, perfect and solid building, suggesting a developed culture.
A flat roof, enormous windows with four-five panes, a spacious terrace, a solarium and a roof promenade.
It was surrounded with trees and shrubs arranged in neat rows, but I saw no flowers.
It had no chimneys, but in front of the terrace there was a swimming pool, and also a couch, a hammock and some gymnastic apparatus.
Later I discovered many such villas.
They were all alike.
We stopped once more.
The chauffeur got out, opened a metal cabinet at the roadside and pulled a tube from it to the fuel tank.
At first I thought it was some special form of petrol station, but seeing no attendant, I came to believe that it was a water tap.
He, however, began to pump in a casual manner and the smell indicated petrol.
I had no idea how they protected it from thieves.
Nor did I see an attendant in the neighbourhood, nor was there any petrol gauge, or a lock on its door.
We proceeded.
A few minutes later, without any transition, we arrived in a town.
Two-storey and three-storey houses followed, all in a style similar to what I had seen in the fields.
To begin with I admired them, but later the monotony and lack of ornament gave rise to a feeling that something was lacking.
After such a rich environment I expected showy, turreted palaces.
Wonderingly I watched to see how beautiful the public buildings, churches, theatres and fashionable dancing bars would be with colonnades, arcades, caryatids and illuminated advertisements, but I saw none.
On the contrary, all we came across was more cars and trams.
They ran almost without any noise but at such a speed that I continuously wondered how it was that we did not crash.
At the crossings we raced through underpasses and up on fly-overs. Now above, now under us, electric express trains shot by at a tremendous pace and in what amounted to absolute silence.
Soon I realized that the wheels of the vehicles were not of iron, but of some special, sound-proof material, similar to hardrubber.
But what surprised me most of all was that the countless people, whether on foot or travelling by car or train, were all very similar to each other, and their attire, too, was almost uniform, being similar to that of my travelling companions.
The only variation was that over the suit some wore a grey cloak, which, however, ought rather to be called a cowl, as it had neither collar nor lapel.
Most of them went bare-headed, with only a few wearing the same type of cap as my companions, and of hats I saw none.
Their shoes had no heels. I took them to be slabs of rubber cast from a single piece with vent-holes here and there; they were held together by a single buckle.
The Reader may imagine in what silence cars and men passed by on the rubber roads.
And what is more, the women were also dressed in this way, so at the beginning I thought to see nothing but men.
Why, even their hair-style was uniform; it was worn sleek and cropped around, which could hardly even be called a hair-style.
It was only later that a gentler feature, a finer, lighter move betrayed to me who were women among the many uniform beings.
It was in vain I waited for luxurious shops, too.
I saw some doors with strange inscriptions, but without iron shutters.
As if they were not shops but private apartments with an entrance from the street.
The characters in the inscriptions were very simple geometric figures.
Nowhere a shop window; only the big, square windows in the dull silvery frames I had seen so often and of which everything here seemed to be made.
Now our car stopped, my guide got out and beckoned to me.
I stepped out, the car moved away, while we went to the tram stop.
I was greatly ashamed to be a financial burden to my companion, all the more so since I had naturally only English currency on me.
All the same, I took out my wallet and handed him a one pound note hoping that he would be able to change it at the exchange afterwards.
Regrettably the banknote was rather crumpled as it had been soaked.
My companion turned it over and over scrutinizing it and asking questions with signs, which, of course, I did not understand, and then he simply gave it back to me.
I did not know whether he did it out of chivalry, or whether he was offended at my not being able to give him a banknote in a better condition.
I was beset by doubts but had no time to ponder.
A tram arrived and we got on.
Comfortable rubber seats were there to receive us.
Everything was of silvery metal, glass and bakelite.
I have to state that I had never travelled in such a comfortable and finely sprung tram-car.
People got on and off wordlessly, in a silence scarcely imaginable with us, and with a brisk precision.
I had arrived among a wonderful people.
With all my admiration, however, this automatism was depressing.
Nowhere a smile, a cordial greeting.
Everybody sat with a wooden face, without a single word.
What struck me most, however, was that I saw no conductor in the tram.
In spite of this it started exactly, as the driver kept a look-out in a mirror.
I also looked in vain for a money-box, finally thinking that here everybody carried a season ticket.
I could not comprehend, however, how they checked whether somebody got on who had not renewed his season ticket.
However I brooded over it, I was at that time not yet able to find the explanation.
And this was only the beginning.
We reached a river. On its two banks over a width of about a hundred yards stretched an endless park with the row of villas, already repeated a thousand times, behind it.
As if everybody were a millionaire bachelor here, and the whole town was not older than twenty years.
Not on a single stone of the town did I see anything that would have recalled the past, and I did not see a single work of which I could have said that it gave pleasure to my eyes. I could only marvel at the richness and comfort.
I saw not a single statue nor even a single inscribed monument that might have proclaimed the merits of their great ones.
There was no triumphal arch, bridge-head, nor a solitary fountain that might hint at a delight in art, as would befit such an affluent town.
We left the tram and went underground by escalator.
We were in an underground station.
A minute later a four-car train drew in at lightning speed.
Braking strongly, it stopped.
At that moment the doors of all four cars slid apart, we got in together with other people, the last one pulling the door and the train started.
In this train there was no driver either.
As I came to know later, here everything functioned automatically.
At steps the doors opened by themselves, and the train set off when they shut.
All-embracing safety automatons ensured that it should not crash into the preceding train, and that the running time be duly adhered to.
Under the river we whizzed through a tunnel, and then speeding up the other side we rose above the houses.
We flew en for about five minutes without halting.
Our car whizzed along with unbelievable velocity.
Below us a sea of houses, parks, gardens swirled, rotated and whirled, beside us strange signalling and controlling automatons flashed, and at the bends, the track heeled over at thirty degrees like motor racing tracks, so that the train, too, took them at full speed, and we were practically glued to our seats by the centrifugal force.
I wondered in anguish what would happen if the train were to break down at a bend.
At last we came to a stop, my companion beckoned to me, and we got off.
Things were swirling around me, he caught my arm and took me on to a moving pavement, which like an endless band took us along with it.
From here we stepped on to another, and then to a third band, each moving a little more quickly than the previous one.
On the third belt there were benches on which we sat down.
We travelled in this way for about a quarter of a mile.
I could see the houses from above.
As if in a field or in a park, on every roof I saw plants: grass, shrubs, vegetables and also fruit trees.
It surprised me that there was no chimney on any of them.
Then we stood up and stepping backwards we were once again on the pavement.
One after the other lightning-fast trains whizzed past us.
Now we stepped into a non-stop lift, which took us down to the ground.
I dare say that since swimming ashore I had not had such a feeling of relief.
After the many machine-monsters running to and fro, I stood once more on firm ground.
Now we went a few paces on foot, turned into a side-street, and stopped before a door on which there was some lettering.
At the motion of my companion I entered and took off my cap in politeness.
The door opened before us of its own accord and closed behind us in the same manner.
Inside, in innumerable glass wardrobes lay clothes by the thousand, similar to those worn by everybody.
In the shop, however, (I cannot call it anything else), there was no one.
My companion now took out a tape-measure, measured my waist, and my height to my shoulders; then he reached for a suit of clothes from one of the wardrobes and, placing it before me, indicated that I should put it on.
Just then three people entered: a man and two women.
They conversed briefly, then, in a similar way, set about making their choice among the clothes.
Untying the clothes, I also found a shirt included.
Considering the presence of the visitors, I asked my guide where the fitting room was, but he did not understand my question.
Then I made an attempt, having pointed at the ladies, to imitate dressing; I pointed at the door and expressed that I should like to have a fitting elsewhere.
At this my guide without a word approached one of the ladies, exchanged a few words with her (I have to remark that their speech and words were very brief and easily pronounced) and then returned to me with the lady.
Politely I bowed and, offering my hand, introduced myself.
"I am Gulliver," I said with as benign a smile as possible.
The lady, however, looked at me with a surprised expression without returning my smile, and as for my hand extended towards her, she took it in her hands, turned it over, looked at it closely, scrutinized it, and then, uncomprehendingly, let it drop.
Realizing, however, that my guide had misunderstood my wish, I again tried to make myself understood by pointing at the ladies, the door and the clothes, at which they nodded approvingly and taking my arm led me to the street where something happened to me which I feel ashamed even to relate.
The lady, in the open, busy street undid and pulled off my coat, then kneeled down and also unbuttoned my trousers.
Indescribable shame made me blush and I snatched my trousers together close to my body with a cry of horror.
I explained throwing my arms and hand about that a terrible misunderstanding had occurred, and that I would not have made so bold as to ask for help of this kind from a lady even in my dreams.
They were, however, indicating without any sign of emotion that I must in any case take off my clothes, at which I babbled at random in Spanish, Portuguese and German, explaining that an Englishman could never suffer such a stain on his personal honour, which at the same time represented the honour of his nation.
I threatened them with diplomatic sanctions, but all in vain, for they did not understand.
Quite a few passers-by had already stopped. Some asked questions, and the frightening thought flashed through my mind that I had strayed into a land of lunatics where I was all alone. Nobody would come to my rescue, and I was without protection, exposed to their whims.
"What is yet to come?" I thought of the terrible possibilities, and my forebodings came true all too soon.
For they conferred briefly, and then several of them set upon me and despite all my shouting and protesting, there, in the open street, they held me down, while the lady stripped off my trousers.
I called for the police at the top of my voice but in vain.
Nobody took pity on me, they merely stared inanely and uncomprehendingly at the maltreatment of an unfortunate fellow-being.
My shirt and pants followed, and I lay there exposed to public ridicule, stark naked, surrounded by cars, trams and passers-by.
On the faces of the bystanders, however, I perceived nothing but wonder and perplexity, which then definitely convinced me that I had fallen among lunatics.
Now the lady wanted to put the new shirt on me but I, gathering all my strength, wrenched myself from their hands, snatched the shirt, and covering my private parts with one hand, hurriedly pulled it on.
When the others saw this, they let me go and handed over the clothes, which I put on in similar haste, leaving my old clothes on the spot, afterwards transferring everything from the pockets.
My cheeks were burning with shame and grasping my guide's arm I begged of him that we should disappear quickly.
After a few seconds' consideration, he consented and we went.
Now it was I who led him, and dragging him hastily into a side-street, I again committed myself to his care.
My heart was pounding in my throat on account of this barbarism which made a mockery of all decent feelings.
Human life and freedom seemed to have no protection here, at least until then I had seen no policeman, nowhere was there anybody with pistol or bayonet.
How could they sleep at night?
At the same time I had my own opinion of the decency of the women here, who let themselves be carried away by performing such obscene and immoral acts without the least sense of shame, to which the well-mannered and chaste ladies of my country would never have descended.
And certainly not in the open street!
A country of lunatics and sluts!
The mere thought of it was appalling. That here every woman could be had so cheaply!
I have to admit, however, that the clothes were especially fine and light.
I had never felt so easy and comfortable.
The most softly flowing Scottish textiles could not compare with them.
I had no idea which of the streets we were treading.
All of them were equally wide, edged with shrubs, trees and completely uniform houses; it was only the traffic that made one distinguishable from the other.
My guide now ushered me through another door with some sort of inscription.
The doors, too, were all alike - lockless, each with a glass pane, and requiring no pushing as when somebody approached they opened automatically.
They seemed to be controlled by an invisible beam.
I pondered greatly as to how they might be locked but was unable to find a solution.
Although I tried to ask with signs why they could not be locked, my companion appeared not to have understood as he said that they would not then open.
We reached an enormous restaurant which occupied the ground floor of the whole building.
Only at its end there was a glass partition behind which white-coated figures operated silvery machines the purpose of which was unknown to me.
I was undoubtedly a kitchen but nothing in it was reminiscent of the equipment in our kitchens.
I saw containers and pipe systems with valves and pressure gauges. Mysterious electric instruments inscribed wavy lines on wide paper tapes.
In U-shaped tubes oscillated liquid columns. On a panel behind round sheets of glass coloured signalling lights flashed. There was a swiftly revolving drum and other machine-marvels performed the tasks assigned them.
At the many tables I saw the same comfortable arm-chairs which I had seen so often.
The walls were completely covered with a butter-yellow porcelain-like coating.
It struck me what wide spaces had been left between the tables so that even with all the many people there was no crowding.
Surprising silence reigned, only the jingling of cutlery could be heard.
Between two rows of tables we flitted along like ghosts on the spongy rubber carpet and sat down at the first unoccupied table.
It was only then that I perceived the endless belt slowly moving on the other side of the tables with silvery boxes, cutlery and glasses set upon it at equal distances.
From among these my guide simply lifted off two, placing one before me.
At first I did not know what one was supposed to do with it, but my guide opened his own box and began to spoon the food out of it and I followed suit.
By this time I did not know what to think of these strange people who were sometimes brutal, sometimes gentle and obliging.
And when I tasted the strange, mushy food I exclaimed in rapture.
It was an extraordinary meal.
The heavy savour of roast partridge and the light sour touch of mustard were somehow blended in its taste.
It included the scent of wood, the overflowing symphony of the juice of the succulent white butter pear, the intoxication of full, bodied wines and the refreshing sobriety of spring water.
I may say that the meal tasted of life itself.
It was only now that I realized how hungry I was, for indeed since swimming ashore I had eaten but a single pear.
Greedily I fell to and gulped it down in a trice.
As for my guide, he removed the empty dish without a word and placing it in the middle of the table pushed a button, at which the table opened, the box sank, and then everything closed again.
On the smooth, yellow glass surface the outlines of the drop-door could scarcely be seen.
Then having seen my hunger, my guide took another box from the conveyer belt and set it before me.
So much kind-heartedness touched me beyond measure.
I deeply regretted my earlier thoughts.
Somewhat moved I mumbled some words of gratitude and tears welled up iii my eyes.
Seeing them, my guide bent over and regarded me with visible fright.
Suddenly he took my face between his palms and turning it towards the light scrutinized it with knit brows.
Then he stood up.
"Elo!
Elo!" he cried.
One of the men stood up, and came over to me. My guide said a few words to him pointing to my face, and the man produced a bag from his pocket.
From this he took out a tiny syringe, and holding this to my face he drew off my tears into it, then expressing them into a tiny bottle about a quarter inch in size.
Now, pulling my eyelids down, he began concernedly to examine my eyes and this made me realize that I had come into contact with a doctor.
Again I became seized with terror, and the horrible idea that I had fallen among lunatics haunted me anew.
I wanted to convince him that there was nothing wrong with my eyes. I wiped away my tears and smiled, which caused another sensation.
They conferred briefly, the doctor left, and I sat down to eat the second helping but with considerably diminished appetite.
I did, however, see that, disregarding their imperfections, I had much to thank them for.
It occurred to me that my companion had not been able to pay for my clothes as I had run away and he, lest I should remain alone, had chosen to accompany me, exposing himself to the possibility of being pursued as a robber, and here, too, it was he who entertained me.
I wanted to refund his expenses by any means possible.
I had already seen that he did not know our banknotes, but fortunately I had some gold and silver coins on me.
I emptied my purse and handed over its contents to him.
He turned the coins over and over, examined them thoroughly, and asked by signs what he should do with them. I repeatedly pointed towards the kitchen, but putting the money into his mouth and twisting his face in an imitation of chewing, he indicated that no meal could be produced from them.
I did not exactly know whether it was his generosity that made him jest or whether he merely did not know our money at all.
I tried to explain my intention but explanation was too difficult; finally I gave up, and returned the coins to my purse.
Now my guide beckoned to me; we stood up from the table and left.
I expected him to drop the price of the dinner into some automatic machine.
I intended to watch him carefully in order to seize an opportunity to explain my money in a_ more tangible way, but eventually I had to conclude that he did not pay here either.
Now I was indeed full of curiosity as to their way of life, but there was no way of talking about it.
It was now about six o'clock in the evening. A sea of lights went up in the streets but so well shaded that we could proceed almost with no shadow.
The light was neither yellow nor white, but like the sunshine: a diffusive, clean, quiet flood of light.
We might have walked for about ten minutes in traffic similar to that in the morning.
I could scarcely make out the shapes of the cars slipping along, they disappeared so quickly.
I had never seen so many strange cars.
On one there was a long container with no driver to be seen, from another jib-arms rose high, from yet another an enormous metal mouth gaped forward; I also saw a car which had wheels on top so that it could run upside down as well.
Sometimes a big torpedo-like body drifted over us, closely following a wire but without touching it.
The men on the silent roadways, in soundless shoes; the vehicles, if possible still more soundless; but all were rushing.
This mute witches' dance of machines curiously deprived me of my sense of security, as if there were no force of gravity, only the swish of weightless movement.
The whole had an effect on me as if all of this did not really exist, or at least as if there were no pillars to support it.
And the faces, too, were so strangely unfamiliar: from their unusual proportions emanated goodwill and a repellent inaccessibility.
Suddenly I thought of my comrades with whom I had spent so many pleasant evenings in the club, and who were perhaps now resting at the bottom of the ocean in their watery grave.
My heart sank and I felt a desperate need for a living being, a friend to whom I could talk warmly and relate my impressions of these people. I had the strange feeling that they were not alive.
As if behind this terrible perfection there was no substance.
And, as we were walking, a further feeling arose in me. It gradually took possession of me, although concerning its nature I was not as yet able to give an exact account to myself.
I felt I would welcome the opportunity to throw myself before an altar and to cry.
But why?
I had no idea!
It was interesting that whereas at home I could not have been said to be overreligious, now I suddenly felt I understood the whole genesis of religion and the roots of it hiding within us.
I looked for a church where I could pour out my heart without having doctors gape at my tears.
Pointing towards the sky I tried to ask my companion with signs about a church, at which he, likewise with signs, reassured me that there would be no rain.
That is, he did not understand this either, like so many other sensible questions which had preceded it.
I was not unduly worried by my failure, thinking that I would in any case come across a church, but my search was in vain.
Every house was hopelessly uniform and unornamented and who could tell into which of these cheerless boxes they had squeezed the church.
Now we stopped before a door which likewise opened before us.
We went inside, and then stepped into a lift which carried us to the third and uppermost storey.
Leaving the lift we found ourselves in a gazebo, where all the windows, which looked on to the back garden, were wide open.
Below extended a park about fifty yards in length and breadth; beyond this another house followed, without any intervening fence.
Along the paths comfortable rubber couches and a variety of arbours could be seen, all beautifully lit.
Several people were lying on the couches, others were walking on the paths, but everybody was alone and silent.
Nowhere a crowd, nowhere an intimate group, nowhere a merry, cosy corner, roaring with laughter, or a debating semi-circle.
From the garden rose a concert of crickets and the intoxicating scent of lime-trees.
Inexplicable people!
Behold! They were fond of plants and lay down on the lawns, they had large windows and spacious sunny verandas, in the gardens there were the usual swimming pools - all the property of a man complete in heart.
Why then this self-separating rigidity?
Why did they not honour each other with kind words, or warm friendship?
From the gazebo we proceeded into a room where the lamps turned themselves on as we entered, my guide closed the windows by pushing a button.
The walls were butter-yellow like those in the restaurant.
The room contained three chairs, a couch, an armchair and a square table; none of these was made of wood but of the material similar to bakelite that I had seen so often.
The floor was the same, with no trace of carpet or curtain.
Near the window stood a radiator covered with perforated metal plates, and in the corner a telephone, an electric clock and some other devices the functions of which were perfectly unfamiliar to me.
On the wall, behind some sliding glass-like windows, there were books.
Like the wardrobes, the bed, too, was built into the wall. At the flick of a finger it slid outwards, and when it slid back, the vacuum cleaner located in the wall automatically cleaned and aired it.
Then we went into the bathroom.
I shall not bore the Reader with excessive detail; it is not difficult to deduce the essence from the foregoing.
My host undressed in my presence without reserve, then I had to follow suit in order to wash under the shower, which was very agreeable.
Then he took out some bed-clothes from a wall cupboard and after arranging them on the floor prepared a marvellous resting place and motioned me to lie down.
I admit, I found it a little bit strange that he made his guest lie on the floor.
Not that my resting place was uncomfortable for the rubber mattress would have been equally soft wherever it was placed, but this procedure cast an unfavourable light on the breeding of my host.
I tried to find excuses for him for after all he was apparently only an ordinary electrician. But then what kind of conclusion should I draw from this expensive and extraordinarily fine furniture?
One would, however, expect even an electrician to offer the bed to his guest. He might have known that my good manners would not allow me to accept it anyway.
Sighing, I thought again of my dear country where people were kind and generous and where the host always offered the best to his guest, knowing full well that he would make excuses and take the worst.
I went to bed while my host took out different types of gymnastic apparatus in the form of springs and weights and went to the balcony to exercise.
A quarter of an hour later he came back, lay down and clapped his hands once, at which the light went out.
The excitements of the day kept me awake for a long time. Furthermore, I was not accustomed to retiring so early.
My host seemed to belong among the more prosperous. But why then he did not keep a servant, or why was he not at least married?
My first day in Kazohinia ended with a profusion of unsolved questions and I excitedly awaited the next day for them to be answered.
CHAPTER THREE
Author is examined by doctors - They place him in a hospital among the Belohins and teach him their language - Further, we encounter the kazo concept, the basic principle, or, rather, the prevailing condition of the country
In the morning we arose at six o'clock, showered and dressed. Then my host stepped to the telephone and exchanged a few words with somebody.
He beckoned to me and, holding my face in front of a lens, he continued to talk for a few minutes.
Then he motioned to me and we started out.
In the street the lift carried us up again to the top of the houses, then, by moving pavement, we went to the fast line stop and from there into the train. We shot over the town.
Now I kept a closer watch but could discover no variety - nowhere a tower, a colonnade, an outstanding building; I did not even see a cemetery either.
Once we passed over factories; at least the special arrangement of the buildings, the skylights, and the railways winding about the yard showed them to be so.
But the buildings had no chimneys or fences.
I came to know later that everything was worked by electricity.
Electricity operated the machines, cooked the dinners, baked the bread, heated the rooms, cleaned, washed and aired.
Only in laboratories were open flames known.
Then we passed through fields where the track ran along a raised embankment.
We were among mountains and forests.
Suddenly a big block of houses emerged before us.
Here the train went underground and, braking vigorously, came to a stop.
We got out.
Beside us shone the metal cars of a different kind of train.
Many people got out of them, some with bandaged hands, faces, others being carried on stretchers.
From this I deduced we were at a hospital.
We stepped into a lift which carried us straight into the hall of one of the buildings.
Now my guide led me along corridors, until, entering one of the rooms, I found myself among strange machines.
Two people were walking about among the apparatuses. On our arrival one of them came up to me. My guide, pointing at me, exchanged a few words with him and he in turn bade me sit down on a chair.
My guide now turned without a word and left.
Doubts preyed on my mind as I did not know if he would finally leave me to myself or would return, but he did not take leave of me and so I became calmer, thinking that I would not be alone in the company of a man who knew even less about me than my guide.
My new custodian, who-as became clear later - was indeed a physician, sat down opposite me, observed my pupils, tapped my knees to test my reflexes, and then, having made me remove my shoes, stood me in front of some sort of machine.
On a snow-white enamelled column stood a large flat disc on which several scaled glass windows were situated all around.
From the column projected several dozen jointed metal arms, one of which ended in a metal plate, another in a needle, a third in a suction head, each in a different strange instrument.
The machine was like a hundred-armed Hindu statue of a god.
On the top there were some sharply pointed glittering metal spires.
The physician shoved a chair in front of me and, with mixed feelings, I sat down.
I looked with particular suspicion at one of the arms which ended in a needle.
The doctor took this very arm.
He pulled open my clothes at my shoulder and without emotion pricked the needle into my shoulder blade.
I was just about to protest against this unnecessary torture as nothing was wrong with me, but surprise deprived me of speech.
I felt nothing of the injection, though the physician had not previously anaesthetized me.
I looked at the queer device with amazement.
Behind its windows streaks of light lit up which then oscillated up and down changing colour several times.
The doctor now struck at me with other arms-at my forehead, chest, temple and back.
The lights again oscillated vigorously behind the glass windows; from the metal peaks on the top of the machine electric discharge crackled and then the streaks of light slowly settled.
At this moment there was a ringing sound and winding out from the machine came a wide paper band covered with writing. The physician tore this off and examined it through a magnifying lens.
The room suddenly turned dark and on the glass wall opposite me a vernal meadow appeared.
The earth was covered with a marvellous carpet of flowers, the shrubs were laden with blossom, and all the blooms were without exception white.
The meadow was stirred by a soft breeze, and when this whispered past my face I could enjoy the refreshing spring scent filling my lungs.
And from the shrubs came the song of birds.
However, this great whiteness slowly faded.
The meadow became now yellow, now blue, then changed into an utterly improbable ultramarine and finally turned red.
At the same time men and women dressed in white stepped out of the shrubbery and with slow steps walked across the scene.
Their bodies swayed, their arms swung rhythmically and the throbbing song of the birds, too, was in harmony with this rhythm.
It was something like a dance, but much more simple and natural.
After my considerably depressed feelings it was at any rate a refreshing and interesting sight.
I marvelled at the perfect plasticity of the figures and at the scent, which could not have been produced by any technical equipment in our cinemas.
Besides, to begin with, the spectacle afforded a definite artistic pleasure.
Unfortunately, however, the beautiful creation was spoilt by some blunders that considerably lessened its artistic value and gave the impression of bold dilettantism.
The flowery field divided into parts.
Blue, yellow and red squares drew close to one another and then merged into each other, one colour overcoming the other and the pulse of the birds' songs gradually became so artificial that it disturbed my pleasant mood.
To make matters worse unnatural sounds such as car-siren hooting and the crackling and whistling of instruments broke in upon the song of the birds.
The clothes of the performers changed, too; the light and loose white spring gowns became heavy ones trimmed with fur. Yellow brass belts appeared on them from which shining blue stones hung and finally into the vernal scent other unlikely odours mixed. I could smell mint, ether and even sulphur.
Now - to be frank - I began not to understand the matter.
But I had little time to ponder, as the room became bright, the picture disappeared, the whizzing suction fans extracted the smell, the machine buzzed, and a new paperband emerged which the doctor tore off and scrutinized.
It became dark again.
On the wall the picture of an orange appeared, then another beside it, a third one, a fourth one and so on.
At the same time such a pleasant orange aroma wafted towards me that it made my mouth water and I felt a great desire to eat one.
When, however, quite a heap had already risen, the oranges began to arrange themselves into rows until I was finally faced by one single wall of oranges.
Now the oranges slowly dissolved into each other, the outlines blurred, only their colour remained as if the wall of the room had been painted orange.
At the same time the scent evaporated.
The colour then turned into more and more vivid tones, gained a lacquered shine and finally glittered so brilliantly that none of the paints known to us could possibly compare with it.
With this, however, the room became suddenly bright, the machine buzzed, and ejected a new paper band for the doctor to examine. I sat dazed as I had no idea as to the meaning of this, why they had done it, and what connection there had been between the events shown on the wall.
It became dark again.
On the wall, in the left corner, a man appeared.
In exhaustion he collapsed into a chair and wiped his forehead.
This was repeated in the right corner: a man appeared and sat down.
Now a table set itself in front of each and on the tables appeared food-boxes such as I had seen in the dining hall.
The first man opened his box hastily and voraciously attacked the food but before he could even sink his spoon into it the other stepped up to him, took it from him and threw it away.
This unexpected turn of events astonished me but before I could regain my equilibrium the aggressor was back at his seat and on the table in its turn appeared another box.
The hungry man again fell to, but the aggressor stepped up to him anew and threw away the food.
This outraged me and, indeed, I could only admire the hungry man's patience that the attacker was again able to commit his perfidious deed without reprisal, but this was not yet enough.
The scene repeated itself action by action for the third time!
This unbelievable impudence so infuriated me that I was almost about to leap over and take revenge on behalf of the poor helpless chap.
Although, to tell the truth, I would have most gladly given a piece of my mind to him as well.
Now the fourth appeared on the table.
The hungry man opened it, whereupon the aggressor stood up yet again.
This was already more than enough.
I felt that if he did not slap his face this time, I should burst.
However, the hungry man stood up too.
With my nerves stretched to breaking point I was looking forward to the hard, relieving cuff but this was not what happened.
Instead the hungry man shouted.
"Elo!
Elo!"
At this several people ran to the scene, surrounded the attacker and forced him to sit down in his place.
And now such a thing ensued which could have been termed anything except the solution of such dramatic conflict.
The hungry man opened the aggressor's box, dug his spoon into it, and - made him eat, while the others kept him down!
In the meantime he continuously explained to him but without any emotion in his voice.
When they had compelled him to eat the whole portion, he was helped to his feet, three men led him away, and the hungry man set at last about his own portion and ate it.
With this the room became bright again, and I was filled with the greatest feeling of want.
This story not only lacked dramatic justice but deeply unsettled even my day-to-day sense of justice.
I do not say that the food of the aggressor should have been thrown away as well, for after all food is not to be wasted, but at least some lesson should have been taught him to remove any similar inclination to high-handed actions in the future!
Or, if they considered such a timid public would be horrified by this, they should have turned him over to the police, so that behind prison bars he might have had the opportunity to ponder over the rules of proper conduct.
But to feed him!
From this story, fair play and reassuring justice were entirely absent.
It was not balanced, it was unjust, it was incomplete.
Why?
And why had I, above all, to see all this?
I took the whole business to be some sort of psychotechnological examination. But why should the victim be treated to an episode which lay beyond all logic?
What diagnosis could possibly be established on such a basis?
The doctor, however, pulled the needle from my shoulder blade, tore a new band off the machine, examined it and rang a bell.
Two more of his companions entered, beckoned me to go with them and then, again through corridors, we came to an enormous park and, crossing that, entered a one-storey building.
They led me into a low-ceilinged room where I had to sit down stripped naked on a chair.
Having sat down I was horrified to discover that on its arms were copper sheets, similar to those of an electric chair, and suddenly the suspicion flashed through my mind that I had fallen into the hands of one of my country's enemies.
I saw a formidable metal hood hanging at the end of a cable from the ceiling and a strange hissing could be heard from inside it. My presentiments were confirmed when I realized they wanted to crown me with this.
Screaming I started from the chair and wanted to run out, but two of them jumped on me, held me down, forced me back onto the chair, strapped me to it, fitted the hood onto my head, and fastened it securely.
Beads of sweat appeared on my face; shouting in all kinds of languages I protested, and kicked out, but was unable to battle with such numerical superiority, and, my strength waning, I closed my eyes, committed my soul to God and gave up the struggle.
Now a third man flicked a switch on the wall and I felt my hair standing on end.
At that time I ascribed it to fear but later it turned out to be the result of static electricity.
A low buzz could be heard from the hood, they then removed it from my head and I eventually realized with relief that I was still alive.
They untied my hands and as I touched my head, everything became clear: my hair was cut.
I had the same plain cropped hair-style as they themselves.
The whole haircut had taken scarcely five seconds.
Now I was looking forward with much greater tranquillity to the things to come.
After this my chair began to move; in the next room they fitted another cap on my head.
Soon lukewarm water flooded over my head, a rotating brush washed it, and then, in a few minutes when they took the cap off, my hair was already dry and combed
From here the chair carried me through a pool; then warm air was blown onto me. Finally I passed through a big tube, in which a strange lilac light flickered.
Afterwards they dressed me in brand new clothes, just like those I had received in the town, and finally they led me into a comfortable, clean little room, explained to me that this would be my home, and left me alone.
The furniture of the room, by the way, was exactly the same as I had seen in my guide's home.
This reassured me as I was already afraid that on account of the former regrettable misunderstandings they took me for a madman.
But what was to come?
I had little time to ponder.
A few minutes later a man entered, took hold of my arm and said: "ba".
Then he pointed to my foot: "bola," he said and motioned to me to repeat it.
So, they wanted to teach me their language, which made me very glad.
At last I might hope that the many hitherto unsolved questions would be cleared up.
Next he pointed to himself.
"Zatamon," he said.
I understood.
That was his name.
I shall not bore the Reader with more details.
Suffice to say that I spent the following period studying the language and in a month I could speak to them perfectly.
Their language is of the utmost simplicity.
Their alphabet consists of thirty letters: fifteen vowels and fifteen consonants.
From among the consonants the "r", "q", "x" and "c" are missing, whereas they have more vowels than our language.
Speaking their language is on the whole very comfortable. The more difficult sounds and double letters they do not have; in their words vowels and consonants follow each other alternately.
The characters, too, are completely plain: horizontal, oblique and vertical lines, upright and horizontal ellipses, our letter "v" in four different positions, the circle and deltoid, etc.
In short, each was a geometrical figure, which so characteristically fitted the local pattern.
For numbering, too, they used letters.
Each number had two names: a vowel and a consonant, from which the Reader can already see that they did not use the decimal but the quindenary numerical system.
The names of number one, for instance, are "e" and "l", number twelve "i" and "m", number fourteen "u" and "z".
This abbreviates the numbers in both writing and speech alike, as the numbers, too, are expressed by placing vowels and consonants alternately one after the other.
The number 3331, for example is written in the quindenary system with three figures only: 14-12-1, and they write and call it "zil".
For time divisions they did not use hours and minutes; the day was divided into 50,625 parts (which is the fourth power of fifteen); one such part is somewhat longer than our second.
And what we express by "6 hours 32 minutes 11 seconds in the afternoon", they simply denoted by saying "kalaz", which is the number of time units which have passed since midnight.
Later I learned how easy it was to memorize telephone numbers this way.
Their words are extremely brief, and I had the impression that their language had been compiled artificially as the words used most often were the shortest.
The character of each word can be established by considering its first letter. For example all nouns begin with "b", such as "ba" and "bola" which have already been mentioned.
Personal names commence with "Z", and the attributes with "k", while with initial vowels they indicate verbs.
That the indicator of the character of the word stands in front makes speech more easily comprehensible as the listener's attention is better distributed within the word.
With intonation, too, they express much more than our language.
Different intonations are used by one who advises, addresses, approves or refutes.
Similarly the word order is also very varied, and the meaning of the sentence can be altered by changing the place of one single word.
And all this was very easy to acquire as their language has the strange feature that it has no exceptions.
To give an example, in our parliaments lengthy debates can evolve over questions such as who is to the right in political discussions and who is to the left, who is a nationalist and who is an internationalist, who supports dictatorships and who supports liberalism, and so on.
In their language the dozens of variations in intonation, word order and affixes do not convey such concepts as dictatorship, liberalism, or nationalism, but the intention, the goal.
This is why they do not have expressions for such things, but all the more often I heard the words kazo and kazi.
As the Reader will come across these two words many times, I must discuss them in more detail.
None of them can be translated into any European language..
If they said of an action "it is kazo," this would mean, if we said it, that it was "legal, rightful".
But this is only an approximation.
Let us see what they applied this word to.
Kazo is somewhere between chivalry, impartiality, patience, self-respect and justice.
It means some general rightful intention but cannot be translated by any of these words, as with us a one-shilling tip to the waiter is considered chivalrous, which is not kazo with them, being the overpayment of something.
Nor does impartiality suffice, because with this is mixed the idea of compliance, while the heart has nothing to do with kazo.
It is a strict mathematical conception for the equality of service and counterservice, something similar to the principle of action and reaction in physics.
If someone who does more heavy work also eats more, it is kazo for them.
If somebody eats more because his stomach requires it, then that is also kazo.
And if the invalid who does no work wishes to have finer food, then this, too, is kazo.
It is likewise kazo if somebody finds himself in trouble and the others, putting their work aside, help him, but only as long as is necessary.
I may say it took a lot of my time before I understood this idea.
In order somehow to familiarize my Readers with it, I will endeavour to approach it by this definition:
Kazo is pure reason which perceives in a mathematical straight line and clarity when and how it must act so that the individual, through society, reaches the greatest possible well-being and comfort.
That is, to organize work, rest, sleep, sport, food, and our attitude towards our fellow-men so that we can produce the maximum possible, but without damaging our health with unnecessary strain.
If somebody works less than this, it is not kazo, because what he has omitted to do, somebody else has to do as extra work, which he can do only wearily, to his own detriment.
We must not forget, kazo is not individualistic but communal in sense: what is not kazo for someone else is not kazo for me either.
In kazo is, of course, included the personal faculty, too.
The more talented, the stronger, produces more.
To us this appears to be an injustice, but to them it is as natural as to expect a bigger output with less fuel consumption in the case of a more efficient machine.
It also includes the help given to companions in trouble, as it is not an individual but a general principle.
In case of necessity the work of a whole town would stop to rescue one single man.
And the most wonderful thing is that, as we shall see later, kazo had no kind of emotional character.
In several cases it was even applied to matters that had no connection with the human society.
If, for example hares gnawed round the young trees, this, too, they considered, kazo, but if the mother hare devoured her own leverets it was not kazo.
One would be a remarkable man were one to understand them!
The opposite of this is kazi.
For example, somebody takes new clothes from the store when he could continue to use the old ones.
Or if without pressing necessity, one disturbs the actions of one's fellow-men, for instance, unnecessarily talking to them of things that are of no consequence to either, or, let us say, if one were to announce that in the garden nobody else might sit on a certain deck-chair even though one is not oneself sitting on it.
If someone, for instance, is lying on a couch in the garden, and there is no other place, and another man comes up to him and asks him to yield his place and he is not willing to do so, then it is kazo if the resting person is more tired, otherwise it is kazi.
When, in the course of my studies, I got to this point, I felt as if the whole was somewhat insecure.
I asked Zatamon how they avoided the occurrence of kazi things.
"A kazo man does only kazo things," he answered.
"I think," I said, "you do not understand what I have asked.
How does someone who wants to sit down on a bench know that he is the more tired?"
He looked at me in surprise.
"Well, if he asks for the place of another man, it can only be that he is more tired!"
"But how does he know?"
"Because it is kazo."
I saw we did not understand each other.
"But how can he see into the other?"
"I have already told you," he replied.
"Because the kazo is like that.
There is a species of ants, for instance.
If one of them finds honey, it will take its fill of it.
Now if it meets a companion that has not found honey and is hungry, it will stick its mouth to the other ant's mouth and thus the full ant will transfer honey from itself until each of them is equally satisfied.
How does the full ant know that the other is more hungry, and how do both know when each of them is as satisfied as the other?"
"Well, how do they know?" I asked with eager curiosity as I thought that through their more developed knowledge a secret of nature still unsolved with us would be revealed to me.
"They know because the fuller one gives honey to the hungrier one, and they will be equally satisfied when they part."
The stupid answer astonished me.
It was not at all what I had expected of him.
But however often I asked him, I could not lead him out of this circular chain of thought.
And he always ended with - the kazo is like that.
For this reason I stopped inquiring; I thought I would come to know by myself.
They call themselves Hins, which may perhaps be the equivalent of the word "man" but, as with every word, this, too, is connected with the intention and the aim, as the Reader will presently see.
For if the behaviour of someone does not follow the kazo laws, such a person will not be called Hin.
For this designation, however, they have more than one word, according to whether the person concerned commits kazi things through a lack of knowledge or a lack of goodwill.
The ignorant are called Belohins and the recalcitrant Behins.
The concept of Belohin may perhaps be the equivalent of what we indicate by the word "unschooled".
Here, accordingly, belong children and those who are beginning some new profession.
These are sent to school, but compulsion is scarcely employed - at most, in the first stages of childhood.
It is their conviction that with a sound mind nobody commits kazi things.
It follows from this that their education is radically different from ours.
Whereas with us the main aim of schooling is to bring children up to be virtuous and decent citizens and to make their souls susceptible to fine and noble things, all this is to them an unknown concept, and schooling is no more than a source of physical, chemical, hygienic and technical acquirements.
I asked Zatamon how they could achieve, by teaching purely technical material of knowledge, the avoidance of kazi acts.
To this he replied, "In the possession of technical knowledge and a sound mind it cannot be imagined that somebody would still want to eat an electric lamp."
I retorted, of course, that I had not meant this, but how one's morals could be directed without moral precepts.
To this he replied, "What would be the sense in teaching what we are permitted and what we are forbidden to eat?
It would have several disadvantages. On the one hand it would complicate education as, besides glass, we should have to mention stone, iron, nickel and thousands of other things.
On the other hand it would not be expedient either, as if one hears only the rules, and does not know the essence of the things themselves, one will miss the automatic direction and will never be able to act independently, quite apart from the fact that intellect is a property everyone is born with from which directive education would remove something, while the aim of teaching is not to subtract but to add.
Finally, it is also unnecessary because, as I have said, if a man of sound mind has acquainted himself with reality, he will not eat glass even without prohibition.
Prohibitions are to be explained to a fool only, and to a fool you in any case explain in vain."
I saw he had misunderstood me again, and remarked that I had not spoken of eating glass but of the avoidance of the kazi way of life and acts, but in answer he only kept on repeating:
"This is precisely what I have explained."
I can confirm at any rate that kazo has nothing to do with morals, because kazo itself is not taught either; but it indicates a certain state of knowledge which if once acquired by a man of sound mind will be observed by him anyway.
They did not mention it too often among themselves, as we ourselves do not speak of the alphabet; but as a foreigner I heard it all the more - uninitiated as I was I came up against it at every turn.
The kazo they did not even consider a concept but said that it was the reality of the existing world itself.
On the other hand kazi did not mean immoral, sinful or improper, but something like the word "absurdity" with us, that is, something in contradiction with the physical facts.
I may say, it was quite strange on the whole, especially when I became acquainted with the other rules of the kazo, because, as the Reader will see, the kazo extended beyond the just way of life, to several other matters, too, which I had already deemed unjust and offensive.
After all this, the opinion they formed of the third group, the Behins, namely those who do kazi things though possessing full knowledge of the facts of natural science, becomes understandable.
They consider Behin not only anyone who eats glass, but also anyone who has a tired man stand up, or himself stands up though he is tired to yield his place to somebody who is less tired; further anyone who works more or less than he is able to without strain, anyone who takes someone else's food or gives his own to someone else while he himself is hungrier, etc.
The Reader will certainly have noticed from this that the word Behin comprises two notions.
For someone who takes the food of anyone else is to us an evil-doer and anyone who gives his own unwisely to someone else is a fool.
They, however, expressed both with one word, Behin, without taking into account whether the person concerned has caused harm to himself or to somebody else.
Thus we can see that people were named according to quality in three different ways. These separate words, however, did not signify that they regarded the Behins as a different kind of man.
They did not consider them human beings at all; it was as if they were speaking of a different species of man or animal.
The Behins, by the way, were confined within a separate place, which I know not how to name: possibly a reservation rather like a lunatic asylum.
From there they were not permitted to come into contact with social life.
Fortunately they took me for neither a madman nor a criminal but for a Belohin to be taught.
The Reader is now able to understand also the name of their country: Kazohinia means the country of those who know the pure reality of human existence.
CHAPTER FOUR
Author is let out to town where he experiences very odd things - The Hins do not know money, nevertheless they are rich - Author's debate on money and production - He comes to know their streets, parks, restaurant and library - His fruitless investigation into the past and the morals of the Hins
Thus, as a modest student or, as they termed me, a Belohin, I was, in spite of the medical degree I had obtained in Oxford University, exposed to their assigning me, to my shame, to some elementary school.
I had to admit that their knowledge of the natural sciences was more advanced but as a loyal citizen of my country, I knew full well that there existed not only objective facts but also patriotic duties and took care not to acknowledge this before them so as not to afford them fresh unfounded grounds for their national pride to swell.
So, in order to avoid this slight, I tactfully mentioned my degree to Zatamon which, with all modesty, did evidence some knowledge and education.
I was not, however, able to omit remarking that its being taken for nothing would have meant the deprecation of my nation as well.
Zatamon, however, replied that life was everyone's own private affair; he himself knew best what kind of knowledge he lacked.
My being a Belohin meant no more than that if I asked anything of anybody he would reply.
Thus I came to know that I was not actually confined to the hospital and might go out into the town at any time, and had only to carry a certificate as evidence that I was a Belohin, for otherwise I would not receive answers to all my questions.
This surprised me a little, and put into a still stranger light their politeness which was in any case not by any means overdone.
With regard to this Zatamon only told me that the Behins were in the habit of making unnecessary inquiries, and a too curious man might possibly be mistaken by the Hins for a Behin.
At this I was even more astonished and asked why, but his response reassured me.
"The Behins," he said, "often make the passers-by stop and begin to talk of the most diverse non-existing, that is, kazi things."
Here he took out his notes and read aloud some passages.
"One of the Behins, for example, claimed that the plum was not to be eaten, but should be set aside and contemplated.
When he was asked the reason, he replied, 'Because it is blue.'
Another asserted that the trees talked, a third that people had to suffer because this would assuage hunger, a fourth demanded that people who saw him should put their hands on their stomach, and a fifth put a wire ferrule on his head instead of a cap, and commenced explaining to everybody that this suited him better as he was taller this way."
This finally reassured me.
I saw what he was hinting at and I in turn reassured him that he did not need to fear mental disorder in my case.
He made out the certificate, however, and I decided to go out into the town.
The first surprise of this excursion was that the Hins had no money.
Although on my arrival I had already noticed that my guide of that time did not pay anywhere, I could not imagine that money would be absent altogether.
I realized this as soon as I entered the hospital underground station.
I took it for granted that the railways of such a developed town would accept foreign currency so my eyes immediately sought the booking office.
As I did not see it anywhere I wanted to ask the first Hin, but it was only then that I came to realize that in spite of my having studied thoroughly, I did not know what money and booking office were called in their language.
Interestingly this deficiency had not hitherto struck me.
I knew, however, that my country had always played a prominent role in the dissemination of humanitarianism and culture, the eloquent proof of which is our colonies and the international prevalence of such words as these, so stepping up to the first Hin I said, "Money!
Business!"
To my great amazement he did not understand, upon which, taking my purse out, I showed him some coins and explained in their language that I should like to change it into theirs. He, however, replied that they had nothing like that.
At this I asked him how I could get into the town by tram. He turned without a word and wanted to leave.
I was just about to protest indignantly against such groundless haughtiness, the like of which I had not experienced even in Spain when Zatamon's words came into my mind and, getting out my Belohin certificate, I showed it to him.
The Hin immediately changed and related in detail, almost verbosely, every technical particular of how to get on.
That when the door opened one was to enter, then to sit down, etc.
I told him I was not an idiot but wanted to know whether I was supposed to give such pieces of metal to anybody so that the tram would take me.
He, however, retorted that whoever did not know the technical details of getting on was not necessarily an idiot, but the sanity of anyone who wanted to use metal coins for the starting of a tram when he knew perfectly well that it was operated by electricity was more justifiably to be called into doubt-from which he was prevented solely by my Belohin certificate.
I must say it caused me a lot of difficulty before I realized that they had no idea at all about money.
When the tram arrived and we got on, my first question was how they transacted the turnover of goods.
It came to light that everything took place entirely without money.
The factories turn out goods but nobody receives payment.
The goods, on the other hand, lie in the warehouses for everybody and everybody takes as much as he wishes.
I could not imagine how they were able to maintain order in this chaos.
Let us imagine what would happen if, for instance, our railways were to carry passengers with neither conductor nor ticket - free of charge.
Apart from the inevitable bankruptcy, there would not be the rolling-stock to cope with the increased traffic.
So I asked him whether it sometimes occurred that people travelled about aimlessly and unnecessarily by tram.
"No," said he.
"That would be kazi."
"But, even so without a conductor, it might still easily happen."
Naturally I had to explain what a conductor was, to which he replied that, it would be really kazi if a man were on the tram just to travel about aimlessly and unnecessarily, while the tram could go quite as well without him.
I had to explain anew that the conductor was for preventing aimless and unnecessary travelling about, to which people were otherwise rather inclined.
"But why would a person do that?" he asked.
"Why, everybody has the opportunity to spend his time in a useful occupation."
"Well, let us say instead of going to work, he might go to the mountains where he could sit down and take in the gratifying sight.
I wanted to say beautiful, but they have no word for it, just as there is none for tourism.
"How could it be gratifying," he answered, "if someone with rested muscles sat idly in the forest?
Anyone who does not work will not find resting pleasant either."
"Not to sit down, but say, to go up to the mountain to find gratification in seeing the environment and the flowers."
They have no expression for taking delight in something.
He did not understand, so I related to him that we, had people who did not work but exercised their slack muscles in sport, from which he then drew the conclusion that they performed very heavy intellectual work and announced that for such people they, too, maintained standard gymnasiums and forest resorts.
He by no means understood, however, why somebody who did not carry out even intellectual work did not instead operate a machine or push a barrow when it was much more sensible and interesting since it was useful work, reality, while sport pursued for its own sake was no more than imaginary work, a pale substitute for life in which the unfortunate sportsmen did not participate.
I remarked that it was precisely those whom we call the rich who partake of the pleasures of life, and not the poor, and that rich people did not work.
"And whom do you call rich, and whom poor?"
"These words express the distribution of money.
Those to whom a lot of money has fallen are rich; those who have only a little are poor."
"And on what basis is the money distributed?"
"If somebody has a lot of money, he is rich.
Such a man will establish a factory or establish a business.
Accordingly he earns more money than the poor man whose money is not enough for this."
This he found somewhat confusing, and vaguely demanded some "natural starting point"; and even after a lengthy explanation he understood no more than that some people have a great deal of money and others very little.
Then, after giving the matter due thought, he exclaimed, "But then according to this, money does not exist!"
"Of course it does!" I said in astonishment.
"What does not exist in nature does not exist at all."
I showed him my money in vain; what he saw only confirmed his assertion as, he said, whenever he asked me for money I could show him only paper, gold or silver, but no money.
I had never been fond of flat word-playing and it was only my politeness that prevented me from telling him so.
I thus preferred to ask him how they transacted exchange of goods.
To this he replied that although he did not know why it should be necessary to exchange, say, our coats when his fitted him as well as mine fitted me, but were it nevertheless necessary for some reason, he did not understand even then what money had to do with it.
"Money facilitates the exchange," I said, "and so furthers economic development."
At this he immediately changed, produced a notebook from his pocket and asked me to expound the matter in greater detail because he wished to communicate any useful information to the production factors concerned.
I was delighted to be at his disposal, all the more so as I knew that by acquainting them with our more developed institutions I should enhance the glory of my country.
I related in full detail that money is issued by a central bank in various denominations, from which everybody receives according to his merits, and which is at the same time a licence enabling its owner to take his due share of the fruits of common work.
I spoke about the advantages of money; that it can be exchanged for anything, thus ensuring a free choice of goods; that through money it is possible to convert the countervalue of the articles we sell, at any time in a lump sum or in instalments, to other articles, and so on.
He expressed the view that exchange was possibly not easier if we doubled the work by involving the exchange of money, but, as he said, it was not important either.
He preferred to know in what way money furthered production.
I explained that it made it possible for many people with small resources to join forces and establish a factory by purchasing shares.
"What are they?" he asked.
"Another wonderful invention of the human mind.
Another type of paper, which is given in exchange for money."
"And if the work of exchange is treble what is the factor which facilitates?"
"That these papers enable work to start."
He looked at me in suspicion.
"What would you say," he asked, "if I told you that I can get up from this seat only after handing over a page of my notebook to you?
It has nothing to do with reality, it is a non-existing thing, isn't it?"
I was astonished by this naivety but tried to stifle my laughter.
However, I explained in vain how money sets work in motion. He stubbornly replied that he understood this, but it seemed that we did not understand at all, as according to anyone with any sense, the starting of work had only one prerequisite, the starting of work itself, and not the exchanging of papers, which did not even exist in reality, and which it was a pity to invent.
I asserted that money did exist and an eloquent proof of how true it was had been the world crisis which almost blocked production.
"And why?" he asked.
"Because there was no money."
At which he asked again why we invented such a thing that did not exist.
I reached the end of my patience. In annoyance I became silent, and he did not ask any more questions.
I thought he had taken offence.
But after a minute of silence, in the same emotionless tone, he began to speak.
"And how can you ensure, in spite of the money, that kazi acts do not occur?"
"What do you mean by that?"
"That nobody should take from anyone else what is due to that person."
I was surprised that, in a country where goods were the property of everyone, with everyone taking out of the warehouses as much as he wanted, he could ask such a question. In that chaos how was the individual to know what was due to him?
"In brief with you the mistake is that when a rich man gives money for goods, he feels as if he had brought something into equilibrium, and even when his purchases are well beyond his own, he still thinks that he is buying his own, and that even then he is within the limits of the kazo equilibrium", he explained.
He deeply commiserated with our rich people, for we had so confused their outlook that they could not work, we forced them to eat others' share of bread, whereby production decreased and poverty increased.
I related to him that it was precisely our rich who constituted the most valuable section. It was they who founded and maintained the factories and enterprises by which they gave bread to a lot of poor people.
It was for this very reason that when someone comes to us from abroad we refuse him a work permit lest he should take the bread of others.
While I was speaking he scrutinized my face, and then instead of replying, he asked again for my Belohin certificate.
Musing, he perused it several times, then said that I seemed to have become a little tired of learning for the day and I had had better walk for a few hours in the open.
I vividly protested stating that I was in perfect possession of my senses, and the truth of all this was proved by the fact that in the country with the most developed economy in Europe, all this was tangible reality.
He, however, did not reply.
This superciliousness annoyed me, and only the awareness of my being a guest prevented me from revenging this insult.
So I travelled on in silence. He did not inquire as to my destination, and when we reached the bank of the river I decided on the spur of the moment to get out.
I went into the wide, large park stretching along the riverside which was the epitome of both orderly care and neglect.
Gravel paths, rolled to become as smooth as glass, silvery lamp-posts, here and there a path protected by glass walls sunk into the ground, and many chairs with rubber seats.
I saw, however, neither statues nor fountains.
In their lawns weeds and grass grew together, the trees were only superficially pruned and of ornamental plants I saw no trace.
But I had to admit that the air was excellent, as if I were not in a park in the middle of a big town, but out in a forest.
One small area was surrounded with a low-hung chain.
In the grass inside this area, I saw some sprouting saplings.
Beside the chain was a board with the inscription:
"It is not useful to enter here".
In one section of the park I came to a clearing.
It was only here that I found mown grass.
The clearing was edged in the form of a semi-circle with comfortable couches for sun-bathing, on which, here and there, people were lying or sitting.
I also saw some pieces of gymnastic apparatus and strange electric machines the functions of which were a complete mystery to me.
What provided the greatest interest, however, was the snack bar situated in the centre.
In the wall there were taps supplying cold milk and refreshing drinks, inside there was a refrigerator with paper boxes filled with a variety of solid foods, and in a bin, paper cups.
The Hins came and went, ate and drank, and I saw no sign of attendants.
The Hins lying in negligee on the couches, the unattended snack bar and the whole atmosphere had the same impression of intimacy on me as had the rice-fields after my arrival: as if I had not been in a public place, but at the garden-party of a hospitable aristocrat.
I may say, it was very strange to my European eyes, seeing this society whose every member was rich without having a single penny.
As if the whole society had formed one household within which there were no financial problems, or written regulations, or prohibited areas, or work status problems, but where the members of the family went about freely, helping each other with the housework, and helping themselves from a dish set in the middle of the table.
I felt a warm, friendly and intimate atmosphere which I had never before felt among any people.
And in such a sharp contrast to all this was the complete silence of the Hins.
The new fresh impression of this common property carried even me away, and I drank a fruit juice, but my good manners did not let me impose upon their hospitality.
At my side I felt the polite host who, although he offers food as becomes a gentleman, takes a nevertheless poor view of the greedy guest.
Standing near the snack bar I watched the Hins coming and going.
Some incomprehensible contradiction manifested in the whole scene.
That wonderful provision for people seemed to indicate the highest degree of warm familiar fondness and at the same time everybody was a stranger; not a single greeting was to be heard.
Each simply did not exist for the other.
I should have liked to strike up a conversation with one of them, to ask about this.
Finally I addressed myself to one of them.
"We seem to have fine weather," I said.
He looked at me, stood for a minute, and then without deigning to answer, left.
I may say their manners are expressly insulting.
I had no time, however, to ponder further because at this moment a slight breeze blew and a second later my eye closed painfully.
A speck of dust had got into it, and rub it as I might, it would not come out.
With my head bowed I stood blind, when from the right and from the left two hands grasped my arms.
As far as my stubbornly closing eyelids permitted me to see, two Hins had taken hold of me and began to lead me away.
So much tenderness touched me beyond measure, and in my confusion I stuttered some words of thanks, which was all the more difficult as I did not know such words.
I thought they were leading me to a tap, and was all the more surprised because when they reached the road they stopped, beckoned to the first car, helped me in, and then disappeared without a word, while the car turned and carried me away at high speed.
I had practically no time even to ask where we were going when it had already stopped, the driver helped me out, led me into a house, delivered me to a third Hin, and he, too, disappeared like camphor.
This last took me into a room full of medical instruments, and sat me down on a chair, to which a fourth man came, lifted my eyelid, took out the grain of dust, and said "That's all," and disappeared.
Puzzled I stood alone in the consulting room, and did not know what would happen.
After waiting for about ten minutes I finally grew bored and asked the first man I came across whether I had to do anything more, but, like everybody up to then, he did not answer but told me it was up to me and abandoned me.
At this I left.
Thus I was again on the street and when I reflected on what had happened, the whole procedure seemed like a big automaton which accepts the object dropped into it, one manipulator passing it to the other, the wheels cleaning, polishing, folding and rolling it, and at the end the finished product is ejected, for which, however, neither the object nor the machine is responsible as the whole procedure simply took place.
Walking their streets I was able to make a thorough inspection of their equipment.
Every fifty paces I saw a public telephone in a booth built into the wall of the house, which of course also operated free of charge.
I saw a lot of stores with inscriptions announcing their wares, and inside every kind of article from toothpaste to a dynamo was piled up in the neatest order, and everybody took whatever and as much as he wanted.
I saw a post office, but only parcels were brought for despatch.
And the parcels were not only not registered; most of them were not even wrapped either.
From a complicated microscope, for example, dangled a mere slip of paper bearing the address.
The Hin set this down on a long table and went away.
Apart from those despatching parcels there was not a single soul to be seen in the room.
At the back of the room there were two doors with the inscription: "Sorting Room".
And another panel beneath: "Intellectual work in progress".
With us the expression would have been "No admittance".
After observing for ten minutes I saw the table as it moved off and disappeared through the door of the Sorting Room, while from the other end of the room a similar table came out empty.
This much is certain: there was no queue; but it was beyond me how it was possible to transact such a turnover exactly and safely without the control of records and receipts.
Though it is rather difficult to make them speak, I felt encouraged by their earlier accommodating attitude and asked someone who came to send a parcel.
He answered that if for every parcel a note had been made in a book, it would not help but merely impede the flow of traffic.
I asked him whether it did not sometimes occur as a result of such a happy-go-lucky handling that some of the parcels disappeared into thin air.
To this he replied that according to a long established physical thesis, no material could be lost within nature.
Then again I had the feeling that he, too, was speaking of something different, but later I was forced to realize that they simply did not know of stealing, which evoked my sincere admiration.
This untaught morality thus appeared even more mysterious to me, for the maintenance of which technical knowledge in itself could by no means suffice.
There had to be something behind it. But what was it? And how should I come to know it?
Then I asked where they handed in letters and telegrams. It turned out that every flat and enterprise had its own despatch shoot line into which the letters were dropped to be carried to the centre, which in turn passed them on to the addressees.
He remarked that this was a somewhat awkward method of correspondence (to me it seemed wonderfully easy) but the following year new despatch-shoot boxes with guiding mechanism were to be put into operation.
Once it was properly set the box would find the addressee's line by itself.
There was, however, scarcely any correspondence, messages being mainly dealt with by telephone.
If there was no reply from the dialled number, that did not matter either as the telephone-set received and recorded the message so that it could be listened to at any time.
Now, however, the rumbling of my stomach warned me that it was lunch-time, so turning in to the first restaurant I sat down at a table and took my lunch from the endless belt.
Soon someone else settled down opposite me, and I was meditating upon what people actually did here, if there were no attendants here either.
The absence of waiters was already a familiar fact to me, but now a new problem arose.
How could economic catastrophe be avoided in a place where people were displaced everywhere by machines.
It occurred to me how many troubles my country had in finding work for the unemployed, how many posts were maintained for purely social reasons, and the operation of how many machines had to be forbidden to ensure the livelihood of the employees.
With us how many people earn their living by participating in the work of the nation as waiters, conductors, post office clerks, book-keepers, gate-keepers, cashiers, policemen, clergymen, warders or soldiers.
How beneficial is the existence of all these institutions, and what would happen if all these posts were abolished and the millions of people dismissed and deprived of their livelihood?
Why, in industry unemployment figures are sadly high even so.
Addressing my table companion, I mentioned all this but he replied that it was not worth wasting time with idle chatter.
It is interesting how variable their willingness to help was.
I came to realize only slowly that if I asked about their institutions they went as far as possible to explain everything. If, however, I broached an individual thought, or mentioned our home institutions, they did not even deign to answer.
The problem, however, occupied my mind, and, producing my Belohin certificate, I managed to get my table companion to speak.
I asked him how it was possible for so many people to make a living: solely from productive occupations.
He was very surprised at my question, and believed only after I had thrice repeated it that that was indeed what I had asked.
"I still do not understand," he said, "what there is to be asked about it.
If fewer of us were engaged in production obviously we would be able to produce less and would therefore live less well."
"But do the machines not squeeze men out of the factories?"
"We always leave enough space for people to walk comfortably between the machines."
"That is not what I mean.
A machine does the work of many people, whereby a lot of workers become redundant, and a major part of the goods produced will be superfluous."
"Machines are made precisely so that we can produce more.
How can it be imagined that clothes are made if not for putting them on?"
"But how is it possible for such an enormous number of people to work in the industry?"
This again he did not understand.
"Every man works as much as he can," he replied.
"The more they work, the more they produce.
What is there to restrict the working force?"
"Over-production!
Does the danger of over-production not threaten you?"
He asked what it was, and I in turn explained to him the world crisis, the bank failures, the reductions which come in their wake, the goods surplus and general poverty.
I had to say it over and over again because he did not comprehend a single word of it.
When he finally understood, he said that I must have observed things inaccurately in my country as my description was rather imperfect and there was no connection between the phenomena mentioned.
"For how could the existence of a society be imagined," he said, "where suffocation would be cured by the deprivation of air?
To say nothing of the fact that unnecessarily complicating simple things would show facts in a false light; and any man in his senses would endeavour rather to become acquainted with things as they are than to blur them."
I vividly protested against his mentioning my country in such an offensive manner, but instead of replying, he again asked for my Belohin certificate. Musing, he perused it several times, and then said I seemed to have become a little tired of learning for the day and I had better walk for a few hours in the open.
But I did not give in; I protested against this contemptuous tone; I demanded that he should provide me with the necessary information; after all to my knowledge everyone is at the disposal of a Belohin.
At my taking a strong line he appeared to be ready for further conversation suggesting only that in my own interests we should speak about less difficult topics.
However, I felt hurt by this disdain and waspishly remarked that the things I had spoken about and had seemed so incomprehensible to him were well known to any street cleaner in my country.
With this observation I reverted to our former subject.
To me it seemed impossible that the population could find occupation in industry with such a degree of mechanization, when so many other posts were absent, so I thought that they worked for export.
But when I asked him about this, it came to light that they knew nothing of shipping either. He said that nothing was grown on the sea, so why should they go there?
I mentioned to him how foreign trade boosted the standard of living and how useful it would be if they were to export butter, corn, honey and other things to my country, whereby they could accumulate a considerable reserve of foreign exchange.
To this I received the surprising comment that they would get no satisfaction from food eaten by others!
It was beyond my comprehension how they had not yet died of starvation with such a lack of any economic faculty.
But with this I saw that any further debate would be in vain as some enormous gap yawned between us, and that the Hins' soul had a kind of secret which, unless it were explained, made it impossible for me to make myself understood.
So I got up and left.
I racked my brain for a long time as to how I could come to know them without having to converse with them.
Here, I might ask anything of anybody, each of them gave strange and odd replies, but each miraculously similar to the other.
Personality they scarcely had at all.
And it was for this very reason that I was eager to know what kind of spirit it was that kept them in such a wonderful discipline as could not be imagined with us even in the army.
Finally I came to the decision that I would read.
It was some ethnographic work I had in mind so that I might gain more information relating to their customs and nature.
I stopped the first Hin and asked him where I could get a book about the nature, clothing and general way of life of people here.
I wanted to express the idea of ethnography by this circumscription.
He said that I had mentioned too many subjects at one time, some belonging to anatomy and the functioning of organs, and others to the textile industry.
I saw he did not understand me either, so I asked him only where I could find a library in the neighbourhood.
He was willing to be at my disposal, and told me the address, but I could not make much of it.
When he learned that I was a stranger in the town, he immediately joined me. We took a tram and he took me to the library.
We arrived in a huge, round church-like room the wall of which, to a height of about thirty yards, was one single mass of shelves with millions of books.
In front of the shelves, at different heights tiny balconies hung, with a chair and a little table on each.
In most of them there was a Hin reading and soon I noticed that these small balconies also moved.
The Hins led them along on the horizontal and vertical rails between the shelves to reach the book required.
It was interesting that I had the impression there was a great deal of noise in their library, albeit it was only the turning over the pages that could be heard, and it was not a bit noisier than our own libraries. All of their public life, however, was so silent that I was surprised that this was not even more silent.
Here and there between the shelves were inscriptions in big characters indicating the subjects: "Ethyl ether", "Cellulose", "Protein", and elsewhere "Neurology", "Stomach transplantation", "Transformation of elements", "Grain automatons" or "Depth scrutinizers".
I thought my guide had indeed misunderstood me and had taken me to the specialist library for doctors and technicians, whereas I wanted to learn about the Hins and especially their customs.
Fortunately, I noticed a table in the middle of the room with the inscription "Information" above it.
I stepped up to the Hin who was sitting at it, and repeated my question. Word for word he, too, gave me the same reply as my guide.
I saw that I would not achieve my goal this way, and that perhaps I ought to start with another kind of theme through which I might acquaint myself with their life.
I decided to study their history and said that I was looking for a book dealing with the past.
The Hin answered that this was a very broad subject.
There were books dealing with geology, with the development of races, the nervous system, the intestinal canal and many other things.
I told him that was not the sort of book I was after, but something about the past of people.
I had to repeat my request, but still he did not understand and asked me if I could mention a book about some similar subject.
At this, producing my Belohin certificate, I had to reveal that I was a foreigner and told him I was not in a position to know their literature and could only mention the books of my own country.
At random I mentioned the books on the history of my country by Froude and by Green, but he asked me to say something about their contents as well.
I spoke of the age of Henry VIII; of his marriage with Anne Boleyn; of the fights around the Reformation; the revolt of the Northern Shires, of the execution of Sir Thomas More, the Bishop of Rochester, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, the battles between the various Kings, Parliament, the Duke of Norfolk and Oliver Cromwell, the transubstantiation debates, celibacy, mass and confession...
Of course the whole history seemed unbelievable to him, but I had already grown accustomed to his asking at every sentence, "But why did they do all this?"
When I finished, however, he was surprised at my speaking about the past as if it were something which existed, and in the end it turned out that all this did not exist.
"But it did!" I replied.
"That is possible, but this word in itself implies that it no longer does.
What is the sense in dealing with imaginary things?
It is only the present that is, and if into the bargain you deal with non-existent things, why do you spend so much unnecessary work precisely on the past?
In the same way you could also make maps of non-existent planets."
I observed that many valuable conclusions could be drawn from the past as to how we should direct our actions.
"It is something like taking a laxative on an empty stomach in the morning," he replied, "because we overate in our dream."
Thus it came to light that they had no history at all.
Everybody remembers only the period through which he lived.
And from the forefathers all that remains for the descendants is what they themselves created: a new chemical procedure, a building, a machine. But as to the maker, builder or inventor, nobody knows anything.
In brief, I was again faced with deadlock.
That they had no belles-lettres I already understood.
I racked my brain to find what I could study which might cast light on their life and outlook.
I asked for philosophical works but once more he asked what that was.
When I spoke of human thinking and its rules, he referred me to neurology without hesitation, from which it became evident that they had no philosophy either.
At this I was sincerely astonished as the whole of their life consisted of varying the concepts of kazo and kazi, from which any sober mind would have concluded that it was a nation of philosophers.
I also asked him why they did not write a single line on even the main problem of their life.
I mentioned how many authors, and from how many angles, had tried to interpret morality, the laws of God, and justice.
"What exists," he replied, "needs no explanation.
What sense would there be in explaining, for example, that the circle is round?
And if a figure is described once as round and then as square, it is possible only if this figure does not exist, because if it does exist it is either one or the other."
I was already profoundly bored by these fruitless debates.
For this reason I thought it better to look for a book on economy; the Hin, however, asked me in which of the branches of manufacture I was interested.
I enlightened him as to my wish to be informed of the system of production, but again he said that it was different with every article.
Wheat was grown according to one system, rye differently, and textiles were woven by yet another method.
Shortly it became clear that this did not exist either.
They simply had no economic system, no administration, no religion, no literature!
I was stupefied and could not grasp where I was to find their life.
I should not have been a bit surprised if it had turned out that they themselves did not exist.
Finally I resolved to have a look at their books on neurology, hoping that from their most frequent neurotic symptoms I should be able to draw conclusions as to their inner life.
So I got myself into a balcony and after the Hin director had briefed me concerning the operation of the buttons, I rose to a height of about three storeys and began to search.
Of the titles of the books, however, I could not make out too much.
Finally, taking out one at random, I looked into it.
The title of the first chapter was: "Electron Currents and the Pattern of Thinking".
I scarcely understood even the title, to say nothing of the text.
It spoke of cells, of the forces occurring in them, and then came flexible collision and oscillation calculations and microscopic enlargements magnified fifty million times, but as to what they represented I had not the slightest idea; an endless series of chemical constructional formulae, and mathematical deductions.
Turning over the pages I came to another chapter: "Brain Technology and Nerve Assembly".
I saw photographs of strange measuring instruments, people with small metal boxes on their chest or head, tweezers, scalpels, nerves extracted and transplanted, and then followed some strange pages made of metal, which were girdled all over with little squares so close together that it was injurious to the eye, and the whole vibrated in a dirty grey colour.
At the bottom was written a word unfamiliar to me: "Bomeli".
I was compelled to go down and turn to the Hin at the information desk.
He came to my table, turned up its right flap and a piece of apparatus like a microphotographic instrument emerged.
Opening the book at the page in question he inserted it into the device and I had to look into it through a lens.
In a glass vessel I saw a human brain into which innumerable pins were stuck.
From the left a violet ray projected a violet spot on it.
All around there were countless instruments with indicators.
Now the information librarian pushed a button and the pointers began to move, the brain slowly became a reddish colour, then a human hand reached into the picture, poured the contents of a bottle into the glass vessel, whereupon the brain regained its natural colour and the pointers sprang back to zero.
Of course I did not understand a single thing of all this, and above all I found nothing in the book to give any indication as to the nature of their inner life.
And it was in vain that I told the librarian I wished to know something of their range of emotions and thoughts; his response to this was that we feel and think with our brain, and that all the mathematical formulas concerning both the birth and the interconnection of thoughts were fully dealt with in the first chapter.
I felt indeed as if I were in a vacuum.
I saw that the bridge that could connect us was burnt, and I was not even able to explain what I wanted.
For some time I searched for the expression, but they had no word for the soul, and had I mentioned the heart, I would most certainly have been referred to the shelf with the heading "Circulation".
After racking my brain for a few minutes I gave up all hope and turned my back upon them.
When I got out I walked to and fro for a while, thinking.
I approached a Hin and enquired after art galleries.
He said that there were pictures in every book, and it depended on what I was interested in.
I told him that I was looking for painted pictures, but seeing that he, too, was about to abandon me, I hastened to produce my Belohin certificate.
I had to explain what a painted picture was like.
Once he understood me he said it seemed we did not know its more perfected form, photography.
It was in vain I repeatedly asserted that painting was the more perfect as it portrayed not the surface but the core of things, to which he replied that even in this respect photographs were still more perfect, and I realized from his words that he was speaking of X-rays.
He spoke further of some machine that saw into the depths of the earth, as well as of other strange pieces of apparatus which revealed the inner structure of matter to human eyes.
At this point we found it very difficult to understand each other.
I wanted to express that things had an emotional essence, the impression they made on us. He, however, observed that things would appear to us either as they are, and in this case photography was the more perfect form, or a different image of them evolved in us, in which case the fault was not in the things but in us.
I tried to describe to him individual painters' different impressions, which did not falsify things but wanted to get closer to them, but he maintained his opinion that the essence of something could not be various, and if more than one conception of it evolved, then all of them, except one, would obviously be wrong.
He recommended me to take any object the essence of which was doubtful to any of the chemical or physical institutes where I would receive an exact analysis of them.
With a weary wave of my hand I stated that I needed no more information, at which he left.
But the problem of discovering their secret had become still more exciting as a result of all this.
Before my very eyes there was a marvellous mechanism the cog-wheels of which fitted into each other and performed their work to such a degree of precision as could not be expressed in human terms.
And search for it as I might, I was unable to discover the main spring which kept the whole working.
I stood there like Kepler or Pasteur, who, as they came to know the Laws, became more and more convinced of the existence of the Creator, who, however, withdrew farther and farther from the senses.
His voice faded away in the Burning Bush, his eye did not flash in the storm, his voice did not thunder in the clouds, and the more certain his being became for us, the more distant the mists he withdrew behind.
My brain was feverishly throbbing, so by now those who had recommended me to rest were indeed right.
The day's learning had heaped so many problems onto me that I had inevitably to sleep on them.
I asked the first Hin to show me where the overhead railway was; he willingly led me to it, and I got in.
On the way home, nevertheless I made a rough list of the questions and decided to consult Zatamon on all of them.
After all he was a neurologist who dealt with the psyche, and he also knew me more closely.
CHAPTER FIVE
Author becomes acquainted with some of the secrets of the Hins - In this chapter we come to know that the Hins have no kind of constitutional form - Zatamon's strange opinions concerning the administration of justice, love, the soul, and literature - Author's difficult game of chess with his tutor - A confused explanation about the kazo
By now Zatamon did not bother too much with me.
I had acquired the language and the fundamental ideas of Hin life and as far as the rest was concerned I was more or less left to my own devices.
The next day he did not even call upon me, which was all the better since I was thus able to organize my thoughts more appropriately.
I took it for granted that a very democratic, parliamentary government ruled the island.
At least thus far whenever I enquired about any procedure I was told that it was my own concern, and it was up to me to decide upon what steps to take.
Here a strange mixture of freedom and discipline ruled between which the relationship was, for the time being, an enigma to me.
It was for this reason that I enquired first of all concerning their form of government.
But when I enquired, I had first to narrate what we meant by constitutional form, democracy, dictatorship and parliamentarianism, and what elections, appointment, etc. were.
With enthusiastic eloquence I spoke highly of my country's ancient parliamentary and democratic government which always ensured the right of the people to have a say in the running of their own lives.
When I got to this point Zatamon asked me why it was necessary to have a say in the running of life, when life existed so that it should run and not so that people should interfere with it.
"In order," I replied, "that we should be able to ensure freedom."
This I could express only in a roundabout way; I spoke to him about general human rights and equilibrium, but he replied that freedom could not be as I had described it because as soon as there was intervention in it, it was no longer freedom.
And no country could have much to do with reality where equilibrium is expressed with such an emotional, which is non-existent, word like freedom.
To cast some light on the concept of equilibrium as we understood it, I mentioned, as its most brilliant example, the administration of justice which, through the rightful punishment of crimes, restored the disturbed equilibrium and ensured a peaceful, quiet life.
And this was where I was to have a veritable surprise.
In no way could he understand the difference between crime and punishment.
Even after my lengthy explanations he seemed able to appreciate a difference between them only in sequence, and could not see why we had made two different words for two identical concepts which differed only in their order in time in so far as crime came first and punishment followed; but it could also be the other way round: the judges might first commit kazi things, and then the criminals would gain the right to "restore the equilibrium" by perpetrating other kazi things.
"As I see it," he continued, "you believe that the kazo comes about by committing not one but two kazi things at the same time, whereas the doubling of the kazi will - according to any sober thinking - only aggravate its kazi character."
It was no use my telling him that the judge punished only through necessity and with a kazo intention, in the interests of public law and order, so as to diminish the number of criminal cases. He replied that criminals were people just as much as the judges that is they, too, were part of us.
"Or what would you say," he asked, "if it turned out that sparrows had a habit of mutually ravaging each other's nests?
Would you accept the plea that all this is not done by sparrows because whichever ravages later does it after the first?
And finally how would you accept that mutual ravaging is the means of ensuring peace, quiet and equilibrium?"
In the end he summed up his opinion as follows:
"It is not enough that you commit crimes, you even punish as well."
This was how I came to know that they had no kind of government.
It was not only rule they did not know; they did not know parliament either.
"Only sick brains," he said, "need to debate their own affairs.
Anyone in his right senses knows what he needs; he goes to the storehouse and takes it; if the stocks are running out the factories come to know it and replenish them.
What is there to be debated in this?"
So they had no legislature, nor consequently any laws, and as to the administration of justice, they had no idea of it.
Everything went its own way.
I could not imagine how it was possible to live without governing bodies, and he in turn wondered how we could live in such uncertainty when a lot of people who-as he said - had nothing to do with production, continuously interfered and disturbed the work.
Now I proceeded to the second part of the problem, the great mystery, the question of discipline without law.
I asked him:
"Tell me, doesn't any difficulty arise as a result of the absence of all forms of control?"
"What kind of difficulty do you mean?"
"If, for example, a resourceful, smart and bright man realizes that if he works less and eats more it will be of greater use to him."
He replied almost angrily.
(That is if they had any familiarity with anger at all.)
"How could it be of greater use?
If we thought in this way production would not increase but decrease, and so, on the contrary, we would be able to eat less, which is not in the least useful.
But why do you label smart and brainy precisely those feeble-minded people who don't know such simple form of mathematics?"
I felt a deep respect for the country where integrity and unselfishness were such innate properties of the citizens.
I wanted to tell him, but there was no word for this either.
I wondered how a state could be so honest when they did not even have a word for it.
I could only say, in English, that it seemed that here everybody was honest and good-hearted towards others.
Of course, I had to explain the words and when, with great difficulty, he understood, he voiced the opinion that in my country probably the opposite of such people occurred if we created a separate word for someone who was able to interpret mathematics properly.
I gazed at him in astonishment.
Integrity was ensured not only by a complete lack of laws they did not even know what it was.
The cog-wheels fitted into each other perfectly, there was no hitch, there was not a single squeaky bearing in the social machinery, and all this was kept in equilibrium solely by the strength of the common soul!
I should have liked to ask him about psychological motives, but remembering my failure in the library, I was forced suddenly to realize that they had no idea of the soul either, of the very thing which seemed to shine more brilliantly in this very place than anywhere in the world.
But where had all this come from, and what was it that maintained it in them?
Falteringly, in a voice choking with emotion, I confessed my admiration to him.
I frankly admitted that all this was beyond me.
I related to him what a comprehensive and circumspect establishment ensured the smooth running of society in my country; that law, money and jurisdiction controlled the turnover of goods, and in addition, the long years that children were schooled in morality, goodness and honesty - while so far as they were concerned here, it was purely and simply the soul, the common spirit that held together the whole, and what was more, even more perfectly.
I was carried away by a veritable rhetorical passion while I explained that I was still unable to see the common source of all this: in what way and from whom did the soul come, and what imbued them with this miracle?
He asked me to explain the concept of soul in more detail.
I answered that it was the soul that enabled one to do good.
I mentioned as an example that we also had hospitals and homes for the aged.
"And," I asked, "what do you think it is that makes us build them?
Well, that's the soul."
"The hospitals are built by the mason, with machines and concrete," he answered.
"What has the soul to do with that?"
My first reaction was to be annoyed at his lack of comprehension, but then a clinical case of mine came into my mind: we had removed a cataract from the eyes of a six-year-old little boy, blind from birth, but even weeks later he was not able to identify figures.
He saw his mother, but came to know where she stood only by hearing her voice.
In the brain of the child the connection was missing between the concept and the image itself.
He had to learn to see for some months before he had by practice established the connections.
Then I thought I understood everything.
These people were brought up among cold realities so they did not perceive the soul in the same way as we did, I might say, with other senses, and not with their brain, as this comprehended tangible things only.
So my task was the same as in the case of the little boy who had been given back his sight: I had to put him on the right track which would enable him to make the connection between the facts and the soul.
He was bound to have some notion of it already as the kazo was the consummate soul, only he did not recognize it.
I evolved a really strong line of attack, and asked him:
"And why do you build hospitals?"
"Because there are sick and aged persons.
Why else would we build them?
Why do your sick people go to hospital?"
I did not understand the point of this question.
"Because they want to regain their health."
"Then how can you ask why we build hospitals?
In order that the sick may regain their health."
This cheap aphorism, of course, did not throw me off balance and I was determined not to let him slip out of my hands.
"This itself is the pure aim," I replied, "but not the reason.
It is the soul that enables us to help our fellow-men, the connection that fills the gap between the fact of illness and the actual building.
To give an example, it is like the mortar between bricks without which the wall would fall apart.
So this is what induces us to help.
Now do you understand what I am looking for?"
"I understand even less.
Why should there be any gap here?
If between illness and building there is no direct connection and instead an alien concept is wedged in, this does not connect but disconnects them, just as mortar, too, is a heterogeneous insulating layer between the bricks; and the fact that something needs an adhesive only goes to prove its being in a state of disintegration.
Concrete needs no adhesive as it is in itself one material; that is why it is superior."
"Oh, soul is not an alien matter; it is the content of our whole life!
Why would the sick man want to recover if his life had no spiritual aim?
And it is not in the cold concrete of the hospital that the essence of helping lies but in this.
Forceps, medicines and bandages are not enough; most important is the spirit of helping, which has greater healing power than that.
Why should we live without substance?
What would be the sense in recovering and getting back into life if we were not tied to our fellow-men by the thousand threads of friendship, love, interest and faith, if our life was not warmed by all these emanations of the soul, thus making it desirable for the sick man to recover?"
Of course, I had to circumscribe everything. The interconnecting spiritual ties, for example, I compared to a magnet's lines of force.
After my lengthy explanation he finally replied.
"Our body consists of atoms, they determine our desires, because they are the natural world.
And nothing else can be imagined as nothing else exists.
Of the concepts that you compared to a magnet's lines of force, my more exact questions made it quite clear step by step that they are neither magnetic, nor atomic, nor even vibrations, and consequently they are non-existent.
And what does not exist, is not."
How horrifying was this cold way of thinking, the chilling atmosphere of which numbed me.
He asked me, however, to continue my narration because - as he said - he believed that nevertheless there was something real behind my words, and I was merely unable to express it.
Thus, instead of carrying on a fruitless debate with him concerning principles, I began to speak about my country.
I told him how much a true friend was worth, one on whom we could rely in trouble and when we needed protection from the wrath of our enemies.
How our life was sweetened by friendship, a loving wife or a warm domestic circle.
What happiness it was to sit around the fire with our loved ones on winter evenings; to buy gifts for them at Christmas or when celebrating our birthday to invite our friends, in the circle of whom a witty conversation may start about the theatre, art, less significant events, and how beautiful life may be made by a supper taken happily among such friends.
One by one friend, hatred, wife, happiness, theatre, art and party had, of course, to be explained.
I was pleased to see that Zatamon listened very attentively to my words, and made notes while I was talking.
I was already on the verge of hope, but in the end he said he seemed to have discovered some contradiction in my words.
"I thought," he said, "I might learn from you since you spoke of some act of help in unison which seemed to show proper mathematical comprehension, but I was disappointed.
In your country the kazo is considered to apply to certain groups only, which however, already means that it is not kazo as you do not observe it where others are concerned.
Because if you imagine some persons closer to yourselves and favour them, this can only be done if at the same time you offer less or nothing to others.
That is, both the things you give your friends and those you do not give others bear all the marks of the kazi concept.
These friends do not receive out of need, or on the basis of a general state of equilibrium - at least this is what I gather from your words - but purely because you have invented the kazi idea of 'friendship'.
"And as for the word 'love' it seems to me you wish to indicate with this that people outside an exclusive circle are to be treated beneath the merit of their existence. But why do you call the same thing hatred on other occasions?"
I was astounded at his incomprehension and began to explain the difference, but he insisted that anything beyond equilibrium and reciprocality was kazi and there was no sense in dividing it into two separate words.
And if we also assigned different meanings to them, it only proved that our vision was confused.
"Or," he said, "why should a wife or a lover be valued above the merit of her existence when every woman has the same organs; and as far as I can see, you also make a distinction among children, according to whether or not they originate from yourselves; whereas those children who came from the seed of others also exist.
You, however, call the former your own-although every person belongs solely to himself, as his life was born to him and not to the father.
And for those children you buy gifts at Christmas, but for the others, nothing.
You make it appear to the child as if you were giving it beyond the limits of equality and reciprocality, and on top of all this, you hold this activity of yours up to the child as something especially right, which is doubly kazi.
For the child's own part of all goods is due to him as is the case with anyone else, and it is wrong to have it seem as if he received it from us, and without reciprocality."
Christmas he considered especially improper, drawing the conclusion that on the other days we were to hate our fellowmen more.
My explaining that Christmas had been created not for hatred but for love was all in vain; he clung firmly to his opinion that love supposed hatred, as light shadow, and a word could be created for this only where its opposite also existed, and the fact that we loved somebody implied that we had to behave more harmfully towards others, so love itself was kazi, entailing contrast, contention, trouble, starvation, decay, an overwhelming accumulation of kazi things, thus producing a decrease in production and welfare.
He thought there must be a great many Behins with us, who, though aware of the impropriety of it still endeavour to eat more, work less and get others to do the work, because they were imbued with the poison of love.
One special thing he did not understand was why we described as more useful precisely that particular situation in which we could have more food and less work, while it is a general balance that our organs needed, and overburdening was equally harmful whether the strain was on the stomach or the muscles.
I saw he would never understand the essence of love in this way, so I mentioned that we Europeans all followed the tenets of a great common prophet who had announced two thousand years ago that we had to love all our fellow-men equally, that is that love did not encompass only small groups but the whole of mankind.
I related to him how beautiful and enjoyable our life was made by following this; the faith that beautified our soul and filled it with pleasure brought comfort to us, and sheltered us against trials and tribulations, and how elevating it was to be aware of the infinite mercy which provided the soul with a point of support.
"Would it not have been simpler to make life secure in advance?" he asked.
"I don't see what that question has to do with it."
"To make it secure, calculable."
"But why?"
"So that one should not be compelled to flee from uncertainty to uncertainty.
Confused and inexpedient causes can only lead to confused and inexpedient effects."
For this, of course, I was none the wiser.
I retorted that his reply was much more confused than our life, which had been provided with a firm basis by the law of love applying to everybody and connecting the whole of mankind.
At this he observed that what I was saying now was in complete contradiction to what I had said before concerning love. He, however, was convinced that of the two statements it was the former which tallied with the facts, because if love did indeed encompass the whole of mankind it could no longer be called love, in the same way as if the whole surface of the earth were to rise to the level of its highest peak, nobody would say of the earth that all its points were peaks - we would call it a plain and would not even have a word for peak.
He supposed, however, that this prophet might still have been a Hin in whom the state of the kazo was present, and it was merely that we had not understood the mathematical facts he had spoken about, probably because we had a soul to hinder understanding; so, instead of learning from his words and being reborn into the kazo condition, we had been looking for "solace", "beauty", "pleasure" in his words.
Obviously we would never possess life in this way.
I protested vigorously against this.
I told him that the essence of a man was not, after all, his hands, feet or stomach but his "self".
And the soul was nurtured by beauty and variety, which it required no less than the stomach requires food.
This he declared to be completely beyond comprehension, and asked me to explain what this beauty was by which the soul was nurtured, and what the soul actually was, which needed only things which were of no necessity to man himself, and yet I was saying that the soul was man himself.
Because - as he said - I had hitherto only mentioned it as the connecting material between actions but now he saw that it was not only a partition wedged in between the facts of the natural world - somehow it also existed independently, and it must be something very confused.
It behaved like a living organism, I claimed that it took nourishment, and still I could not describe its form.
I could not help smiling at his words.
An old patient of mine came into my mind.
He had gone into the Navy as an uneducated docker.
The poor devil was a complete blockhead, and his training gave his superiors a lot of trouble.
I myself attended him when he was under treatment; I spoke to him a lot of the glorious calling of the British Navy, the past of the United Kingdom and the sweet nourishment our souls could draw from our traditions.
When finally I asked him if he was aware of what tradition was, he answered:
"Perhaps it's some sort of pudding."
Now I was faced with a similar task with Zatamon.
To illuminate soul and beauty better I mentioned the most distinguished works from our literature: "Hamlet" by Shakespeare, "Anna Karenina" and "The Kreutzer Sonata" by Tolstoy, "The Ironmaster" by Ohnet, "La Dame aux camlias" by Dumas, "Peer Gynt" by Ibsen, and in general the classic works which explored the depths of the human mind, bringing to the surface and revealing the secret motives of the passions and emotions broiling below, uncovering the enigmas of the mysterious ego in precise analysis; the maladjustments and subconscious inhibition which sometimes separated even the purest souls from each other or which drove one to discord and catastrophe, even - as in the case of Raskolnikov - to murder and martyrdom, but which at the same time also made one resigned to the enemy, and even to death.
I stressed how profound and perfect the analysis of the character of an Anna Karenina was in its thousands of variations and what an experience it was to see and recognize one's own soul in the struggle where Dr. Faustus or Peer Gynt fought with themselves.
Attentively he heard me out and when I had finished he answered that we appeared to perish in tangles created by ourselves because instead of seeing things in their clear reality and living simply, we preferred to wander intoxicated in a maze of illusory problems which were all entangled with each other.
He gave expression to the opinion that the soul must be some terrible disease confusing everything and preventing the kazo equilibrium from developing.
He did not understand why it was necessary to keep on analysing the soul in thick tomes instead of recognizing the uselessness of this confused and troublesome thing, and discarding it as valueless and looking for something else which it was possible to use.
"Here, too," he said, "it sometimes happens that the production of methylated spirit, sulphuric acid or cellulose does not come off.
All this can be done badly in hundreds and hundreds of ways; but we would consider anyone mad who devoted his life to describing what bad cellulose is like, by how many methods we can obtain bad cellulose, in how many ways the cellulose may become spoiled, and for how many purposes it is unsuitable.
Our books describe the characteristics only of good cellulose and contain information concerning the manufacture of that alone, of which, however, not a word is written in your literature.
But first of all I don't understand why you call it creative work when somebody - withdrawing his labour from creative work - wastes his life on the fruitless analysis of bad and useless things."
I protested in vain against his calling our works of art bad and useless. I realized that for them only pudding is nourishment. So I decided to reply only to the question of why books are written at all.
I told him they were written for entertainment, which was a pleasure and was consequently necessary for people.
As to the question of what entertainment was I mentioned reading, games and chatting.
Of course he also classified these as kazi.
"Is even conversation kazi with you?" I asked in surprise.
"Not necessary conversation.
But as far as I can see, you speak of conversation carried on for its own sake, which is unnecessary conversation, which for this very reason cannot be so agreeable as creative work."
"But during the hours after creative work!"
"At such times, rest is necessary.
Or what would you think of the man who had already reached his destination, sat down in exhaustion and continued to move his legs at the normal pace of walking?
The life of anyone who enjoys this is already off balance, because he can certainly find as much satisfaction in unnecessary as in necessary conversation, perhaps even more, and will look for the opportunity to shift his time from the necessary to the unnecessary.
Attributing value to the unnecessary is the bud from which the kazi things blossom - what you call beauty, entertainment, literature and other nonsense."
Of all this I gathered no more than that he did not really understand what I had said and remarked that there was a great difference between time stolen from work and refreshing entertainment after a decent day's work, which even improved the ability of the mind and the body to work.
He, however, stubbornly reiterated:
"Nothing but damage can result from cultivating non-existing things because we ourselves live in the existing world."
I searched my mind for an example of entertainment to which he could not object even from the point of view of the kazo.
Finally I mentioned chess as a harmless pastime of the soul from which nobody could suffer any harm.
I drew a chessboard, and sketched chess pieces on small slips of paper and then I expounded the rules of the game, which, I may say, was an onerous task.
I had never had such a thick-headed pupil.
When I had explained for the fifth time, he repeated his question for the sixth time:
"But what is the aim?"
"To remove the king of the enemy," I said and began to explain again.
Shrugging his shoulders he eventually agreed to a game.
I made a move with a pawn and beckoned to him to move, at which he took my king, placed it beside the chessboard, and looked questioningly at me.
"And now what is the sense in that?" he asked inanely.
I put the figure back with considerable annoyance.
"It's not that simple!"
"You can see it is!"
"But you must observe the rules!
If you play like that then of course there is no sense in it.
If you play according to the rules, you will see that there is sense in it."
With great difficulty we played a game right through to the end.
Of course, I beat him.
"And now what?" he asked.
"Now I am the winner."
"What does that mean?"
"I have taken the game."
He thought for a long time.
Clearly he still did not under stand.
"And what does that actually mean?" He eventually came out with it.
"That I have won."
"You explain one word with another, which for you seems to be necessary because none of them has anything to do with reality.
You have coined both of them without either of them having any content."
He was unable to understand - as he put it - why we were doing nothing so lengthily and painstakingly, to which there would have been no point even if I had removed his king at the very start, and he drew the conclusion that the whole of our life and public life probably consisted of making complications out of nothing, and that our actions were directed by imaginary idols.
And if we took nothing as actuality, this could only produce poverty, discord, and the accumulation of kazi things, which all seemed to be the aftermath of the disease I had called soul and emotions which drew us away from creative work.
I felt hurt by this belittling tone and contradicted him by saying that it was precisely the soul which gave rise to great works, which soared, which elevated one from prosaic everyday things and induced one to create.
As proof I suggested painting, referring to the fascinating perfection of a "Mona Lisa", the churches, statues, monuments, decorated marble fronts of public buildings - that is, I drew a lesson from what had happened already and mentioned only tangible, real things which even he could not say did not exist, but he stubbornly responded:
"All this proves precisely that the soul takes your energy away from creative work, unbalances it, and diverts it to side-tracks.
The particular thing that I do not understand is how you can describe as a wing that very millstone which prevents you from living an easy life, wastes your energies in false pursuits, and leads you into a maze of problems and into senseless conflicts.
This burden, far from elevating you, hinders your progress and weighs you down but not to the earth which is the only real place for life: it takes you beneath the earth, where you stagger in darkness and are unable to get out to simple, sunny reality.
From this result the many tribulations, hatred, poverty, public buildings, literature, insecurity, gifts, oppression, love, lies, paintings and all the heavy burdens of life you have spoken about."
And all this he interpreted as further evidence that the only way to live was the kazo, cooperative aid, where everybody, working for a common aim, devoted his life to the community.
"This, of course, you express by love, willingness to make sacrifices, and other words which have no connection with reality, although these words designate non-existing concepts on the one hand and lead you on the other hand to deeds which are in contradiction with the pure kazo which is the sole way of true usefulness, only you don't know it."
This was one charge I really could not stomach.
I asserted that in my country every citizen subjected his life to a common aim, as he knew that if the country were lost, everything would be lost.
As the most magnificent repository of the common spirit I mentioned the army, enumerating the struggles of our forefathers, by which the present world power of my country had been established.
Zatamon listened attentively to me for a while, but on his forehead a strange, anxious frown showed more and more strongly.
Then suddenly he stood up and remarked that the day's learning seemed to have been too much for me as I could not even understand his words, and what I had just said not only failed to have any connection with reality but also failed to have any connection with itself so the whole was improbable.
Again I started explaining to him the lofty tasks of national defence.
He questioned me three times and I had to repeat the answer three times, but even so in the end I could only make him see that there were situations when the ordinary citizen had to sacrifice his life so that the country should survive.
At this he asked what the country was.
I told him that it was all the citizens collectively, at which he again did not understand the beginning and asked how we could live collectively in order to die one by one.
I gave a dispirited wave of my hand and he concluded I must be very tired.
With this he wanted to leave.
It was in vain that I protested that all I had said was actually so, it was in vain that I asserted that I myself dealt with healing the wounds inflicted by others - he merely said my words were becoming more and more contradictory and that I had certainly misunderstood something.
But I would not let him go away.
I told him I would explain everything and that he would understand.
Zatamon sat down again.
"But why do you do all this?" he asked.
"Because we have the capacity to feel."
"We have the same senses as you, and yet we don't do it."
"Because you sense heat, light and sound but not happiness."
"What, then, is it that you call happiness?"
"The satisfaction of the soul."
"That is when the soul has had its fill."
"Something like that."
He pondered.
"Did your soul have its fill when we played chess?"
"Yes, because I won the game.
You see, you have no such pleasures."
"And how do you manage to arrange that both parties win the game?"
In spite of my low spirits a smile flitted across my face.
"How can you imagine that?
It is a game for us to play against each other and not for each other.
One of the parties must lose."
"And is the losing party happy too?"
"No.
He is unhappy.
But he, in turn, may be the winner on another occasion."
"Then why do you make one of the parties unhappy?"
To tell the truth his question somewhat surprised me and I had to gather my wits together to make him understand the situation.
"The thing is," I commenced, "that happiness means obtaining certain energy for the soul, and like every energy, this, too, comes from a difference in levels, from the results which I have achieved and not others."
"Explain this more comprehensibly."
By way of explanation I enumerated for him the decorations customary in the Navy; I spoke about the power of the pharaohs, the treasures of the maharajahs, then as an example, I also mentioned stamp-collecting.
"But what would be the point in being decorated," I said finally, "if the same medals hung on everybody's chest?
What would make the Indian maharajah happy if everybody had as many diamonds as himself or the philatelist if everybody had a 'Mauritius'?"
He shook his head.
"As far as I can see, to become happy the unhappiness of not only one person but of very many people is necessary."
"Happiness, as energy, is in proportion to the level attained, which can only be measured by our position in relation to others.
The more people one stands out from among, the happier one is; and it cannot possibly be imagined otherwise.
On the other hand, it is precisely this desire for happiness that prompts us to create and work.
Without this we would be clambering about in the trees to this very day."
This, too, he classified as absolutely incomprehensible, and then came to the conclusion that happiness was an empty and unattainable castle in the air.
"Because," as he said, "it stems from the nature of things that at most only one man can rise above everyone else; that is, all the others are obviously unhappy."
It was his opinion that happiness could not even exist, because if it once existed it would cease to be.
"What do you mean by that?"
"Each of your obsessions ceases to be at the moment of realization, and your imaginary aims, which in general you call cultural endeavours, differ in this very point from real targets.
A hungry man suffers as long as he is hungry, but he is pleased when having eaten his fill, and it doesn't diminish his pleasure if others, too, eat their fill, as the stomach is satisfied not by the hunger of others, that is by the concept of a difference in level, but by the physical fact of repletion.
Your soul, however, feeds only on the hunger of others.
The admiral would be unhappy if everybody were to become an admiral, and the stamp-collector would commit his album to flames if a generous government in its efforts to further common happiness provided a 'Mauritius' for everybody.
Just as love's becoming universal would mean its ceasing and turning into the kazo, in the same manner happiness would not exist any more if everybody was able to achieve it.
This is also why your philosophers rack their brain to discover a happy state.
Well, is it possible to imagine a thing that exists only as long as it does not exist?"
I was about to interrupt but he stopped me with a gesture and continued:
"But let's speak of whether these cultural requirements can be satisfied materially at all.
That is, your soul's endeavour is never to help, but to rob others as this provides the difference of level.
But the stomach of your soul is a bottomless sack, the filling of which knows no boundaries.
The cubic capacity of our actual stomach is defined.
It cannot hold more than a certain quantity of food, and to overburden the stomach is just as painful as hunger.
We feel equally uncomfortable at a temperature of less than 65 ?F and more than 75 ?F, but cultural requirements have no upper limit.
Though your kings travel by coaches of gold and wear robes of state heavy with a hundred kinds of jewels (which, of course, is in itself unnecessary) they still don't permit the people to use their remaining energy for the benefit of their own physical well-being, but force them to build a pyramid for themselves, or wage war against other peoples to reduce these to destitution as well for the sake of the difference of level.
The soul drives you only to trample upon each other and never to help each other, and completely aimlessly into the bargain, as the aim is unattainable."
"You say that happiness is something like repletion.
But it is only the appetite of your body that can be satisfied-this, however, can be fully satisfied.
Were this your goal, then judge, policeman, soldier would all become unnecessary and all goods could lie unguarded in the warehouses since for a kazo man there is no sense in using the labour of his fellow-men to make unnecessary things for himself or shifting manpower from making what is necessary."
"You once mentioned," he continued, "that money ensures the equitable distribution of goods.
On the contrary: it is only an unjust distribution that needs to be ensured by distributing the purchasing power in advance.
The real aims can easily be reached without controlling distribution by force; why, our bodily needs are so small - it is only the fantasy of the soul's happiness that pushes you into squabbles.
The soul is the primary cause of the laws of continuous robbery and struggle."
I had no wish to permit such a false interpretation of the soul and contradicted him by saying that the happiness of the soul could be found not only in rising above others, but in self-humiliation and self-denial as well.
As an example I spoke about Buddhism, which endeavoured fully to conquer all desires.
I mentioned the yogis, who did not wear woollen clothes and were able to do without nourishment for weeks, while they soared high on the wings of the soul away from the earth which is weighed down by desires.
"I'm not at all surprised," he answered, "that the soul is such a confused thing and is in contradiction with itself; all the less so because in the happiness of the maharajahs and the yogis it is only you who see a contrast, and you who believe that love and hatred are opposites."
"It would be much better," he continued, "if the yogi did not soar but remained on the earth and peacefully consumed the meat of the holy cow because no soaring could change our physical existence and from the point of view of the kazo it was equally harmful if we tormented our own body or that of someone else, for all bodies were alike and part of reality."
"The fact," he went on, "that the soul drives you either above or below each other likewise proves that it does not make for balance and harmony but jolts you away from them."
He found it characteristic that the maharajahs haunted the very places where the fakirs' souls soared high, while their bodies starved and were bitten by lice.
"Our bodies consist of atoms," he repeated, "and cannot be changed by any kind of soaring of the soul.
With kazi intentions, however, it is possible to imagine that we do not need air and food but starvation and diamonds, we can even manage to make our pleasures unnatural, which you very aptly call happiness as distinguished from natural pleasure, but our lungs and digestive organs cannot be altered in any way.
Nor is it necessary. Indeed, it is so easy to satisfy the will of nature, whereas to produce diamonds or pyramids or gold coaches is so troublesome and can be done only to the detriment of our stomach and lungs."
In general he was incapable of finding any difference between the life of the maharajahs and that of the fakirs.
He termed both equally sick.
"What, then, is your actual opinion of the soul?" I asked as the debate had grown a little long and I wanted to hear the results briefly summarized.
"The soul is a disease because it is in disharmony with the body.
As long as you are not able to transform the body biologically and become attuned to it, it will continue to cause your ruination."
For a few minutes I struggled with myself. I wanted to respond sharply although I knew that in that way I should achieve nothing.
My ability to curb myself was mainly due to the recognition that in the course of our debate we had completely digressed from the point and my most important question was still unanswered.
He was already at the door when I shouted after him that I wanted an answer to one single question only.
Zatamon turned and I asked him:
"Tell me what keeps the kazo spirit in you?
If you have no laws, no judicature, and no education, what is it that still maintains what you call kazo and equilibrium?"
"What maintains the equilibrium?
Of course, the equilibrium itself!
Only different weights sway the scales."
So once more he wanted to elude me with a cheap aphorism!
This obstinacy began to awake the suspicion in me that he was possibly not so uncomprehending as he appeared to be, but was concealing deeply hidden secrets from me.
But now I had already decided not to let him beat about the bush.
He had either to answer my question or tell me that he could not reveal the secret.
"Are you willing in the end to answer my question?" I asked him straight out.
"What actually is it that you do not understand?"
"I do not understand this total cooperation!
That here nobody has deviating, individual aims of his own.
How can one imagine law without law and morals without morals?
Where is the force that ensures the observation of these courses?"
"I don't know," he replied, "how you can ask such a question.
What forces the planets to keep to their elliptic orbits if not the planets themselves, the force of gravity of which works out in this way?"
Then he explained that it was not the force of gravity that was a separate thing but the planet itself - that is, everything that happened happened as it did because everything that is exists.
Then he continued:
"Force would be needed only if you wanted to shift them to another orbit as force is necessary only for knocking something out of its equilibrium.
You take the kazo for the steel-firm law of cooperation and look for a legislator, whereas it simply exists.
Complete order can result only from things as they are, as everything will surely be in accord with this.
In physics it is called the line of least resistance, which for a freely falling body, for example, is the vertical.
All legislature is only a harmful intervention which is a source of imbalance, errors and insecurity.
In one word: kazi."
"Perhaps we should not speak in parables of doubtful origin drawn from the universe," I answered impatiently. "It might again lead our debate into side-tracks.
I want to become enlightened with regard to your social system."
"You speak as if Man did not belong to the universe.
For you the comparison is reality, so it is small wonder indeed if you consider your non-existent problems to be real."
"What do you mean?" I asked.
"Don't you mean that gravity and the kazo..."
"But yes.
Man lives within the universe-that is, the kazo is neither a law nor a custom but the reality of the universe itself, with which it is also essentially identical.
Everything that exists in the world exists in accordance with the kazo as the kazo is reality.
Anything in addition to this does not exist, as it is kazi which is non-existence itself."
I pondered over his words for a long time.
As became a correct gentleman I wanted to understand his words and not discard them.
Again and again I thought over every sentence conscientiously but the more I racked my brain the more confused it all seemed to me.
Finally I was forced to conclude that their principles were nothing other than half-baked balderdash, completely beyond comprehension to the sober British attitude, and I may claim with a clear conscience that any educated citizen of my country would have come to the same conclusion in my place.
Thus from the whole conversation I came to know only what they lacked and what they were incapable of.
Somewhat meagre information for understanding the secret of the Hin life.
I decided to give up my research for the time being, relying upon time and my own experiences for the solution to my problems.
CHAPTER SIX
Author moves out into Hin life and practises medicine - The Hins' wonderful medical science - Author, though guiltless, becomes involved in murder, through which he leaves his post - The Hins have no consideration for the soul of children - Author becomes a weaver but boredom almost causes him to drift into catastrophe
One day Zatamon told me that as he saw it I had already learned enough and could be a useful member of Hin society.
He observed that though the structure of my brain did not seem sufficiently clear and I would probably not attain as a state the perfection needed for the fullness of life, if I had the will to practise I might become of use.
As he said, he had already come into contact with several undoubted Behins who, even though they lacked the kazo state, had nevertheless been able to perform the tasks of life.
They, of course, had stumbled about as their brain did not possess the natural compass, but the methods they learned by watching others had still shaped their behaviour, so that a non-medical person who was not an expert did not even notice the organic deficiency, in the same way as the deaf-and-dumb person who is able to learn to speak from the lips of others, although he would never experience the essence.
So he informed me that I could leave the institute and commence the work of life.
Thus I was dismissed and filled with anxiety with regard to my future.
I stood bewildered; I asked what I was to do-after all I was not to know where an employee was needed or where they would be willing to employ me.
He, however, replied that I should go wherever I wanted and I should not expect to be directed.
Everyone knew best himself what he was able to do: it would be kazi to interfere in the business of others.
His words, of course, not only failed to reassure me but filled me with the feeling of the utmost insecurity.
In my country every school record has an exact and definite value; the citizen knows what he is entitled to, who is the senior in which of the offices, and who among his own friends is on good terms with him. But what was I to do here in this country of anarchy, thrown as I was to uncertainty?
The first problem was where to live.
I already knew how to obtain lunch and clothes but I was completely ignorant in matters of housing.
After leaving the hospital I loafed about in the neighbourhood for a number of hours and then went off to the forest.
However, the coolness of the evening drove me back.
Finally I took my courage in both hands and entered a house.
I thought I would ask one of the occupants to give me shelter for the night.
The Hins readily entertained people.
(But I really could not call them hospitable.)
And just as I had succeed in finding lodgings after my arrival I might be successful now, too.
I went from flat to flat.
Of course, none of the doors was locked and the occupants did not even glance up at my entrance.
They take no interest in anyone until he speaks.
Furthermore they have no knowledge of undesirable guests in the same way as they have no knowledge of desirable guests either.
The first one whose flat I entered was reading and I did not want to disturb him; the next one lay on his bed already undressed.
In two flats I found nobody at home.
Finally I asked a third to give me lodgings.
"Why?" he asked.
"Is there no empty flat in the house?"
"Well, is there?" I asked with interest.
"I am not to know that.
Go and see!"
"Well, who keeps a record?"
"Nobody," he replied and turned away.
Had I produced my Belohin certificate I might have received some information, but I did not dare to show it too much, because I had been dismissed as a useful member of the society, and while I was looking for employment, I did not want to emphasize what I did not know.
I was left to my own devices so I had to learn everything by myself.
I turned, therefore, without a word and went all through the house.
In each and every flat there was indeed someone, or at least the furniture showed that it was inhabited.
Finally on the second floor I saw a slip of paper hanging on one of the doors:
"I have moved out."
I turned the handle and, of course, the door opened.
I looked around but every sign indicated that somebody still lived there.
All the furniture - chairs, bed, everything was in its place.
There was the telephone, the lamp, and everything was exactly the same as in the room I spent my first night in Kazohinia.
Then what did the slip mean?
I looked around helplessly, but since for the moment there was nobody to be seen inside, I pulled the bed, which was made, out from the wall and threw off my clothes.
Then I went to the bathroom to take a warm bath as I had become quite chilled in the forest.
For half an hour I waited for the host but eventually I became very sleepy, so I went to bed.
It only came to light some days later that the room indeed did have no occupant, and the slip of paper was put outside for that very reason because otherwise nobody would be able to distinguish a vacant flat from an occupied one.
The following morning I had a more thorough look round the room.
Besides the apparatus I already knew, I discovered some buttons on the wall.
Each bore an inscription.
One operated the air-conditioning, a second the window, a third the ventilator.
One button had the inscription "Announcer".
I pushed this one, too, and looked curiously around but nothing happened.
But ten seconds later I was startled by a voice behind me:
"All right."
I turned round, but there was nobody near me.
The voice had come from a loudspeaker on the wall.
I waited to see what was to come next but nothing happened.
I walked to and fro, pondering my future fate.
I lowered the windows and was surprised to see the hundreds of cars slipping along beneath while the elevated railway snaked past above me.
And I had not heard a single sound.
It was as if I had seen a silent film.
In the meantime, of course, the loudspeaker also slipped out of my mind entirely.
Now, however, something clicked behind my back.
I turned.
A flap door opened downwards from the wall and a small metal cylinder protruded from it.
I went over and took hold of it, at which it came off.
As I turned it over I realized that it could be opened.
When I opened it two smaller capsules fell out.
One of them held milk, the other a few pieces of fruit.
Thus by pushing the "Announcer" button I had announced that the occupant of the room was at home.
It seemed therefore that for the time being everything was in order.
The uneasy feeling of uncertainty diminished slightly.
Why, I could live here for any length of time without having to mix with them-of which I was much afraid.
Living among these people one could never be sure when he was breaking the rules of the kazo.
After breakfast I walked to and fro again, almost pleased in the knowledge that I could live in peace.
Later it became somewhat boring and I was almost glad when the door opened and a Hin entered.
He was a little surprised, I thought, that the room still had an occupant.
But then, unperturbed, he went up to the wall, pulled out a vacuum-tube and cleaned the room with it. The bathroom he washed with a hose, he put my breakfast capsule back into the wall, started the ventilator working and then left.
Silence reigned once more and I set about my investigations anew.
Behind a swing-door in the wall I discovered a large opening, which developed into a chimney-like passage.
When I went down to ground level I came to know its function: it ended in a big collecting container into which they threw the dirty clothes.
From here, it seemed, the laundry carried them off from time to time.
Beside it, however, clean linen for public use was displayed in a wardrobe.
Returning to my room I lay down for a while, but then, becoming bored, I went out and sauntered about the streets between the grey, monotonous walls and ungainly trees.
At noon I had lunch in a dining hall and thought about how I should spend my afternoon in order to use my freedom pleasantly.
I thought I would go to the seaside.
When I came to it I walked along the promenade and then climbed a rock.
The eternal surge of the infinite sea slowly made me drowsy.
So I slept for an hour and when I awoke I was haunted again by the problem of what to do until evening.
Blankly and devoid of ideas I walked for another hour and then sat down on a bench.
From sheer boredom I began to twiddle my thumbs.
This I practised backwards and forwards alternately.
I got out my watch several times to see when it would be evening so that I could have dinner.
I set out for a walk and counted my steps, measuring the distances in every possible direction, and regretted that I had not been able to sleep longer.
I was almost glad when I felt hungry.
Eating was always a change.
I went back to the town, had dinner, proceeded homewards and in the dead silence I returned to bed.
After breakfast the next day the cleaner came again.
He looked at me in astonishment and asked:
"If you work in the afternoon why don't you ask them to send the afternoon cleaner?"
I stammered something or other in confusion, this and that - I had forgotten-and he promised that he would report it.
After this I made myself scarce and rambled about aimlessly late into the evening.
Before noon I managed to sleep for an hour on one of the day-beds at the river bank. I got sleepy even after lunch, but I did not dare to lie down in case I should not be able to sleep at night, which would have been still worse.
Thus the thought slowly took shape in my mind that I ought to commence some kind of work, as idling cannot be endured for a long time.
What could I try?
I am a surgeon so first of all I looked for a job within my profession.
The next morning I went out to the hospital and looked for the administrative department.
Of such, however, nobody knew-they said the hospital was for curing the patients.
To a Hin who appeared to be a doctor I related that I myself was a physician.
I referred to the medical qualification I had gained at Oxford University, but he did not know what that was.
I was compelled to reveal my origins, my previous activities, I had to explain the essence of a diploma, but then he asked how people could establish what someone else knew.
"Because," as he put it, "knowledge lives inside the man, there is as yet no way of ascertaining it from without but it is not even necessary as that in which one has acquired proficiency is in any case known by the person concerned.
Anyway, as I see it, I have nothing to do with all this. So tell me, what do you want from me?"
"I should like to be given a job here so that I can work."
"That is entirely your business," he replied.
"Tell me what it is that you want from me."
Now I gazed.
Had I lived among them even for ten years, I could not have become fully acquainted with their complicated customs.
"Understand," I said, "I am a surgeon and wish to work."
Again he replied that that was entirely my business!
"So there is no system?"
"It depends on the faculty.
We cure each disease according to its own system."
My patience was exhausted.
After all, incomprehension, too, has its limits.
I simply stated:
"I want to work here and I am asking you to acquaint me with the work here."
It was only impatience that put these words into my mouth and at that time I was not aware that with this I had found the key to the whole of life there.
Without the slightest surprise my medical colleague took my arm and explained the whole equipment of his department and their customs.
This much I can say: although I had seen many wonderful things with the Hins I could not in my wildest dreams have imagined anything like this hospital and while my colleague led me about I was more and more amazed.
It was not actually a surgery.
They classified diseases according to a completely different system which was new to me.
Nor was it really similar to a hospital.
For when we think of a hospital, we think of clean wards painted white.
Looking at the enormous buildings I, too, thought that at least twenty thousand patients lay there.
It only came to light later that the wards, or, as they called them, sleeping rooms, occupied no more than a very small part of the buildings and there were altogether no more than four or five hundred patients.
And this was for two reasons: firstly, as a result of extensive preventive measures, illness is much rarer with them; secondly, by means of their extremely advanced medical treatment, they recover comparatively quickly.
The largest part of the hospital really resembled a huge plant.
Together my colleague and I walked through an endless row of rooms, both large and small; we moved over balconies with rubber floors, and spiral staircases, and then lifts and moving bands whisked us away to the vast maze of machines and equipment.
In a waist-wide glass-chimney yellowish steam wreathed upwards, beneath and over us silvery coiled pipes hissed, motors shrieked, compressors purred, luminous signals flashed, pointers danced; from the eye of a rotating telescope a red beam of light swept over an endless belt carrying steaming bottles.
Elsewhere a metal basket floated above our heads with a motionless human body inside.
The lid of an immense metal drum opened, blinding flames shot out, the metal basket carried the body straight into the flames and the lid closed.
I was convinced it was a crematorium and was astonished to discover it was a disinfector, and that the flame was not a flame but a radiation which destroyed certain viruses and bacilli but had no effect on the human cells as the patient had formerly been submitted to an immunizing procedure!
These stupidly behaving people are at least a hundred years ahead in therapeutics.
I could hardly even memorize the names of their machines and was terrified to think of what I should do here in order that I, too, could work without revealing ignorance lest I should afford them a basis for their groundless national pride.
To avoid shame I lied that I specialized in dentistry.
After all, the technology of filling and extracting had perhaps not developed to such a degree of wizardry that I should not be able to learn it.
Crestfallen, however, I had to listen to how there were no dental diseases as the food turned out by the dining-halls under the supervision of physicians was at the same time a medicine which prevented the development of certain diseases, including dental ones.
Now I was only trying to think of a good pretext for making my escape but suddenly my colleague said it would be the best if I worked in the sleeping rooms and assisted at the operations which came closest to my knowledge.
His malicious remark was definitely an affront, but his features betrayed neither malice nor any other kind of emotion. I knew I could not go back to dreary idleness and so, though deeply ashamed, I accepted his offer.
I was assigned to a room, and so I put on the white smock and tried to work.
Of course I had to ask questions at every turn.
The very first day my colleague asked me my name.
I was surprised at their taking any interest in the identity of the employees at all, but it turned out that they wanted to send the technical journals to my address.
When I told him, he said that it was not a name as it had no connection with me!
I was astounded that he dared to make such an assertion. After all who knew better than I what I was called. But he repeatedly claimed I had no connection whatsoever with the word Gulliver; this was no more than a senseless pile of letters, and he would help me to recall my name.
Had they not considered laughing a Behin activity I really would have had a good laugh. He, however, in the most natural tone in the world asked for my date of birth and the address of my flat then, converting my birth date to their chronology he said:
"Well, you see, your name is Zamono Nital."
Open-mouthed I gazed at him. After lengthy cogitation I managed to workout the meaning of my "name". The letter "Z" indicated that the word was a personal name, while the other letters conveyed the data concerning birth, sex and professional knowledge, whereas the second word was my telephone number, which was identical with my address.
Thus the Hins, when they change their address, also change half their name.
I wondered why the Hins did not have a name of their own, while he wondered why we had no name of our own but only an irrelevant, senseless pile of letters.
"What is a name for," he asked, "except to give us an idea of the person?"
I retorted that from objective data a person cannot be known as a character anyway. This I could express only in a roundabout way, as they had no word for character, and even then he replied what a strange land my country must be, because there with them everyone breathed oxygen and fed upon carbohydrates and proteins.
But as far as they were from understanding personality, I was just as far from their practical knowledge.
As I have already mentioned, I worked in the sleeping rooms, but my work did not extend to more than nursing.
The sleeping room was approximately equivalent to the concept of our wards.
It was only now that I came to know why they still called them sleeping rooms.
They make every patient sleep whose disease entails pain.
They drive an electric pin into the nape of the patient's neck, from which he sinks into a deep sleep.
The pin is taken out only on full recovery, or at least after the painful period is over.
The Hins simply sleep through their sickness, and while asleep they are artificially fed.
Once I took a cardiac case into the surgery, and was amazed to see how they removed his heart.
They connected tubes to the aorta, which issued into an electric pump and were kept warm; then they temporarily stitched up the patient's body and the pump maintained the circulation for days, while the heart palpitated in some liquid which was replenished every day.
Later the heart was returned to its place.
I had to admit that I would never count as a doctor here.
Afraid that they would despise me because of my ignorance, I was ashamed even to ask questions: perhaps I would even be exposed to their rightful malice, as is usual among colleagues.
Otherwise in reply to my questions they only gave explanations with an indifferent, inscrutable face, from which I could make out nothing.
And to the fact that behind the wooden faces there is indeed no kind of emotion whatsoever, a European cannot be accustomed anyway.
I was always looking for the impulses behind them as I scrutinized their features, and from their coldness I concluded that they actually loathed me.
And in almost completely incomprehensible contradiction to all this was their unlimited readiness to help me at every stage, without one single smile of goodwill or sign of kindness being apparent on their faces.
Their willingness to help misled me so much that I also tried to win their friendship, but all my efforts in this area were rigidly and uncomprehendingly rebuffed.
They asked me to define more exactly what I wanted because what I, after a confused roundabout description, called "friendship" was some sort of abstract concept and consequently it could not be given.
I said in vain that I only wanted somebody to be with me, support me and converse with me; they asked what he should do and what he should converse about; they would do anything as long as I said positively what I wanted.
Regardless of how much I had already heard of them, I still received their words like those of lordly aristocrats who use a polite pretext to exclude an intruder from their circle.
I looked upon them as on undecipherable diplomats, perhaps precisely because I had become accustomed to unenigmatic faces covering the greatest psychological complexities.
My position, which was in any case rather awkward, was made extremely unpleasant by the differences of knowledge and society.
When in the surgery the scalpel gleamed from one hand to the other soundlessly and with the precision of clockwork, I was merely jumping around them like a scalded cat, and shame made me blush all over my face whenever a voice cut into the stony silence, as it was always meant for me.
And it was in vain for me to browse through the trade literature which the dispatch-tube regularly delivered to my flat - as far as I was concerned it might have been written in Martian.
The whole consisted of algebraic expressions, even for the medicines; their effects were not described, only their chemical properties, of which I did not understand a word.
And my colleagues were like the sphinx.
If they had at least scolded me, I would have borne everything more easily.
But the detached educating tone, concerning which I never knew what lay behind it, this vacuum-like intangibility of their soul was getting on my nerves.
My situation was made utterly intolerable by a dreadful event which completely unsettled my Christian and humanitarian outlook.
We visited a dying patient.
My colleague examined the sleeping man, and then called another physician, who examined him again.
Then the first stepped to the medicine-chest and handed a phial to me to give him an intravenous injection.
As soon as I had injected the contents of the syringe into the patient it was my greatest horror to find that death ensued with immediate stiffening.
I rushed to my colleague, asserting that I had not been the one to change the injection, and he, with complete composure told me that no change had taken place, the person in question had been a hopeless case and his life had therefore to be ended, so I should phone the Conveying Department.
I staggered.
I was a murderer!
I stammered out a few words asking what the people belonging to him would say to such a procedure, but he replied that only a suit and a pair of shoes had belonged to him, and such things were always burned for reasons of hygiene.
And people perished without anyone shedding a single tear for them!
Nobody knew his mother and father, nor did parents know their children, and as soon as the dying patient reached the point of death he was considered no more than rubbish to be removed!
"So you are able to deny the fundamental aim of the medical profession?" I asked once I had more or less pulled myself together.
"What kind of aim are you thinking about?"
"To maintain life up to the last possible moment."
My colleague stepped nearer to me with interest.
"Is that the aim of the medical profession in your country?"
"Why in my country?
Everywhere.
No other aim can even be imagined."
"That's a mistake.
The aim of our profession is to save man from suffering.
And of course, if at all possible, to give him back his health.
And if that is not possible, we end his life without pain, not to cause him unnecessary suffering and ourselves superfluous work, which energy we would be withdrawing from treating others where success would be certain."
Although these cruel words were already enough to hurt my humanitarian feelings, my colleague went on:
"Besides, there are cases when recovery can only be partial and would entail a life of suffering.
Especially when the patient loses a part of his body for which there is no perfect substitute.
For instance, if we are to remove only his heart or a lung, it can easily be replaced by transplantation or by an artificial heart or lung.
Even an ear can be replaced by an artificial one which can be attached to any functioning nerve, and within a short space of time the patient will learn to hear again.
But the replacement of eye, for example, is only at the experimental stage, and the photoprotheses issued up to now can only be attached to an intact optic nerve and visual centre.
It is even worse when somebody loses a leg and he would have to limp with an artificial leg for ever.
Obviously such a patient's life would be ended while sleeping."
I trembled with horror.
"I only wonder," I said, "that anybody dares to go into your hospitals at all."
"Why would he not dare when he knows that from the minute of his arrival all his suffering is over?"
"And the life instinct?"
"You must mean the vital instinct inherited from animal life.
This atavistic attitude also existed here some thousand years ago, but today our instincts have, of course, adapted themselves to our present circumstances.
You have mentioned that a tooth can still decay in your country.
You know what pain this entails..
One feels that the aching tooth should be pulled out, and indeed the decayed tooth will in no way cure itself, so it would only be logical that with the pain of the decayed tooth should go the pleasure of the extraction.
Instead of this, the tooth reacted with racking pain even to the slightest touch, protesting against the only possible cure.
So even in nature there is inconsistency."
"But the life instinct..."
"That was just as inconsistent.
The patient, even raging with pain and in a completely incurable state, still insisted on his life."
"Because it is a natural instinct."
"That was appropriate to primitive conditions.
Our civilization, however, changed our environment and our way of life.
If our instincts adapted themselves today to the ancient environment and were not selected for the type of man suited to the present environment, this would indeed be unnatural, as an internal contradiction would destroy our life."
"And this is why you put people to death?
This is the real contradiction!"
"This is why we don't commit murder.
Under primitive conditions people had to fight against each other for food, while today we ourselves produce it.
If our primitive instincts had not developed along with our civilization, we would still be killing each other today, whereas for food we must not kill but support each other in production.
Yes, we would kill, without even knowing why, under artificially concocted pretexts, but by keeping the hopeless patient alive we would compel him to continue suffering.
Well, this would be a contradiction."
"You speak of contradiction when you serve life by ending it?"
"The opposites are not life and death but life and suffering."
"Why, then, do you cure at all?
If your aim is purely to avoid suffering, why don't you put the new-born baby to sleep and then immediately to death?
After all, going by your principles we inevitably arrive at the conclusion that the most perfect being is non-being.
And, indeed, in non-existence there is no contradiction, while in your thinking there is no end of them."
"We have made life safe and abundant and it is worth being born into it and recovering.
The patient is brought to us by his healthy instinct which is adjusted to the environment because he knows that we shall cure him and bring him back to a painless life and, if his future life is threatened with suffering, we shall cure him by giving him a painless death.
Your hospitals, on the other hand are torture-chambers left behind by a primitive age.
I wonder that anybody has the courage to enter them."
Of course, his words not only failed to convince me: I became even more horrified by this rigid and ruthless way of thinking according to which human life was not one bit more sacred than that of beef-cattle.
Indeed, it is only a soulless creature that can without protest tolerate that the individual's most elementary right to life be trampled into the dust.
I could not stay there a minute longer.
I rushed out and travelled a long way from the towns.
And where nobody could see me, I threw myself to the ground and begged the Lord of Heaven to forgive the immeasurable sin in which this heartless, vicious and murderous race had involved me against my will.
With this, however, the cup was full.
Somehow I had to switch over to an occupation which might fall within my province but where I would at least not be required to kill.
In the end, an excellent solution presented itself as the thought flashed through my mind that I should matriculate at their university where I would be able to spend my time as a passive student.
With this I not only thought I could solidify my position among them and dispel my boredom; I was also mainly led by the thought that later when I returned to my country I should be able to do valuable service to my country and Christian civilization if I could give back life to those of our soldiers who at that time seemed hopelessly wounded.
According to my rough estimation if we were able to extend the life of every British sailor even only twice before final death in action, His Majesty's Navy would be able to cause about seventy per cent more casualties to the vile enemies of my country and civilization.
I told my colleague that I realized that my knowledge was incomplete and I therefore wanted to study further at the university and asked for his consent, to which again I got the reply that that was my business.
So I announced my withdrawal, my post was taken over by a Hin, and I went to the university.
I went into an enormous complex of buildings where all kinds of schools were grouped together. I could not even establish what belonged to the school and what to the other houses in the street.
We are accustomed to finding that buildings which are grouped together are closed in by fences.
Now the Reader should imagine a group of houses with gardens, which are neither separated from the pavement nor divided from each other by any visible boundary and there is no difference between street and yard.
To this very day I do not know on what territory I was standing when I caught sight of a man pushing a handcart with a male corpse lying on it without any shroud.
I started at the sight but I was already accustomed to finding no shame among the Hins, so I reconciled myself to the situation - indeed I was glad of the chance to find' the medical faculty by following the cart.
Along I went after it.
The cart approached a door which opened by itself.
We came into a corridor.
To my great surprise I saw quite small children in the corridor, but the Hin pushed the cart along among them without any emotion.
Some of the children did actually turn their attention towards it, and followed the cart with interest.
This was too much for me to accept without indignation.
And this was only the beginning!
The real surprise ensued only when the Hin pushed the corpse into a room.
On three other, tables in the room three human corpses were already lying, surrounded by innocent tots of both sexes!
And in the rubber-gloved hands of the children there were knives with which they dissected the intestines and private parts of the corpses without the slightest awe.
This astounding sight quite took my breath away.
I turned to an adult who was explaining something to the children.
I asked whether they were to be physicians, although that in itself appeared strange to me that they were inculcated at the age of seven-eight years with what in civilized Europe was revealed to the developed mind only at the age of twenty.
I was given the answer that they were not yet learning any particular profession - only the fundamentals necessary for life. The physicians were in the other building.
I could not help posing a question.
"Then under what pretext did the corpse get into the hands of children?"
To this he replied in the most natural tone in the world that teaching commenced with this.
One had to know one's own body first of all.
This obscene and vulgar trampling down of the children's innocence filled me with such a disgust that I left the room without a word and no longer felt any interest in the faculty of medicine either.
I would rather do without their science than suffer this frivolous outrage of the human soul even only as a passive spectator.
The next days were again marked by hopeless boredom.
As soon after breakfast as possible I had to leave my flat and take to the woods.
If rain or cool weather drove me in to town, hanging about the streets was even duller.
I was surrounded by tens of thousands of people and still I felt perfectly alone.
My only pleasure was to watch my stomach - whether I might be able to eat something.
Hunger and its appeasement were the only variety in my life.
If I was sitting I stood up, if I was standing I sat down, and was continuously thinking about what I could while away my time with.
Regrettably the pen can only describe the horrors that actually happen, although it is more horrible than all of these if nothing at all happens, so to those of my Readers who are surrounded by the colourful and varied British public life and have no knowledge of this, I depict it in vain.
I was exiled into nothingness.
I should have looked for an occupation but was unable to participate in their vicious and inhuman life.
I wanted work that would be naturally independent of their offensive customs and which I would be able to learn without any special grounding.
Something, at any rate, I simply had to do, because things could not continue in this way.
Great Britain is famous for two things: for her navy and for her textiles.
The Hins have no marine service but they do have a textile industry.
This was how I came to think I could be a weaver.
At that time I still foolishly believed that it would dispel my boredom.
Why should I bore the Reader with details?
After all, such things don't really exist here.
Life here does not take place, it only is.
When one has been born, one is until one dies, then others are.
I asked for the address of the textile mill (there is only one of each type of factory, though this is colossal) and found it.
I found myself in a very high, twelve-storey building with glass walls, which extended farther than the eye could see, and there I told the very first Hin that I wanted work there.
(By this time I had managed to acquire the style.)
They assigned to me a master workman who took me by lift to the seventh floor.
This consisted of one single vast room about half a mile long -but only twenty paces wide in which approximately ten thousand very strange but completely identical power-looms were running.
Between the endless rows of machines there was a wide corridor.
We proceeded on a soft, springy rubber floor, the ceiling was one single butter-yellow, porcelain-like surface and on both sides the sunshine, subdued by being filtered through the opaline walls, produced decidedly the most perfect lighting I have ever seen.
The master conducted me to the machines and explained how they worked.
Everything went very easily.
My work consisted of looking after sixty power-looms.
The warp threads came down above through the ceiling to the machine; the supply was never exhausted because up there, by some procedure unknown to me, they were being spun continuously.
Practically my machines consisted of shuttles whisking to and fro and I had no need even to change the bobbin as it was transported by an endless band also coming down from above to the shuttle magazine.
If the thread ran out it was replaced automatically.
At home this factory would have been considered a real wonderland.
I do not know what kind of material they used, but while I was there no thread breakage occurred at all although the shuttles worked at least five times faster than at home.
Their impact frequency surpassed the work of the most accomplished drum major.
When it was ready the textile then flew through the floor to the finishing shops where, through the rows of shearing, washing, ironing, brushing and other machines, it passed down from floor to floor, then to the tailors' workshop, where a squeezer cut the forms at one single pressing and let them down to the 'sewing' shop, where a machine that replaced the sewing machine, proceeding along the edges of the cloths, glued the pieces together.
This bond was stronger than sewing.
The raw material for man-made fibre was pressurized up to the twelfth floor through a pipe, on the ground floor they loaded the finished goods from handkerchief to winter-coat into trucks, whereas I had only to see to the smooth running of the machines and replace any worn out parts.
When the master saw that I had acquired the knack of it, he pushed a chair under me and left.
In the immense room extending farther than the eye could see I had about a hundred colleagues all working wordlessly.
There was no supervision at all.
Most of my companions were sitting,' nor did they stand up when the master appeared, which surprised me not a little, and I drew sad conclusions concerning their discipline compared to that in my country where, in appreciation of the value of order and labour discipline no seat is made even for the tram driver.
With them, it seemed, it was only important that the textile should be made, that they should have something to wrap around their soulless bodies and for the loftier social aims that distinguished man from brute beast, they did not care a fig.
I could not help smiling at the thought of what a soldier would have made of such a soft sybaritic Hin.
I was downright sorry for a strapping lieutenant-commander who might have wanted to make men of them.
So this was where I was to spend my life.
In the early days I was not even bored because, although I did not dare to ask questions, purely from watching them I came to know a lot about them.
At the very outset I saw that everything worked there by itself.
Nowhere could I perceive a central directing force and yet some invisible bond united the big machinery into a clockwork of the utmost precision in which there was not one dissonant movement; in none of the workshops were there too many or too few workers.
No record was kept of the material; they just processed what was furnished by the initial production unit which in turn adapted itself to the capacity of the clothes depots.
Also the scope of the individual's activity evolved according to mutual agreement; there was neither election nor appointment, everything was done by the individual himself and still there were no disputes.
I did ask how they could maintain the balance without arranging and directing organs and they in turn could not understand how the balance could be maintained if any external will meddled in the business.
According to them everyone had his own kazo sense.
To me kazo appeared a sixth sense, yet they never mentioned it as an ability but as self-evident reality.
"Why should an organizing force be necessary?" they asked.
"Anyone who knows the difference between an ironing machine and a spinning machine will not be in the least likely to arrive at the idea of ironing with a spinning machine."
They did not even understand what I had asked.
My new place of work was, however, in the town and my flat on the outskirts near the hospital.
So I had to look for a new one.
On the very first day after work I set out to find a new flat but in the houses nearby none of them was empty.
Finally a brilliant idea occurred to me.
After all, I already knew their customs a little.
In one of the nearby houses I entered a flat and told the Hin who lived there without the slightest introduction:
"I wish to live here.
Move out."
My Readers should try to imagine this happening in Europe!
But I knew that with them there was no order, and based my calculations on this fact.
And I was not disappointed.
The Hin without the least surprise or resentment asked:
"Why?"
"Because I work in the neighbouring weaving mill and this flat is more convenient for me."
The Hin said he worked at a dining hall in the third street from there.
He found my proposal kazo, stood up, yielded the flat and moved out, perhaps only to force someone else out of his home in the third street from there in the same concise and simple manner.
The removal consisted of his putting a tooth-brush, some soap and two books into a suitcase, throwing his bedclothes and underwear into the chute for dirty linen, and then he left, abandoning all the furniture, lamp, telephone, dishes, coat-rack, and gymnastic apparatus, as in the next place he would find the same; only the tooth-brush and the soap are not passed on for reasons of hygiene.
I cannot deny life among the Hins also had its sunny side, but even so there is no bloodless philistine in Europe who would endure this environment.
Their way of life always reminded me of distilled water although it is clear, distillation has extracted from it the salts necessary for life.
One drinks and drinks and it still does not quench one's thirst.
After a few days I sank once more into deadly boredom.
The machines in the weaving-room workshop buzzed the same monotonous buzz every day, my companions wordlessly did their work; if I asked them anything, they discouraged me with brief, official answers.
Conversation was virtually out of the question.
I performed my uneventful work with reflex-like movements while the soul-killing Midsummer Day's humming of the machines really got on my nerves.
I became weary of roaming about the bleak, undecorated streets which were afforded no variety by a statue, a column or at least an archway.
The streets were numbered by characters: "ab", "ac", "ad", "af", etc. (transliterated, of course, to our alphabet).
They were all the same, and each was exactly perpendicular to or parallel with the next - with parks among them at regular intervals.
Shop-windows and advertising are unknown here - there would be no point in having them anyway.
Only over a few doors could be seen the laconic inscription "clothes depot", "cold food", or "electric articles", but inside there was not a single soul except the drawers of rations (for I cannot call them buyers).
This was the street as it was by day.
And in the evening everything was desolate.
There were no theatres, cinemas or restaurants.
Alcohol was known only as a medicine, as far as religion was concerned they did not even know what it was and if I had mentioned it at all, it is absolutely certain they would have taken me for a Behin.
At ten o'clock darkness fell on the streets. At night no kind of factory operated, and I had to go home, to the empty flat, where at best I lifted the dumb-bell, but having nobody to compare my strength with, this, too, became infinitely tedious.
Summer followed.
One day I noticed that several people went about naked in the street; some wore sandals on their feet, and from their shoulder hung a bag on a canvas strap.
The first I took for a madman, of another I thought he was a nudist.
Finally, pulling myself together, I asked one, but he did not even know what the word meant, and hurried on.
But then why did he go around naked?
What kind of a sect was this whose ribald whims offended against public morals?
Finally I also put this question to one of them, but he seemed to misunderstand me, because he said it was warm.
Shaking my head I remarked that whatever the essence of their fad might be, nudity would be gravely punished in my country, at which he stared open-eyed and asked me how we could avoid nudity, as under his clothes everyone was naked.
I did not even condescend to answer his stupid question, so he hurried on, and I became convinced that however strict discipline seemed to be with them, citizens still could not be left completely without reins because, as the example showed, without public order, even in the most disciplined society the licentiousness of the primitive animal comes to light, and sooner or later plunges culture to ruin.
Nevertheless in a few days nudity also appeared in the factory.
Every day more and more workers, both men and women, came in without clothes.
Fortunately nobody forced me to follow this indecent fashion.
I merely followed the example of those who put on lighter clothes, with trousers coming down to the knees, leaving only the calves uncovered.
Many times I went down to the sea, where lots of people were lying, walking or bathing on the splendid beach.
Most of them were naked here, too; they were in the same condition even in the tram.
The only thing they carried with them was a strapped up, flannel-lined raincoat. They did not take any thing else knowing that food could also be obtained on the beach; they did not smoke, and latch-keys did not exist.
Every one went separately and wordlessly.
Much as my sober European outlook found this frivolous and licentious custom deeply repulsive I cannot deny that to begin with the fresh women's figures, steeled by sports activities, awakened desires in me.
After a few days, however, nudity became so habitual that I took no notice of it, and women not only failed to be more desirable, I might even say they lost their charm.
I realized that I was more intrigued by those women whose bodies were covered by the exciting veil of clothes.
In nakedness, there was simply nothing interesting to appeal to a man's imagination.
But why did they undress?
For me this was the last novelty in Kazohinia.
Now I knew all about their life, and from then on my life sunk into boredom.
For books I looked in vain because, as the Reader already knows, apart from technical, medical, physical, and chemical works, there was nothing.
As for a work that might have had something to offer the soul, they had no idea about that.
Perhaps I need not even say they had no newspaper either, unless I counted as a newspaper the trade journal "Textile Industry" which appeared at irregular intervals, in which the factory laboratory informed the workers of the development of new processes and which the dispatch-tube forwarded to my flat.
This was my only reading, which I skimmed through of necessity, but I was even sicker of that than of my life.
Slowly I began to loath the Hins.
Not as if I had not loathed them up to then as well, but this feeling gradually became unbearable.
When they passed by me tongue-tied or imparted to me with the most official brevity what they wanted to tell me, I felt an irresistible urge to slap them on the face just so that something should happen.
I looked for pretexts to address someone.
I asked the number of trams, streets and addresses as it was only to such questions that they replied.
My Readers, who have experienced no more than a taste of boredom, cannot even imagine what absolute boredom is like.
With us boredom is known only from abortive summer holidays when the citizen of a big town "rests" his nerves in a room in a peasant house in a dusty hole at the back of beyond, and by the third day he is yawning and realizes that it is much easier to go mad from boredom than from the most nerve-racking work.
Notwithstanding that, even in the remotest village something happens; if nothing else, the Sunday service, an occasional game of cards with the parish priest or the chemist, a wedding, a game of skittles in the restaurant, a fight or at least some gossip.
Here, however, there was nothing.
There was no friend, enemy, pleasure, grief, rank, rich, poor, creation, progress - in short, no variety.
Or to put it in another way - no life.
What is life if not the difference between yesterday and today and expecting something of tomorrow.
To stop is to die.
Zatamon was right: they had indeed been successful in eliminating contradictions, and levelling everything out.
In this "life" there were no peaks or valleys, love or hatred, white or black, only the infinite dead vacuum, over which the migratory bird fell dead.
They had eliminated light because it had existed only together with the shadow. But how can we see if everything is equally bright?
And if everything is silent, what are our ears for?
Emptiness deafened, blinded and paralysed me.
I was completely alone.
Neither in the mill nor outside did a single soul speak to me.
I could not play a game of cards, as they did not know how to play.
I thought of painting cards for myself and playing patience, but where was I to hide them? Why, my flat was cleaned daily, and if they noticed my cards they would take me for a Behin.
Once I lost my self-control and began to hum a tune by the power-loom.
My companions ran up to me anxiously and I immediately fell silent.
I had even to mind my breath.
I should have liked at least to live together with somebody. Only that there should be a living being in my room, even if he did not say a word. But nobody lived in one room with others, and I could not even bring up the subject.
The only thing my empty room was good for was having a good cry in the evening after I had carefully closed the door.
At such times I pressed my face into the pillow and wept so that my heart almost broke.
But I had to take care that they did not hear it, and it did not ease my mind either.
I paced about like a caged beast of prey looking for air and life.
Here I stood, in the biggest possible prison; I was free in vain - the air around me was not free.
I withered away without companions, in the country of Nothing between the endless funeral dirge of the power-looms and the deadly silence of my room, where my life energy was being wasted in an empty existence without once being able to say that I had achieved anything.
Once I caught a cold and lay for three days with a fever, and, believe it or not, for me sickness was a pleasure.
Because finally something happened - even a doctor came to me to inquire after my condition.
Of course, he offered to have me taken to hospital where I would regain my health in the radiation oven in ten minutes.
I did not agree. I answered that my condition was not so grave, that I would also recover from it this way, and that he should only send me an extra blanket and examine me every day.
He shook his head and voiced his surprise at my insisting on such an obsolete cure, whereas in half an hour I could if I wanted go back to the factory in full health, but he consented and visited me on two more occasions.
How I needed a little affection!
But I recovered, the pretext for visiting me disappeared, and restored to health, I became more ill than I had been with the fever.
I saw in despair how the days passed one after the other, squandering the short human life.
They merged hopelessly into each other so that I did not know whether two months or two years had passed, for they had no calendar in our sense either, there was no Saturday, holiday, anniversary, event, party, disaster, one day disappeared emptily after another without any landmark for the soul to catch at.
Once when it occurred to me that perhaps I would eventually have to die here without living one single day I was so shocked that when I arrived home I could not fall asleep.
My agony began with bitter sobbing, and then despair so overcame me that I could not control myself any more.
With a horrible fury I ripped apart the pillow that had been pressed tightly to my mouth; I sprang to my feet and, tearing my hair and beating my head with clenched fists, I wanted to smash all the pieces of furniture in my prison to smithereens.
At that time some great strength of mind still restrained me from committing any thoughtless act but I felt that it was the final test for my self-control.
If some change did not take place soon, terrible things would follow.
The next day I could hardly wait for the working hours to be over.
I took the fast line, hoping that the speed would perhaps fix my attention, but I had to associate the speed with different colourful, wild situations - that the jaws of hell were before us and I was the driver, shooting with hundreds of women and children into damnation.
I ran to the forest, and where nobody could see me I bellowed at the top of my voice and ran as long as my lungs and muscles could take it and then in wild anger I dashed against a tree and stabbed at it repeatedly with my pocket knife.
But I felt that even this postponed catastrophe for no more than a day.
On the third day I acquired a car from the garage (this, too, was common property), drove it away, and smashing into a tree I broke it so that I fell against the wind-screen and my face was injured.
The next car stopped unprompted, took me away, and at a breakneck speed shot with me to the town and while they dressed my insignificant wound the driver phoned to the garage to haul away the damaged car.
Then, seeing that I did; not need him, he left me.
Even in their dreams they would not contemplate the idea that anyone would touch something with anything but goodwill and competence.
So they dismissed me without a single prying or reproachful word, making me promise that if I had the slightest trouble with my wound I should report immediately. And once again there I stood aimlessly in the torturing silence, all alone and with nobody to care for me.
And whatever I did, I could do it only to myself; whatever I did, nothing ensued.
I kicked over the traces in vain, there was no point as there were no traces.
It was as if I were pummelling the thin air.
My life cried out without any echo and I had nothing to hold on to.
I hovered in space where there was no upwards or downwards, forwards or backwards, only the unsatisfied desire for life kicking within my numbed being.
Without resistance there is nothing to win, there is no excitement, there is no life.
And I saw clearly that of all my troubles loneliness was the most unbearable.
There was no one to love me, to take care of me.
True, I did not have the worries they would have entailed, but that was all the worse.
I needed someone to hold my hand and protect me.
True, there was no enemy, but I would have preferred to have one.
Maybe Zatamon was right in saying that love could only be brought into existence together with hatred. However, the void had to be filled with something, as it was unbearable in itself because there was no existence in it.
It occurred to me that one never set out for the Sahara alone.
Not because of the dangers, but because human nerves cannot tolerate absolute silence, which in nature they generally never experience.
I felt that my efforts were but the futile panting of the passenger in a rising balloon, which cannot keep up with the thinning of the atmosphere.
I had to cling to someone, I had to snatch at a hand as I felt clearly how I was drifting day after day towards an abyss from which, if I once fell into it, there would be no recovery.
CHAPTER SEVEN
Author becomes acquainted with a hin woman in whom he wants to build a soul - His experiments have unfortunate consequences - He is taken once more to hospital
I was in the same mood when the next day dawned.
After work I hurried to the seashore where I took a long walk.
The soundless, amorphous mass of Hins teeming round me with such inexplicably strange, regular disorderliness brought an ant hill to mind.
Seeing their cleverly attentive glances and in spite of all my earlier experiences, the desire to approach them awoke in me anew. That day I felt this desire even more keenly but when I was about to speak, I was held back by the knowledge that if they were to refuse me on this particular day, my increased tension would reach breaking point and I would be carried away by stupidities.
I was walking the promenade for the tenth time and evening was already closing in when bitterness drove me from their circle.
To escape temptation and deadly disappointment I clambered up the rocks.
The air was soft and spicy, the moon had slowly emerged from the water, broken into a thousand pieces on the waves, and gracefully performed the nymphs' dance.
The sea washed against the beach with its ceaseless murmur and then, dividing into thousands of pearls, fell away from the rocks.
In the distance strange birds were wheeling and crickets chirred beneath the long-tressed trees.
My heart was full to overflowing with intoxicating desire, the will to live. And below, the Hins were walking, sitting or lying alone and wordlessly, not deigning to cast as much as a glance at the poetry of nature.
Then I was cut to the quick by the knowledge that over this wide expanse of water, far away, my friends were chasing the Jolly Joker in the club; the speakers in Hyde Park were expounding their views of the world; ladies were hurrying to the theatre in enchanting attire, and in the streets glittering neon signs advertised the latest stars.
Helplessness twisted my heart. I struggled against myself for a few minutes longer, but by this time I was weak.
I had to admit I could bear loneliness no more.
I scrambled down from the rocks, and all traces of my former inhibition disappeared.
On the beach there were already fewer people walking.
On one of the benches lay a woman.
The light one-piece suit made even more obvious the harmony of her clean Aphrodite-face.
It was she whom I approached.
She addressed me:
"Don't make me get up.
The next bench is unoccupied."
"I don't want to lie down," I said firmly. "I should like to talk to you."
At this she immediately stood up.
"What do you wish?"
I pointed at the sea.
"Do you see the ocean?
Do you feel the atmosphere of evening?
Don't you find this rather pleasant?"
One feels extremely awkward with this deficient vocabulary in which there are only such imperfect words for things exalted and elevating.
With them, everything was simply kazo and kazi of which I was already sick and tired whenever I even heard them.
"Yes, I do," she said.
"It is pleasant.
What do you wish?"
"What do you wish!" I said impatiently.
"Nothing!
Warmth!
I should like to get closer to you!"
"Are you cold?"
"Not in the least!"
"Then why do you say so?"
Seeing those vacuous eyes it came back to me how a woman had pulled off my trousers in front of the clothes deposit and I was convinced that here every woman could be had for money.
But in this desert where was even money to be found?
What a pleasure it was at home to buy gifts for our ladies of pure and fine spirit!
What a happy feeling it was to deprive ourselves, to make sacrifices for someone beloved and to see how her heart filled with love towards us.
But here everything was ready-made, everything was the property of everyone, there was no money, there were no gifts, no sacrifices.
How did a man love here, and why did a woman love?
"I don't mean that kind of warmth," I said. "I simply want your closeness.
I want to hear your voice..."
"Why?" she broke in.
"For your voice itself.
I want to have somebody to whom I can talk not out of necessity but for amusement, about trifles, to make our life more pleasant."
"How do you mean that life would be more agreeable if we deprived it of its sense by empty conversation?"
This reply was more characteristic than anything else.
The main impression of the whole of my stay here was that technique and perfect hygiene were present in vain, as the whole had no aim, the whole had no why or wherefore.
And for them this life meant life and they regarded ours as senseless.
But I already thirsted deeply for pleasure and beauty.
"Tell me," I said in a trembling voice, "don't you feel at times that you need someone who appreciates you, someone to whom you can relate what pleases and displeases you; someone who is for you more pleasant than the others?
I need somebody very much, to hold; someone to whom I can nestle close and with whom I can exchange tender words, and whose voice would quench my thirst.
Look at the moon as it dances on the waves divided into a thousand pieces, look at the millions of stars, the evening, the sea, this endless night which drives people to each other and opens hearts to each other..."
"I don't understand," she interrupted. "Stop it!
Time is passing without purpose whereas I have a wish."
A new quiver filled my limbs, more and more I was feeling that this disappointment would be fatal and the inner tension would burst its limits.
"I am at your disposal," I said trembling.
"My desire has awakened, and apart from this I have still to give birth to two children.
Are you available for sexual work?"
I gazed at her vacuously.
I did not want to believe my ears.
"Well, isn't that what I've been speaking about?" I asked and you could have struck me down by a feather.
"No," she replied in an educative tone. "You spoke of the sea, stars, moon and night."
I was taken aback.
I had reckoned with everything except this.
And although I could have danced with joy, the quick confession produced strange, dissonant after-thoughts in me, similar to those I had felt when I heard that to one of the steep crags of the Alps, the tourist dream of my youth, a cable-railway had been constructed.
Oh, how much sweeter were the kisses that I had taken from the lips of our tender girls in times past, at home, with whom I had talked at first about the theatre and fashion and had then come to the point in an exploratory manner only weeks later with both of us blushing partly from shame, partly from desire.
How sweet and thrilling was the feeling of reaching what is far away, opening what is closed, chasing the hunted prize, until finally the gentle creature, after lengthy protestation, shut her eyes and panted "No!
No!" - and gave in.
How is it possible to love without all this sweet struggle?
Desire, however, prompted me. Why, I had been thirsting for beauty for so long that even a morsel was a royal dish.
And lest I should also lose her, I began explaining that what I wanted was far from being the opposite of her aims but a much more complete and perfect form of them.
Zolema (later it came to light that this was her name) looked at me inquiringly, and gently pulling her closer to me, I continued:
"Imagine that the sun in the sky gave only light and no warmth."
"Without the warmth of the sun, human life would become impossible!"
"It would, wouldn't it?" I said enthusiastically.
"Life can really be lived only in its fullness because if any of the components is missing, it is no longer life."
This also Zolema found an unobjectionable and sensible statement in perfect harmony with the kazo and I was glad to have found a bridge to their armoured soul and began talking to her of the attraction that warmed hearts and made couples of men and women.
Who could possibly describe my pleasure when I saw that Zolema listened to this with gleaming eyes!
Her attentive face came closer and closer to mine, she breathed more and more passionately and then...
But it cannot be described so simply!
What happened was something like when the rope is put on the condemned man's neck and then the letter of reprieve arrives.
How it happened I do not know to this very day but suddenly our lips met!
And Zolema did not resist...
Not only did she not resist but it was I who had to ask of her that we should draw aside somewhere.
"Why?" she asked.
"Somebody may come."
"Anybody may come.
It doesn't matter."
"But I don't want anybody to see us.
I want to be alone with you."
"Why?"
My blood was throbbing, I was not in any mood to enter into new explanations.
I asked her to come with me to the rock, otherwise I would not be able to comply with her wish.
Zolema pointed to a nearby house.
"I would rather go there."
I agreed but was in a hurry.
When we reached the house, Zolema led me into a regular flat which was like all the others.
Inside, a Hin was sitting at a table having his supper.
Zolema sat down on a chair, the Hin did not even turn towards us.
Some minutes passed in silence.
Finally I asked Zolema:
"Now what are we waiting for?"
"For him to finish eating.
You see, he is hungrier than we are, so it would not be kazo to interrupt him."
I was compelled to wait.
The minutes passed with nerve-racking slowness.
The Hin eventually finished and began to tidy away the plates one by one, when Zolema interrupted:
"Leave for a few minutes."
Now he turned towards us.
"When shall I come back?"
"Take a seat on the bench in front of the gate.
I shall let you know."
The Hin left, Zolema pulled the bed out of the wall, unfastened her clothes and without any prelude threw herself into my arms with such ardour that I must dispense with detail.
At that moment I felt the whole of my life there had been nothing but a nightmare, because, behold, I had found the philosophers' stone, the panacea, the Soul!
Every single drop of my blood was in exultation.
Emanating from the end of the dark tunnel with royal brilliance came light, voices, flavours, and in my heart resounded the soaring symphony of life!
Regrettably my pleasure did not last long.
After a quarter of an hour we left.
Zolema told the Hin sitting on the bench that he could go back, and I asked her who the kind host was.
It came to light that she did not even know him and that that was the first time she had seen him.
"Then how did you dare to lead me in and send him out?" I asked in surprise.
She looked at me.
"You wanted nobody to see us, and you wanted to be alone with me!"
"And did he just at a word leave his flat?"
"Of course.
You heard me ask him to do so."
I gazed silently.
Zolema, referring to the lateness of the hour, said she wanted to go home.
Naturally, I offered to see her home, at which she asked me why I did not go to my own flat.
When I explained that I would accompany her only as far as her flat, she briefly said that there would be no sense in my going out of my way.
This reply started an avalanche of problems in me.
Had it been said by another Hin I would have ascribed it to their emptiness, but after the antecedents I knew Zolema to be quite different.
So she was afraid to be seen with me!
Perhaps she had somebody else!
I looked deeply into her eyes and asked her to tell, me sincerely why she did not want me to go with her.
"Why should you come with me if we do not need each other any more?"
The innocent sincerity with which she said this, to my intense regret, convinced me of the situation.
It partly reassured me, but at the same time it also threw cold water on my earlier belief.
But I did not give in.
I felt that Zolema was the last experiment for me, and I could not let this hand drop.
With heavy heart, I had to revert to the old method, using my Belohin certificate.
I may say I never loathed a piece of paper more than then. This reversed death certificate that certified for the dead the unfortunate fact of my being alive.
But then I still believed it was Zolema in whom I would find everything if I did not lose heart prematurely.
So Zolema remained with me to teach me, and waited for my questions.
And I in turn, drawing my hand through her arm and leading her to the seashore, spoke scintillatingly of the beautiful feeling which in my homeland was called love, and which was the summit of goodness and devotion.
Zolema said that this, in such a form, was a little confused.
I should expound in more detail how devotion manifested itself.
She asked for concrete facts and I, in turn, explained, that due to a rising feeling we gave all that we had to the partner we had found and devoted ourselves completely to her.
This Zolema called a very unfair procedure because - as she said - why should the beloved deserve more from us than others?
I told her in vain that the partner, too, gave us everything she had, and what pleasures were caused by the mutual exchange of gifts. She drew only the conclusion that two people were associating in order to take something from other people and give it to each other.
"It's a mistake to think that," I replied. "The poorest people also do so; they most certainly do not take from anyone else what they give to each other."
To this, however, she answered that there was no point in it, because what would we have gained if she had given me her clothes and I had given her mine.
"The stress is not on the practical value of the objects,", I tried to explain, "but on the love which accompanies them, and which fills our souls with contentment."
"Then I definitely don't understand.
If I ask what is love for, you refer to the giving of things and when I ask why we should give, you revert to love.
But where is the starting point that makes both things logical and necessary?"
I gestured desperately.
"It is essentially himself that the lover gives, and it is love and not sale and purchase."
Zolema became lost in thought.
"Then it is even more incomprehensible.
To give something means that we part with an object which we hand over.
But how could I hand over myself to you and part with my own self?"
"I see you don't understand.
Love is not an equation which can be proved."
"Then why do you deal with it at all?"
"Just because.
The equation would have been solved long ago.
But let me tell you everything.
With us a certain feeling of want, similar to hunger, is innate with man, which makes us sick if we do not satisfy it."
"In the warehouses..."
"Don't interrupt me!
It is not to be found in the warehouses.
It can be given only by you.
Don't look at me in such a surprise, yes, only you can give that.
Because you are good, you stroke my hair, take my arm and talk about all kinds of things."
"Of what do I speak?"
"All kinds of things.
This is our springtime, isn't it?"
"It is summer now."
"But it is spring for us."
"Speech is for communicating existing things.
How could I possibly communicate using it for something which does not exist?"
"But it does.
Perhaps for the moment you do not yet understand, but if you can once come close to me, you will admit it.
Come now, don't jump against my chest so, in itself it has no sense at all.
Everything has to be kindled by itself."
Zolema promised that so far as my recovery depended on her, she would do everything, and asked that I as a physician should describe what she should do and how, about what she should speak and how, and whether it would be possible to work it out in advance for a month that she also should have more time to rest.
"Stop it," I said irritably.
"It must come from inside."
A bitter dissonance mingled with my former, intoxicating, blissful mood, but on the other hand I felt that she did actually love me, though only subconsciously.
How could she know the name of love if she had never heard it?
However, I knew nothing for certain.
She was mysterious, and this seemed to incite me all the more.
Suddenly I felt I would be able to force Zolema to love possibly even with a blow.
To regain my lost mood, I turned off the road with her.
We climbed the rock that hung out over the sea.
On its protruding summit, we settled on the fresh turf.
The silent night was above us, the sea murmured beneath; a mild breeze fanned our faces with its intoxicating salty scent.
Moonflowers shook their heads all around.
There was not another soul in the vicinity, most of the Hins had already gone home.
Zolema's naked leg touched mine; slowly my spirits returned.
Suddenly I embraced her, lifted her, and sat her on my lap.
When my hand brushed her breast I felt that she breathed more impetuously.
Intoxication overcame me again.
Picking a moonflower I put it on her bosom.
She kept silent though her heart beat more quickly.
Stretching my hand towards the moon, softly, with my eyes shut, I commenced to hum the Barcarolle by Offenbach.
No sooner had I sung two or three bars, when Zolema's excited question interrupted:
"Are you perhaps unwell?"
"No.
I am singing."
"What's that?"
Again I became unsettled.
This, too, I had to explain.
But, possibly, there was still some inclination in these people towards the beautiful and noble, only they did not know.
Perhaps I would be able to save a soul from the desert and it would be mine.
I commenced to explain the essence of the song.
I began with the chromatic scale.
She was unable to comprehend what the whole thing meant, why we called musical sounds only those that were in a certain, arbitrarily defined vibrational relation with each other, and what need there was to distinguish the sounds from each other in this way.
And once she understood the essence of music she exclaimed:
"But then it does not even exist!"
This was their general response.
She could not understand why we had created things that did not exist in reality, so that something else could further be created from them.
"What is the point in grouping the sounds according to such contrived rules?" she asked.
"Because music is beautiful."
"And what does beautiful mean?"
"Artistic."
"You equate one meaningless word with another, which, it seems, you need, because none of them has anything to do with reality.
What benefit do you get from the arts?"
"Art is for itself, and the contradiction that art has no reason for existence because it cannot be eaten could only be made by an uneducated person.
If it changed into bread and butter it would not be art any more."
"On the contrary, it is only man that is for himself. Any human creation can only be for man. The uneducated person is one who believes that it is worth bothering with things that exist for themselves, and even to adapt human life to them."
"You only think so because you were not educated in art. You were not imbued with a feeling for it."
"One must be educated only for untruths.
One snatches one's hand from the fire by oneself, and would only believe that a piece of copper is nourishing if one is educated."
Of the tonal scale she considered that it was as if we grew fruit for its scent or wanted to taste the sunray.
Sound is for communicating thoughts, not for continually creating unjustified systems from and building another non-existent storey on top of it, to wit, music; on which we then ruminated and debated as to whether the musical composition in question was in compliance with the rules created by ourselves, which in fact did not exist, as they were only imagined.
I heard her out patiently, let her have her full say. Why, she did not know anything!
When she had finished, I again set about my beautiful soul-building work.
I spoke about musical instruments.
On the violin she heard me out; at the horn, however, she remarked that it seemed to her that we did not know about silencers by which even the most ear-splitting noise could be reduced to a tolerable level.
We were back at the beginning again.
Now I had to bring it home to her that we made music intentionally. This was quite a task.
When she finally understood, she fell into deep thought.
"The noise of the machines in the factory is not enough so you also set up separate noise-making machines?"
I enlightened her that music was not made in the factories,, but after work; from the peaceful parks came the sound of promenade concerts and the enchanting tunes which reinvigorated the heart.
This she simply did not want to believe.
She said that to spoil the refreshing silence of the parks with the noise of machines was as barbaric as if we were to have smoke-generating machines between the bushes instead of enjoying the fresh air.
"So," she said, "you must have moved so far from reality into the mazes made by yourselves that you not only think the non-existent exists, but vice versa."
"What do you mean by that?"
"For instance, that it is better to die than to live, that starvation is pleasant..."
"Don't think such stupidities about us!" I cried but she continued:
"... that the fevered patient should be put on ice, shoes filled with pricking nails, the thirsty offered vitriol, that sexual activity should not be performed whenever we wish and with the person who presents himself and is capable of it, but according to other, fabricated regulations; that society is not for us to eat our fill and live in comfort, but for us to die or suffer privation for it."
In spite of all her coldness and alien manner I still felt love for Zolema more and more.
Slowly I realized that I was hammering with my fists on barren walls but it was at least some exercise for my flaccid brain, which I had yearned after for such a long time, and that was precisely what kindled the flame in me.
Her manner somewhat recalled the coldness feigned by our chaste and well-behaved girls who pretended not to understand and knew that by enhancing the desire in their chosen partner they could induce him to make a proposal.
For this reason I became more and more attracted to her.
She was mine and yet she was not mine so I had to win her, to reach the distant, to open the closed, to chase the fugitive.
At that time I had not yet guessed that among them there was no fugitive, closed or distant.
I also told Zolema my belief to which she replied that for this very reason perfectness remained closed and unattainably distant because we only felt like chasing what was distant and what was unattainable and their existence lasted only until we reached them.
At that very moment, they became unattainable and empty because we ran not for the aim but for the running.
She voiced her suspicion that we also imagined and projected into the distance things that were nearby in order that we could live out our senseless habits in this way.
At that time I still did not believe her. I only felt I had missed something but did not know I had missed it because I had it.
In a roundabout way I tried to acquaint her with the happiness of the heart.
I described what complete and happy satisfaction could be derived from the knowledge that we had a soul-companion with whom we could unite and find understanding.
Zolema listened to me attentively, then asked what understanding was called in our language.
"Because," she said, "if private parts are called understanding, what word expressed understanding itself, and why was it necessary to call something by another name?"
I was astounded.
No words had ever missed their target more than mine.
The Reader who from the foregoing perhaps considers the Hins somewhat strange but basically good-hearted, kind persons, certainly cannot even imagine how many unkind, even coarse features are hidden behind the seemingly clean Aphrodite faces with the high forehead.
I may say, I had not come across many seamen in the dockland pubs of Liverpool who could have matched the weaker sex among the Hins in being outspoken.
I tried to explain that understanding was not what she had thought, but the concept of the union of souls, from which she drew the conclusion that the word "soul" represented our organs.
And when I finally managed to acquaint her with the actual situation she became deeply sorry for our women, who, it seemed to her, were languishing among males who were no more than lunatics, and in response to their desires received only non-existent and stupid phantasms.
"So with you," she said, "if a woman decently and honestly calls upon a man for sexual work, instead of satisfying her according to the justice of the natural world you will talk to her of 'heart', 'affection', 'understanding', 'companionship of the soul', and other nonsense."
These thoughtless words filled me with anger, and it was only my good manners that made me realize that I was faced with a lady.
So I had to content myself with attempting to give a true description of the virtue of our patriotic girls, who - as befitted their good education - first of all look for affection, chivalry and decent character in a man.
I explained that only an uneducated woman might commit such an enormity as to place bodily desires before spiritual things.
After a short while she asked whether my parents belonged to the educated or to the uneducated classes.
Though the question had not been phrased in the most polite form, I tried to explain without any resentment that my good parents were the offspring of the best families, whose good manners were beyond any shadow of doubt.
At this she asked how we multiplied.
Coming to know that it happened in the same way as with anybody else, she again did not understand the beginning. She told me not to continue because the matter was only becoming increasingly confused.
What caused the greatest suffering for me with Zolema, however, was that she never smiled at me.
It was what I would have liked to achieve, and the knowledge of futility and powerlessness filled me with despair.
It was now that I understood the essence of hopeless love: the lover does not actually want one particular woman, but to reach the ideal through her, and that he is not able to win her over to this drives him to impulsive actions.
One question gnawed at me.
I should have come out with it, but I was ashamed.
I felt awkward and childish like one who gives his heart and in the midst of humiliating himself and entreating, receives as the only response from his partner the shock of objective soberness.
I could think only in my own European terms and try to explain such a coldly immediate attachment from a woman, so the Reader cannot be surprised at my imagining other scenery behind the action.
(We cannot imagine the world without scenery and painting.)
It was in this way that jealousy arose in me.
"Maybe she has someone," I thought. "Why, the instinct has not disappeared from them and it is impossible that attraction should not also be present in some form."
We set out homewards.
For a long time I walked beside her in silence.
When we reached the tram stop, the question burst from my lips:
"Tell me, do you have a relationship with somebody?"
"What do you mean by that?"
"A man."
"The tram is coming, let's get on."
So she had secrets which she did not want me to know!
While we were getting on, thousands of suspicions flashed through my mind, I imagined the most adventurous things and decided I would not let her be elusive.
After getting off she would have to confess everything.
And as for Zolema, we had no sooner sat down than she quietly commenced to give me a list of the people with whom she had performed "sexual work", and remarked that she did not remember most of the names as she had not asked them.
Everybody around us could hear her.
I was burning with shame and public humiliation, the words smashed me like so many axes.
I should have liked to disappear from sheer shame, although not a single face turned towards us in the silent tram.
At first I tried to warn her with a wink, but she did not understand this.
I was compelled to ask her not to continue, at which Zolema immediately and without the least surprise fell silent and did not utter another word.
However, when we got off, I blazed forth at her in reproaches.
I openly told her that her behaviour had been most improper and if she wanted to help me she should not do such things again.
Of course, now, she did not understand the beginning.
Why did I ask if I did not wait for an answer, she queried.
Coming to know that I objected only to publicity, she stated that it was now definitely beyond her comprehension as to why she should observe such complicated rules, which made no sense to her, but nevertheless she reconciled herself to the fact that I was a physician, so asked me to prescribe the cure more exactly, what she should do and how, and she would act accordingly.
With this of course the sense of powerlessness became even keener in me, and to avoid further mental blows, I hurriedly took leave of her, asking only to let me meet her every day, to which she agreed.
I did guess something. Why, I had been told openly and plainly several times that for them there was no personality to which individual feelings could be attached, therefore love could not exist, or, to put it another way, their love was not of this world, so I could never reach it.
But at that time I still could not imagine it, as we cannot imagine beings who become warm in the cold, or put on weight as a result of starvation, or lose weight because of eating.
Everything simply appeared illogical and unimaginable. Tossing and turning at night in my bed, I wanted to assemble the factors into a logical, compact and organically connected whole. In vain, because even though a colour-blind person may be persuaded by teaching that colours exist, a real feeling for them will never run in his blood, colours will never be a part of him.
The next day we met again at the beach.
The conversation was slow to start, but I could not keep my feeling to myself.
I complained with excited words that I had not slept.
I asked her to do the things that need to be done at such times to make me feel better, even if she did not know love to stroke me and run her hand through my hair, and above all, not to think of any man except me.
Instead of answering she asked why I had said that love was sympathy while I wanted not to support but to hinder her in life.
Then she expressed her opinion that if we in Europe behaved in such a way towards the beloved woman, we would probably prevent those who were not loved from all sexual work.
These words hurt me deeply.
Trembling with excitement, I asked her not to say such things.
I made a vow to myself to try my best to fill her being entirely, so that finding everything in me, she would settle down and I should make further searching unnecessary for her.
With this, however, she wanted emphatically to disagree.
"You yourself have told me," she said, "that you are ill. So if love is indeed sympathy, you should have supported me in finding a man more perfect than you."
"Silence!" I cried, covering my ears from the inconsiderate words. "You don't understand! You don't understand, so please don't speak about it!"
She, however, replied that, on the contrary, it was her duty to teach the Belohin - otherwise there would be no sense in our being together.
And with this she also began explaining that my behaviour was not only kazi, but I would also have compelled her to act in a kazi way, had I wished her to refuse any: man who might have wanted to perform sexual work with her.
I was unable to control myself.
My lips were trembling. Suddenly, becoming mad, I slapped her on the face with all my strength.
Zolema clutched at her face and looked at me in surprise.
"You!" she said.
"But it is smarting!
Why did you do that?"
I could not bear it any more; I ran away.
Zolema made no attempt to call me back.
I knew, everything between us was over.
I was in a prison with closed walls where I cried in vain and there was no understanding.
I had no idea what might follow.
My brain was torn to a hundred pieces.
I hated Zolema; her loathsome confidence made me furious to an extreme.
In feverish pictures I imagined how I could put her to shame, though I knew it was impossible as their emptiness was invincible.
Then suddenly without any transition I hated myself for not being able to understand the situation and draw the appropriate conclusions and not think of her, or at least not in that way.
I do not know myself whether it was homesickness or the unconscious desire, the passion that compels one to return to the very places which recall the most bitter memories that drove me to the seashore the next day.
And then, unexpectedly, I again caught sight of Zolema.
My heart leapt to my throat and I did not know what to do.
Finally, to avoid shame and an embarrassing situation, I wanted to disappear in a hurry, but she ran after me and called to me to stop.
Blushing all over in shame and embarrassment I stopped and she stated in the most indifferent tone that she had come at the usual time and was at my disposal.
With downcast eyes I asked her in a roundabout way whether she was not angry, and she asked me quietly to explain why I had hit her.
From her voice it could be felt that she was not angry and did not even suppose that I had hit her out of anger.
Anger was kazi for them and they considered it as absurd as if one of our scientists intentionally wrote five in his calculations as being the result of two times two.
He would have been either wrong or a fool.
For them anger was no more understandable a concept than love.
"Why did you slap me?" she asked.
"Because I love you," I answered in a hollow voice.
"Do your people beat those you love?"
With some difficulty I explained that this love is different, from which she drew the conclusion that it seemed she had to remain with me.
This made me very glad, although she had said so because she found it her duty to cure me of my "disease".
After some thought she said that it seemed to her that some error had slipped into my therapeutical course of treatment, as since we had been experimenting with it, my state had not only failed to come closer to the kazo, it had moved even farther away from it.
So I should rely on her and she would acquaint me with "reality," with work, with the laws of the kazo, in brief with healthy things.
She asked me to call upon her in the factory where I would see how interesting creative work was, and how unnecessary it was to deal with such aimless and harmful things.
I myself would certainly have preferred - if I could not see other human beings - to lose my own human characteristics, to become blind and deaf, since with a human heart I could not endure life in this atmosphere.
The next day I found the factory.
It was a long, narrow building from which small auxiliary buildings branched out.
I was led down the corridor of the long building.
Innumerable doors opened one after the other; finally we went through one.
Zolema, who was alone in the room, stood with her back towards me and kept reaching into a trough which extended from the left from the neighbouring room and passed through the wall on the right.
When I arrived she turned and with her rubber-gloved hand beckoned me to step nearer.
As I went forward, my glance fell on the trough and I shuddered.
A male corpse lay inside, partly dissected.
From his head the hair was missing, his mouth was cut up to the ears on both sides so that his lower lip fell on his chest.
All his teeth had been removed and the enormous, gaping mouth with the horrible wounds which remained in place of the teeth looked as if, in an agony surpassing all hells, some apocalyptic howling were bursting from it.
The skin of his body was slit open from his chin right down his whole length; the ribs, the stomach and the intestines were visible.
One of the eyes of the corpse had been removed, while the other looked at me with horror.
I had to turn away.
I grasped Zolema.
"What are you doing here?"
"I am preparing the eye," she said with the same dispassionate objectivity, exactly the same tone that I had always heard here among these wooden people.
"Look at it and listen to me," she continued.
"When someone dies he is delivered here.
This is the corpse processing plant.
First the corpse is observed for three days in order to make sure that it is not a case of suspended animation.
Then it is given a narcotic injection so that if the person were actually still alive he will not awake.
Following this, processing commences.
In the neighbouring building,. hoofed animals are processed, then follows the buildings for birds and for fish.
From the bodies of the animals, food is prepared for the dining-halls.
The department dealing with people is much simpler as there is no slaughterhouse involved because the corpse-crop from the hospitals is delivered here.
Most of the material died from disease or old age, and it is therefore not suitable for consumption, but it is all the more suitable for pharmaceutical and industrial purposes.
As you see, I, too, have been assigned to the human department, and it is my task to take out the eyes and the brain and pass them on to the adjacent building."
"Look," she said, and in spite of all my disgust compelled me to look.
"First I take this small electrically operated rotary hand-saw, now I cut the skin on the temple, opening the bone under it with the saw, like this... and the eye will come out easily after a few cuts.
Previously with a hand-saw this work took five minutes, now the whole process takes three minutes, with less crumbling of the bone, which is a very useful material.
Adhesive and medicine are made from it."
"Just look, this is how an eye should be removed," and taking it into her hand she showed me.
"It has to be finely parted from the motor muscles and the optic nerve should not remain on it."
From Zolema's hand a man looked at me and I became covered with goose-pimples and trembled with horror.
I wanted to escape but no sooner was I about to express my feelings when she continued:
"You, of course, wonder what the eye is used for.
I'll tell you.
You see, I put it on this belt, now I push this button, the belt starts, the eye disappears through the wall and passes on to the next room where it is collected into a container.
The container is emptied daily and a chemist processes the contents, that is he extracts from the vitreous body the material which, when mixed into the food of people suffering from lack of appetite, cures them."
"And do they know what it is made from?"
"Of course they do.
Everybody learns such elements of natural science at school."
"And does it restore their appetite?"
"Yes.
It's a very efficient remedy.
But just listen!
Most parts of the corpse are used for transplantation to the sick.
In the liver, however, a great many useful materials are stored, which in the form of injections restore an organ racked by disease.
In addition, the skin is processed by industrial means, excellent string is made from the entrails, soap and food-preparation extract are manufactured from the fat, and as for the brain..."
I could bear it no longer.
I interrupted:
"And you perform it so calmly?
Doesn't it turn your stomach?"
"A ventilator operates above my head," she said and pointed upwards.
"Where the bowels are processed they even get gasmasks."
I looked with horror at this person who allegedly was a woman.
"Is this how you appreciate Man?" I asked in a muffled reproachful tone.
"Yes," she said proudly.
"Not a single atom is lost.
And how is your processing carried out?"
I related the funeral rites, the mourning of the family, the black clothes, the tears, the priest, the horse-drawn hearse, the bell-ringer, the coffin and burial, the memorial stone, and the pious annual commemoration when the bereaved place flowers and possibly a candle on the tomb of the beloved relative.
It was very difficult to explain, and when I had said everything I could see she still did not understand fully.
While I was speaking she didn't cease interrupting me with her questions.
She thought the bell was some sort of attempt to revive the dead, the priest she considered a physician. She continually looked for some purpose: why did they cut the flowers, as they would wither and therefore could not fruit.
Why did we use a candle on the grave when electric lights were better?
Why did we not mourn in white in the summer, and if we had to wear black who and what was it good for-the dead, the priest or the relatives, and how?
I described the funeral three times but she kept on shrugging her shoulders in puzzlement.
"What is the aim?" she asked about everything.
I explained that it was to pay one's respects to the dead.
"In the dead there are only chemical values," she answered, "which you do not respect but throw away, apart from the fact that as the interred is in one piece, he is exposed to the possibility of the painful fate of apparent death.
It is just you who do not respect your dead."
"It is not the chemical value that we respect, but that he used to live, he was a man who worked, loved, and was of benefit to others!" I cried.
"Again you are doing things which do not exist, and even these back to front.
A man's work is to be respected while he is alive, by repaying him with good nourishment, a flat, clothes and comfort in accordance with the kazo equilibrium.
But as you yourself have said, you have people who are very badly off although they are working, in fact those who work the hardest.
So you do not respect Man either in life or in death according to his merits."
I saw terrible gulfs developing between us which I would never be able to bridge.
Slowly I looked differently on her.
Yet only yesterday her perfect human form, even her beauty, had misled me, but now I began to regard her as a moving automaton.
I understood that I had to deal with human bodies only, in which, however, there was not even a trace of humanity. They could be termed thinking objects, and now, finally, I fully realized that neither Zolema nor the others were some special type of humans - they simply were not people.
They were completely different.
Now it became clear to me where the soul was for which I had looked in vain.
Nowhere!
It was only now that I understood that there the soul could be completely absent.
But who were, or properly speaking, what were these around me?
And what was it that maintained their society?
I asked only out of curiosity:
"Why didn't you choose a more womanly job?"
"Why, isn't that what I'm doing?" she asked in surprise.
"Once I was sent to the day-nursery out of necessity, because there were not enough male workers.
I lifted beds, carried buckets of water, took the dirty linen to the laundry, and used the, hoses to clean with just like the strongest men, but I could not stand it for long.
I consulted the doctor, who stated that I was not fit for such work and I had to do some womanly job, whereupon I took up my present duties here."
While Zolema was speaking, she receded into an incredible distance.
At first I could see two objects: Zolema and the gaping corpse in front of her, which already had no eyes.
Then the two became increasingly blurred and the difference between them faded.
I announced briefly that I had learned enough, I required no more, and left.
I did not thank her for her trouble, neither did I take leave of her as both courtesies were in any case unknown to them.
Nevertheless I looked back from the doorway.
Zolema stood with her back to me and continued working as if she had never seen me.
At the moment she had accomplished her task assigned to her by the kazo in connection with me, nothing further connected her with me.
As if I had never existed.
People who work ten or fifteen years near to each other are able to live in that way, without developing the slightest relationship.
In the morning they enter without greeting each other and get down to work, at noon they leave, and if after ten or fifteen years one of them moves, they disappear from each other's life without saying good-bye.
A feeling of terrible powerlessness came over me.
I was buried alive among the dead in this island in the suffocating atmosphere of which the life-thirsty lung panted in vain.
And there was no escape.
I was to wither away here, without air and life to be carried off in the end to Zolema who would, quite unperturbed, cut out my eyes, the smile and tears of which had meant only something exotically unfamiliar for her, and that my body should continue its journey in the trough until dissected and classified by the chemists into "useful" materials on the basis of the kazo.
And no memory would stir in Zolema even then; why, their own fathers and mothers, their ancestors were unknown strange objects who were or had been, but with whom there was not a thread of contact.
The air lay weightily on me; I almost suffocated.
A fit of dizziness came over me.
With a single jerk I tore my clothes open at the neck and staggered.
I caught at the door-post.
Zolema knew that I was there, but it did not even occur to her to turn.
Everyone is convinced that everyone else acts properly and expediently and has no interest in them unless someone speaks.
The world began to spin with me, and my feet failed.
I snatched at the back of a chair but in vain.
Together with the chair I fell full length on the floor.
She had already turned on hearing the noise.
With a jump she was beside me.
"Are you unwell?" she asked.
"No!
Leave me!" I shrieked.
"Leave me alone!
Get away!
All of you get away!
Let me rot away alone!"
She stood puzzled.
She took a few steps, then turned back to me.
Finally seeing my tears and distorted face she said, "You must be unwell.
Why do you claim things that are not in reality?"
(They had no word for telling a lie.)
After hesitating briefly she threw off her overall with a swift movement and after a few seconds she came running back with two companions.
One of them took over her work, while she and the other lifted me up with a gentleness of which no man of feeling would have been capable.
Holding their breath they carried me to the yard.
A car was already standing there and they hoisted me into it.
Zolema sat near me, undid my clothes over my chest, poured some tonic or other into my mouth and we set off.
After two minutes we stopped where two men were waiting for us with a stretcher.
With great care they lifted me out and carried me to a special tram-car waiting there.
This was the ambulance car.
I sank deeply into the rubber bed they made me lie on and we moved away, I only realized this, however, by looking out of the window as no noise could be heard and no movement could be felt.
Zolema stood close by and bent over me, watching all of my movements with anxiety; and I was again shedding tears.
I half lifted my arms towards her, I wanted to hold her to me, but my arms fell back.
It would have been in vain anyway.
It was horrifying to see people around me and to know that everything was illusory; that affection was not affection, goodness was not goodness, the bodies were devoid of content and I was all alone.
A wild, impotent sobbing shook me and tears flooded down my face.
She brought cotton wool and blotted them up.
Then she turned on a tap from which emanated some refreshing air, rich in ozone.
In ten minutes we reached the hospital.
Here again I was awaited by stretcher, carried upstairs by lift, and put to bed.
A physician stepped forward.
Zolema reported where I had been brought from, mentioning that I was a Belohin, then added:
"In case of death attach the diagnosis stating whether the brain can be used or whether it should be discarded."
She turned and left.
I never saw her again.
Sobs choked me but I did not dare to weep.
I said I had been overcome by an attack of giddiness and that I already felt well. To prove it, I gathered all my strength and got up.
The physician examined me, administered a spoonful of extremely evil-smelling oil, and sent me over to the Belohin department where I went to bed.
CHAPTER EIGHT
Author suffers from homesickness and complains bitterly to Zatamon - Zatamon makes strange statements concerning author's country who, however, proves the rectitude of European culture - Zatamon speaks about the Behins who now appear much more attractive to author - He asks to be led among the Behins
I think it would be almost needless to say that I could hardly sleep that night.
My disappointments and the desire for life filled me with infinite bitterness.
Day was already dawning when exhaustion sent me to sleep.
Strange and confused dreams troubled me.
I was hovering, with big, soft balls hanging near me in space, and they were weightless.
I struggled ceaselessly with some word, but I no longer know what it was.
I awoke late in the afternoon.
My hair was wet and matted, and my bed-clothes were soaked with perspiration.
I stood under the shower, but even this could not calm me down.
I put on my clothes and for a moment I thought that perhaps I should get some fresh air into my lungs by going out to the street.
But I soon gave up that idea, too.
The very thought of their streets filled me with nausea.
And it was all the same, anyway, whether my prison consisted of twenty square metres or fifty square kilometres.
The kind of atmosphere necessary for my mind was not to be found anywhere there.
I returned to my room.
Absent-mindedly I pushed the call-button for food. The little table popped out of the wall with my afternoon snack on it.
I could only manage a few bites.
The silence and the woolly emptiness of time got on my nerves.
I started up from my seat, charged to and fro for a while and then exhaustedly threw myself down on my bed without knowing what to do.
This was the time when Zatamon entered.
He was the only one for whom it was an official duty to be interested in all my troubles (if I may use the word duty here at all), the only one to whom I could show myself in my true light. And I had never needed so badly to unburden my soul to somebody as now.
No sooner had he come in and set himself near my bed than I snatched his hand, dissolved into tears, without the least restraint, and entreated him to hear me out.
Zatamon reassured me that he had treated many similar patients already, and though he himself as a sound organism was not able to appreciate the symptoms completely, he did nevertheless, in relation to the then existing state of medical science, know my malady quite well and knew that at such times the patient had to be reassured about his good intentions, as in his mind erroneous beliefs were forming.
He had had dealings with more than one patient, who attributed Behin properties to the physician, as their brain had been disturbed by the strange current which I called fear, and such a patient even did such things as to assert that things were not as they were in reality.
"It is a strange and hitherto unaccountable matter," he said, "about which it is necessary for me to enlighten you.
Speech, as we know, is for communication, and only existing things can be communicated.
They, however, forget at such times why speech has come about, and try to use it to communicate non-existent things, like someone wanting to see with his ears or make light with a typewriter."
Seeing my confused face he assured me firmly that it had indeed occurred during his practice.
But I needed no encouragement to be sincere.
What did I care now if they took me for a madman!
It could not be worse among the lunatics!
Throwing off every self-tormenting shackle I cried and, choking with sobs, almost shrieking, I unburdened my soul.
"Are you telling me to be sincere?" I asked.
"You, who did nothing else but compel me to tell lies?!
I assure you, however, that it is over, and I won't conceal my soul any more!"
Zatamon listened with an unchanging wooden expression and I continued freely.
"Be informed then that I am indeed ill!
And if you really do have good intentions, then on this occasion don't try to stop me with stupidities; instead try to understand and help me!"
"I understand everything."
Yet again the comforting words were such a peculiar contrast to his hollow voice, but for me even this morsel was a great, liberating gift which, relieving me of my fetters, brought forth a volley of words from me.
"You are the only man who takes an interest in my fate, so let me tell you everything that weighs heavily on me.
I am not actually angry with you, but I still hate you because you have deprived me of everything.
Oh, don't interrupt me, don't tell me that everything was at my disposal in the warehouses.
What you have taken away you have not taken by hand, but simply by not even touching the victim!
Indifference was the most terrible dagger with which you have driven me away from Life, and this is why I hate you, although I am not an enemy but merely different from you, and cannot tear out my soul.
The whole of my being would have to be changed, for me not to perish in your airless, frosty world, after human cultural life."
Burying my face in my hands, I calmed down a little and continued:
"I'm afraid I cannot bear this icy jail for long!"
So that he might understand me better, I spoke of the British citizen's variegated and colourful life, of the first motherly kiss, of the sweet games of childhood, about college life, harmless jokes, sports, the beautiful daydreams so full of colour, about the sweet, sunny years of budding love, about the happiness which came from the knowledge of bread won by hard work, the family house, the "my own", about the pleasures of the warm, soft nest, where in the evening beside the crackling fire the child is dandled on his father's knee-the child in whom the happy parents saw the continuation of their lives, they petted and reared him like the gardener the sapling. The head of the family saw that his life had been worth while, knowing that when he died, his name and memory would survive and be enshrined in the hearts of his grandchildren, who would come to his grave at least once a year to tend the flowers with loving hands and to offer a prayer for him.
I spoke of the struggle of social ideas, the debates of the philosophers, scientists and politicians, of the life-forming force of the homeland, the card-games in cordial friendly circles, the elegant balls, I spoke about the interesting details of social life, the colourfulness of the streets, about the monuments erected in honour of great people by grateful posterity, about competitions, theatre, literature, everything which could be summed up under the terms of fine human culture, and all of which I had to do without here.
"Oh, I am aware, only too well," I said bursting out passionately, "that there is very much trouble, misery and inequality in our world.
I have been watching your country with open eyes and have to admit that in many respects you are perfect.
And I have no wish to complain about having to dispense with what is bad with us but rather to say what is good.
What a person of culture cannot endure is that you live without heart, without the salt and sense of life; his life becomes intolerable, and he dies of thirst.
For what is the point in living in order just to linger from one day to the other with no aim?
Tell me," I shouted, almost beside myself, "what is the sense in it?"
"Do you call life lingering?" he interrupted.
"Does man not live for life?"
But I was not to be stopped.
"... to die at the end like a dog, to be processed..."
"Do you not die?"
"...and to be cleared away, without having lived, without having had anything to live for..."
"As I see it," he said, "you do not know the essence of life, the life."
"Oh!" I broke in.
"Don't repeat that!
I have heard that nonsense so often already!
And anyway it makes no difference, I am fed up with it!
I would rather have no more of this life!
I will not sink to the level of a robot, look at the sea after a monotonous job, then go home and go to bed; never to be able to talk to anyone, not to love, not to feel enthusiasm, not to struggle for some aim.
I can't endure such a complete vacuum, do you understand?
That really can't be treachery, can it?
That really can't be kazi, can it?
This is the red colour of life, without which there is no sense.
No, because it is not life.
Of everything we do, you say that it really does not exist. On the contrary, nothing that you do exists!
At last I had come across the expression I wanted: that is what is not: it is your life that simply does not exist!"
Zatamon looked for a long time at my excited, heaving chest, and then seeing that I had finished he began to speak quietly.
"I am a physician, so I'm not surprised at your words.
Those who imagine of nothing that it is something, can do it only if at the same time they see the existent as non-existent.
The camera records what is white and black, and the picture is visible only because at the same time black appears as white.
If the camera took everything in black we would see nothing."
I was astonished.
These profound words bewildered me.
Maybe our approach was a similarly complete whole such as theirs?
Two worlds, which could never perceive each other simply because the other was not a separate entity but the reverse of itself...
I remembered, when I first heard that the earth was a sphere I wondered why it was that the American children did not fall off the earth, and no doubt American children thought the same about us, because we did not know that in reality there was no up and down.
But then...
Suddenly I spoke.
"All right.
It is possible.
But if you know only that we each live in opposite outlooks what evidence is there that yours is the positive and ours the negative?
We are unable to penetrate into each other's concept of the world. But surely it can be seen that we are both able to live, however impossible it may appear from the other's point of view."
"Yours is the negative," he answered.
"Where is the evidence?"
"It is not difficult to decide which is the negative between something which is and something which is not."
"Speak more clearly!
Why do you say that it is not we who live reality?"
"With you existing things are only a means for reaching non-existent aims which you call ideas while it is precisely the reverse that can be called reality: when we think of bringing about something in fact.
Only an aim taken from the real, the natural world can be termed positive, as only what exists can be achieved.
But you don't live for building a house, for producing clothes and food, and even if you accomplish all this, you do it for imaginary - and therefore unattainable - aims."
"But a house is built and in the oven bread is baked.
Does it make any difference for what aim all this takes place?"
"It does. The result of a negative endeavour can only be a negative life."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Negative life is death.
And is that not how all your activities end?
Did you not conclude in every case that for the faith, the flag, love, beauty, that is for the words, one had not to live but to die?
But to build houses one must live, and a dead man cannot reap the cornfields."
A lengthy silence ensued, and then, softly, I began to speak.
"You may be partly right, but you cannot say that we don't live a real life.
What I've related to you about the life of the inhabitants of my country, mostly takes place in the world which is also called real by you and for tangible aims.
Or does the student not learn in order to become a bread-winner some day in the future, and is it not the kiss in which love ends?"
"No.
This is also imaginary.
You fight as if you wanted to reach something, and when you have reached it, you are still farther from it.
The student lives in his dreams and the loving youth in his desires; but if the student realizes his dreams or the youth wins his love then they are no longer satisfied.
It is then necessary for them to sire a child to be brought up giving yet another unattainable aim, or some sense into his life.
Ends already attained you consider senseless, and the fullness of life you term lifelessness.
But then why do you strive to reach it?
When you are far from something, you force your way towards it, you redouble your efforts, and when you have it, you throw it away, as it has then lost its value."
"And you? Why do you work?"
"For life itself.
And you for the struggle.
Once you told me what a pleasure it was for you to solve puzzles, and if you happened to come across the magazine in the club with the riddles already solved by someone else, you felt vexed, instead of being pleased.
You mentioned that a trend in poetry or art was beautiful until the meaning of the metaphors became well known.
As soon as you become accustomed to iron meaning strength, and spring meaning youth, you no longer consider them beautiful.
The target is always moved farther and farther away because you fight for the fight itself not for the goal.
And you also told me that for a diamond you would give everything as there are only a few of them, while air had no value, although this is what is necessary and not the former.
You fight for the love of a woman as if it did not depend on the woman alone whether she loves you or not."
"That is precisely what we fight for," I replied in surprise, "because it depends on her and not on us."
"But a woman is also a human being, so you fight for a thought in a human brain, the existence of which depends solely on your imagination.
You lay siege to the walls drawn on a map just as if it were not you yourselves who had drawn them.
You heal wounds inflicted by yourselves in order to be able to wound again, and you struggle against an economic crisis as if it was not you yourselves who stopped the machines.
You have invented friendship, beauty, love, hatred, which create obstacles for you to have something to struggle for or to fight against, as you attribute independent existence to these obstacles."
"And is it not variety that gives meaning to life?
In the village do we not long for the town so that we can be delighted by the thousand varieties of society?
Are the arts not for making life more tolerable?
And is faith not for relieving anguish, to give substance and purpose to our life, without which only a barren skeleton and an unfilled gap would exist between birth and death?"
"Whoever wants to come out of the water must reach for the shore and not at himself.
Progress can be achieved only by reaching for the real world."
"Oh, I know very well that for you only matter and wellbeing exist.
But realize that we also reach for the shore.
Many of our philosophers are working for the enlightenment of man and searching for the governmental system which will set as its target progress towards eternal peace and a just material life."
I told him about Plato's state, Saint Thomas Aquinas's principles of the divine universality of the outcome of labour, the common work of the Cathari and the Hussites, Fourier's phalansteries, Thomas More's Utopia, Proudhon's people's bank, Louis Blanc's national workshops, Robert Owen's social manufacturing plants, the communal states of the Dominicans and Jesuits in South America, and finally I came to scientific socialism and the latest theories, to the plans of Marx, Lenin, Bakunin, Bernstein, Kropotkin, Kautsky and Plekhanov, and to technocracy and the democratic socialism of the Fabian Society, Wells and the Webbs.
I spoke of the work theory of mercantilism and physiocracy, of the liberalism of Adam Smith, and of the trade unions; nor did I fail to mention the ideas that had not materialized, such as Georgism, syndicalism and anarchism.
For his life he could not understand how it was possible to imagine so many things concerning such a simple thing as life.
"Only the words and the names of the theories can be varied," he countered. "Not life itself, which is predetermined by our organism.
And anyone who attributes independent life to the words, is sick and a somnambulist."
"But from these words economic systems are born," I retorted.
"Is it not all the same in which system you are ill?
Even then your soul will remain, which is what draws you away from natural life."
"How can you say that?
Emotion is our innate, natural property.
Go all over the world and you will not find a single group of people without faith, art, love and hatred."
"Well, is that not what I have said-that you are basically sick, so words and enlightenment will not cure you?
You are dreaming, and talk in vain to each other about what is good, because you also dream the concept of good and your philosophers, too, are no more than figures in a dream.
You will always remain in one place and struggle with yourselves.
Your life is a stagnant, dreary drudgery, for drudgery itself, in which there is no progress but the infinite, dull monotony which any man wishing to make progress could not, with a sound mind, tolerate."
I was astonished at the audacity with which he was able to impute all the deficiencies of their life so cynically and unscrupulously to ours.
"So, according to you, superior aims have no reason to exist?"
"Among men there are no aims beyond Man, furthermore, there cannot be."
"None beyond Man, only superior ones.
Or does literature not deal with the human fate and reality?"
"All of your life is imaginary.
And if you write of this imagined life a story which is itself imagined, you stray only farther from reality."
"But it refines our taste.
It gives new content, new aims and clearer sight to our mind.
But let things be according to your opinion.
Let us presume that we did not progress in the things called real by you, and wasted our energies on spiritual aims.
One thing you cannot deny: in this we did make progress, as culture has constantly led to new problems, new styles, new manners and new tastes.
Or don't you see any development from Plato to Marx, from Pheidias to Rodin?
Is not spiritual life more developed today than two thousand years ago?"
"You are building a rotating cage for yourself, which leads you to imagine intentionally infinite horizons lest recognition should spoil the illusion of your long-distance running."
Somberly I remarked that it seemed that I could not rely on a spark of understanding on his part, yet at the outset he had stated that he would understand everything.
"By understanding you mean approval, whereas sickness can be approved only by misunderstanding, by the inability to recognize the heart of the matter."
With a tired wave of the hand I fell silent and decided not to continue.
However, prompted by a sudden inspiration, I gave a start.
"Perhaps," I said in a more lively tone, "perhaps, if we wanted just to exist on the earth, we ought to emulate you.
But tell me, what shall we do with our heart now that we have it?"
"Why do you use the name of something that actually exists as a designation of something which does not exist?"
But now I felt that God had delivered him into my hands, and I regained my l dance.
Backing two steps and putting my hands on my hips I hurled it into his face:
"Because it is!
Because it exists!"
"What does not exist in nature does not exist at all."
"Tell me," I said acrimoniously, "why do you eat?"
"Because we are hungry."
"Why do you drink?
Why do you sleep?
Because you are thirsty and sleepy, isn't that so?"
"It is so."
"Thus, after all, you, too, live in order to satisfy desires, and these desires are in you, that is they are in men, and therefore in nature.
Do realize," I went on in a raised tone, "that we are driven to culture by the same feeling of want.
If this desire is for words, then we subsist on words, but the fact that a thirst is quenched not by water, but by music, love or enthusiasm only confirms its existence."
"But a word is not a reality..."
"That's not important!" I interrupted.
"The point is that we do have such desires!"
"There are only existing things in the world."
Airily I waved my hand.
I had never been so sure of myself.
I almost found pleasure in stabbing my words into him.
"If I said about your eating and drinking that they are nonsensical, I would be more justified because we know material desires as well, but you haven't the least of cultural needs.
This particular desire is our property only while it is missing from you, so in this respect we are more than you.
Yes, we are more, because what you have, we have as well, but you have only part of our senses.
How dare a colour-blind person claim that there are only coarse and smooth surfaces but there is no colour?"
"Dreams cannot be reality," he reiterated stubbornly, "a dream is a self-created picture of the brain..."
"Look here, you say that no desire aiming at anything other than existence can exist.
But in me, such a desire does exist, and I say that its being is possible.
What does that prove?"
Zatamon was attentively watching my face.
After a short while he said:
"That you are a Behin."
At first, I wanted to fling myself at his throat.
How dare he offend me, a British citizen, in such an arrogant manner.
It took me minutes, thinking over the nature of the Hins to curb my passion.
The mind accustomed to the animated European atmosphere can hardly but realize that among them there is neither offending nor flattering intention, purely and simply the objective meaning of words.
"You are a Behin!"
He uttered these words as if he had examined litmus in a test-tube and said, "It is an acid".
Gathering myself together I tried to think of the essence of the former words and suddenly it flashed through my mind that, accordingly, the Behins could be nothing other than people blessed with a soul, whose misunderstanding of these eating automatons resulted in their exclusion from the Hins' world.
It could only be that the madmen took soundness for insanity.
"Look here," I said with interest, "what is Behinity actually?"
"It is a mental disorder which regrettably has not so far been cured; we only know its cause for the time being."
"Tell me, what is the essence of it?"
"For that, I have to explain the natural metabolism of the brain generated by the sun's cosmic rays."
"How?"
"It is known that cosmic rays emanate from the sun while the brain operates as an aerial and operates for the aim of life when it is affected by these rays, which you call 'natural instincts'.
In nature there is no contradiction as everything that exists has developed by itself during billions of years, and the rough edges of the components of the overall mechanism have been worn down to work smoothly together.
So the cosmic rays of the sun induce the functioning of natural life through the aerial of the brain.
But we know that the receivers, according to their size, also generate self-oscillation, become auto-excited and with a lack of proper shielding these oscillations also affect the aerial which therefore accepts distorted waves.
The apparatus squeals, crackles and roars because it is reproducing its own voice.
With small apparatus it cannot be felt, as the small brain of an animal does not disturb itself, and the animal lives its natural life.
With animals possessing a more developed brain neurosis manifests itself quite obviously in some cases..."
"Speak of the Behins!" I interrupted impatiently.
"The Behins' brain is completely influenced by its self-oscillation: so their life is directed not by natural but by artificial aims coming from within.
These inside phantasmagoric waves turn life into its reverse which sometimes results in its elimination.
Yet today they are experimenting with a cure, but the whole brain needs to be removed and as this is very dangerous, it has not as yet been tried out on human beings.
So, for the time being, we cannot do too much for the poor fellows, only leave them alone and see to it that they should not go short of anything."
While listening to his words I could hardly keep from smiling.
Before my very eyes there was this tiny unseeing man gabbling away and officiously explaining what can cause the obsession of colours and how it was to be cured.
"But still, what do the Behins actually do?"
"Non-existing things.
Speech is fit for communicating only existing things so I could not even tell you the essence of them, but this much I can definitely say-their deeds are very similar to yours.
There is, for example, one who paints his shoes saying that it increases their usefulness, while on the contrary it covers over the pores of the material so that the feet cannot be aired.
They do not dress in the clothes as they are made by our factory, but before doing so they alter them, each in a different way with a lot of senseless work."
I felt the former greatness of Zatamon diminish into nothing.
I no longer even paid attention to his words, I was interested only in how I could get among the Behins to shake with tearful eyes the hands of my poor, outcast, zealous fellow-men.
"Where are the Behins?" I asked.
He related that they lived behind the hospital in a spacious settlement, encircled by a wall.
They lived within the enclosure in normal flats; the Hins provided them with food and clothes, but otherwise they lived completely according to their own incredible system.
The Behins, however, not only endured each other's company: they were, in fact, unable to live outside it.
Internment was not therefore a punishment, of which concept the Hins were unaware, but merely the separation desired by both sides.
"How can I get in there?" I asked.
My question somewhat surprised Zatamon, and he anxiously warned me of the "madnesses" to which one was exposed among the "crazy people" which could not be tolerated by the sound mind.
He remarked that they took in people only in very grave cases and that perhaps it would be better to experiment with some other cure for the time being, as maybe "there was still hope".
I, however, claimed I felt myself to be completely hopeless and demanded to be taken among the Behins.
"Be warned also," he continued, "that on no account do we intervene in the Behins' life, so if you suffer from their crazinesses we cannot help you."
Smiling, I reassured him that I fully agreed to the principle of non-intervention, and stated that I was not afraid of anything. He consented, and said that he would take me to the Behin settlement the next day, if possible, but first he had to study my symptoms carefully.
With this he brought a syringe, took blood from my arm, cut a sample of my hair and then left me alone.
For my own part, I spent the night sleeplessly - but now it was from joy.
Before my soul, parched in the desert of the Hins, the long lost hope of warm, colourful human life dawned with an ever brightening red glow.
Oh, had I only known what was to come!
PART TWO
GULLIVER AMONG THE BEHINS
CHAPTER NINE
We arrive at the gravest days of author's adventurous journey, spent among the Behins - The oddities of the first day
The next day Zatamon visited me again and advised that the matter had been thoroughly discussed. They had obtained the opinion of the casualty doctor, interrogated Zolema, carried out blood and hair-tests and as a result of all this there was no objection to my going among the Behins.
His words somewhat surprised me and I even remarked that I was astonished at this severity as it was not usual for the Hins to try to influence individual decisions and everybody acted as he thought fit.
Zatamon replied that this was the only wish which could not be complied with according to the individual's will because-as he said-there were mental patients who imagined themselves Behins while their case was only "simple" paranoia, which was curable, and their belief was nothing more than one of the usual obsessions; for example they would imagine themselves to be a corkscrew or made of glass.
Such milder cases should not be exposed to the grave disturbances of life among the Behins, and it was purely with regard to the seriousness of the consequences that they had examined my particular case so scrupulously.
His words again made me smile and I reassured him that I would withstand the encounter.
At this he stood up and we set off.
We crossed the park and soon we came to a big wall.
At the gate we had to ring.
This was the first door on which I saw a lock.
To my question he replied that many strange things took place among the Behins.
They did not use things for the purpose for which they had been made. They asked for unnecessary things, which they were usually given, as there were cases when, if the request was refused, the Behin's face became distorted, his voice resembled a turkey's, and he began shouting even though one was standing quite near him.
On such occasions they quite unnecessarily broke fragile objects, and sometimes even hit someone without being asked to do so.
This perhaps meant a more serious stage of the sickness.
It was for this -reason that such a mechanism was needed on the door, as this had the property of allowing it to be opened by a suitable device.
No sooner had the door opened than he took the key out of the door-keeper's hand and explained its operation, remarking that it had been designed by the technical department of the hospital.
Smiling to myself I listened to his words and excitedly awaited the prospect of meeting my first Behin.
Oh, had I only known. I was to get into the most terrible bedlam in the world, that a chapter of my life was to commence to which I would not be able to look back even now without my heart being twisted by the memory of the sufferings and monstrosities!
We entered a long corridor.
In a window-recess a man was standing in a rather shabby-looking suit of clothes.
In these clothes several holes gaped, and some parts hung in rags.
On our arrival he watched with furrowed brows, put his forefinger on his nose and turned after us.
"You see," said Zatamon, "there is a cut in the middle of his head."
Frightened, I looked back, but saw only a hair-style parted in the middle, which caused me definite pleasure.
He led me into a room in which there were a bed, table, chair and a wardrobe.
Most of them in the wall.
Then he left me alone.
When I looked round my first impression was that although the furniture of the flat was quite decent, everything was considerably more worn than with the Hins.
On certain pieces I even believed I could find definite traces of wilful damage.
A big electric cooker was in a particularly deplorable state.
Its plates were battered, half of its switches broken, its legs not complete, one being replaced by a brick.
But all this was for the moment of no interest to me.
I wanted to get acquainted with my new country.
I went to the yard.
I was faced with a vast area surrounded partly by a stone wall and partly by buildings.
The end of this area could not even be seen from there.
Somewhere in the background a shrub-covered hill rose, otherwise it was a huge area with grass and trees, with paths here and there, and a few benches.
It was pleasant, sunny weather, and there were a lot of people wandering about.
It was here that I saw people in groups for the first time.
Their clothes, too, were in a similarly ragged state which I then attributed to the tight-fistedness of the Hins.
Under one of the trees a man placed glasses on a table, and pouring varying amounts of water into each, hammered out a tune on them.
The others surrounded him, sang and - laughed!
After the terrible emptiness it was a veritable recreation for me.
Can it be possible... With my heart throbbing with joy I ran to them.
I caught one of them.
"I am Gulliver," I said freely, smiling and offering my hand.
"Pricc-prucc," said he and put his forefinger on his nose.
Such words I did not know - they could not even occur in the Hin language where neither the letter "r" existed nor could two consonants come immediately after each other.
A shiver of horror went through me.
So was he mad, too?
He seemed to be so nice only a minute ago!
What should I do now?
If I were to run away he might get into a fury.
As for him, seeing my embarrassment, he suddenly and without the least transition began to laugh.
The hysterical laugh froze the blood in my veins; trembling, I looked towards the gate which, however, had closed irrevocably behind me.
In my confusion I looked for some way of reassuring him; for some reason for having addressed him.
"I only wanted to ask," I said, "when we shall eat."
The smile suddenly froze on his lips and he turned his back to me.
The others, too, contemptuously turned their backs on me.
Utilizing this moment I hurriedly took to my heels.
For a while I looked around and tried to find an opportunity to start a conversation with a more decent sort of person as I had in some way to acquaint myself with my strange environment.
I did not even know what the dangers were, and to what extent I was exposed to them.
In my mind, I gravely reproached Zatamon for having brought me here like this without an informative word.
Although it was also true that if people with a soul really lived here, the Hins would not have been able to inform me anyway.
I realized that I was thrown back on my own resources and I had to find out something about them at any rate.
On a bench there was somebody reading a book.
Hesitating briefly, I accosted him.
"Do I disturb you if I ask something?"
Placing his finger on his nose he said, "Pricc-prucc," and smiled.
So. This one, too.
My knees were knocking.
I stood there puzzled.
The smile froze from his lips, too, and he turned away.
But I had to talk to them for I knew nothing and was exposed to the greatest uncertainty.
"I have just been brought in," I said entreatingly.
"I am uninitiated.
Please answer me."
At this he suddenly became more friendly and turned to me.
"Ah!
I didn't know.
Then, of course, the case is different.
Everything is kvari.
I see.
So I shall teach you.
Pricc-prucc is belki."
"What?" I was stupefied.
"Belki," he said cold-bloodedly while I was looking for a way of escape.
"You, of course, don't understand it, as you don't know what the ketni is."
"Ketni?"
"Ketni.
If they say pricc-prucc you must return it by putting your finger on your nose because with us it is the belki.
If you don't do so, you don't behave in a ketni way, and of course they will enoate because of you."
"Enoate?"
"Well?
Shouldn't they enoate if someone doesn't behave in a ketni manner?"
"Of course, of course," I said soothingly, "and what's that?"
"Ah, I see, you don't even know that either.
Well, the way I plunged back into my book showed that I was inwardly enoating because of you.
Be careful! You may expose yourself even to being hit if you are not ketni."
"If I don't say pricc-prucc?"
"Of course!
Why are you surprised at it?"
"And if I say pricc-prucc?"
"Then they will smile at you, scratch your posterior at which you scratch theirs in turn.
This indicates that neither of you is enoating because of the other and that both of you are ketni."
"Well, that's nonsense!" I snapped.
He frowned.
"Watch your tongue, and don't speak about the ketni like that as you may be exposed to the greatest enoa.
I kvari your behaviour because you have just arrived, but you will learn the ketni which makes us superior to the bivak mob outside."
"Bivak?"
"Bivak.
Because they behave like a bivak.
If we belki to them they pay no attention to us either; even if we scratch their posterior they gaze at us idiotically.
They are all idiots.
From first to last!
And they haven't the foggiest idea of the ketni."
With this he scratched my posterior and I had to scratch him back to prove the sanity of my mind!
Slowly the horrible reality dawned on me.
The Reader is likely to be most annoyed at the many Behin words, charging me with negligence or even bumptious ostentation for not presenting them directly in English translation.
And it is for this reason that I have to remark here and now that the untranslated words have no equivalent in the English language.
They indicate special fixed ideas which simply do not exist in our culture.
As illustration, let the Reader imagine that somebody has pricked his finger, snatches it and puts it in his mouth.
This gesture has a normal English name: pain.
But if somebody places his finger on his nose, for no apparent reason, and calls it belki, how am I to translate it into the language of the sober citizens of my country?
Now another man was approaching the bench.
He cut a strange figure, poor fellow.
Above each of his knees a heavy copper cube hung on a chain which painfully knocked against his legs at every step, so he could only walk very slowly.
I felt sorry for him.
My acquaintance suddenly jumped up, lifted his right foot with one hand and with a painful face he wailed towards him:
"Vake!
Vake!"
The man stopped, and with an infinitely grave grimace shook the copper cubes on his legs, asked with a smile:
"How does your nose grow, kaleb?"
"Vaksi steadily."
From this I saw that the grabbing up of the foot and the vake were not expressions of pain but some new nonsense.
Lest they should take me for a bivak I started from my seat, and placing my finger on my nose said to the newcomer:
"Pricc-prucc."
By way of reply I got a deep, resentful look.
My acquaintance dug me in the ribs with frightened perplexity, at which I, still more confused, scratched the posterior of the copper-cubed arrival.
At this the copper-cubed one contemptuously looked me up and down and wanted to move on but my acquaintance leapt before him and placing his right hand on his head explained entreatingly:
"Elak betik!
Oh, kvari for this bivak!
The worthless creature has only just arrived and does not know what the ketni is."
Copper-cubes was considerably appeased; with a cordial smile he twitched the nose of my acquaintance and then mine.
"That's a different matter," he said graciously.
"How does your nose grow, kaleb?"
I gazed like an idiot and was about to say that it did not brow at all, but my acquaintance poked me again in the ribs, so I thought I had better keep silent.
The newcomer continued on his way and my acquaintance, again snatching his right foot into his hand, wailed and bellowed vake- vake, so that I already wanted to go to his help but he pushed me away.
I stood there agape with my feet rooted to the ground.
When Copper-cubes was already far away, my acquaintance turned and fell on me angrily.
"How could you say pricc-prucc to a betik, you bivak?!"
"Well, was it not you who told me?" I stammered.
"But to a betik!
Didn't you see the bilevs on his feet?"
"The copper cubes?"
"They are not copper-cubes, they are bilevs!"
"Are they not made of copper?"
"Well..." he said filled with anguish, "perhaps, if we look at it like that, that's what they are made of, but you must not say so."
"And why not if that's what they are made of?" I snorted.
"For you must understand they are not made of it!" he cried.
"It is not material, it is an a n e b a!
You must not say about it that it is material, because it is the material-like manifestation of the bikru's existence, and it is not permitted even to think about whether it is material or not."
I had no idea what the aneba and the bikru were but the cube was material for certain.
But what sort of stupidity is required for denying what everyone can see with his own eyes?!
I state at the outset that nobody ever called the bilevs material.
Once I saw a locksmith who was just burnishing a pair of bilevs, and he, too, was convinced that actually there was nothing in his hands, or properly speaking there was the material-like manifestation of the bikru's being, which could be neither seen nor touched, though it was in his hands and he was, manifestly, continuously touching it.
At these words I was attacked anew by fear.
In a seemingly calm way I enquired:
"Then what is the b i l e v?"
"It indicates that one is a betik."
"What does betik mean?
What does a betik do?"
"Nothing!
He is a betik!
And a betik is elak!
Do you understand?
And when an elak is concerned the belki is not pricc-prucc but, as I did, you must snatch your foot in your hand and wail: 'Vake!
Vake!'
As an indication that your foot aches because you cannot wear bilevs on it."
"It aches because I don't wear them?"
I was now utterly confused.
"It would ache if I did!"
"Hush!" he said, looking round in a frightened manner.
"You must not say so!"
"Come now!" I snorted.
"You surely don't want to make me believe that my feet ache because I don't wear bilevs to hit them?
Even the simplest common sense protests against such nonsense!"
"I recommend you in your own interest," he said severely, "not to speak in this manner.
There are certain things which cannot be disputed, and must be accepted without reference to common sense as they are aneba things, and it is well known that all of us would be only too pleased to tie on the bilevs, because a betik is elak."
"Let me rather not be a betik and elak," I said with deep conviction at which he gave a loud laugh.
"Oh, what a bivak you are still!
You poor ignoramus!
I recommend you not to say such things for the others will laugh their heads off.
On the other hand, if you keep on asserting your nonsense, they may grow angry and somebody will call you lamik, and if you suffer that, you must immediately stab a knife into him."
"Because he has said that I am lamik?"
"Of course!"
"Who would compel me to stab a knife into him for that?"
He looked at me compassionately.
"Would you swallow somebody calling you lamik?"
"And why shouldn't he say it if it pleases him?"
"Because the word is borema!" he said with infinite solemnity.
At this I burst into laughter.
"Well, let them have some consideration when they say it. If it doesn't hurt me, I will not stab, and if I don't stab, it will be of even less harm to me."
He looked me up and down completely amazed.
"You... do you believe that it would be of no harm to, you?"
The laughter froze on my lips.
By now I myself began to get scared.
"Why?" I asked.
"What kind of danger could be entailed by my failure to stab someone?"
"What kind of danger?
Oh, you poor newcomer!
So you are not yet aware of the consequences?"
"No!
Of course not!
Tell me!" I urged him excitedly.
"Well, look here.
If you don't take up the knife, the Behins will meet, draw up minutes of the meeting and declare you unqualified to fight with a knife."
"And what does that mean for me?"
"And this means," now he stepped back and poked his forefinger against my chest, "that later you will not be stabbed by others either!"
He placed his hands on his hips and waited for the effect, which did not fail to follow.
That is, I stood for a minute gaping, then laughter burst forth from me anew with overwhelming force.
As I saw it, here everybody continuously harped on words assembled in an idiotic way; to this they pay homage, to that they feel repugnance, but the main characteristic of each word was that it had nothing to do with reality.
My acquaintance gave an angry wave of the hand.
"You have no faculty for the ketni.
Take care, because if I don't teach you, you will be exposed to the greatest enoa."
That much I had already guessed - enoa meant anger, contempt, or some such thing, to which the knife also belonged, so I thought it better to stifle the protest from my common sense and reverted to the main subject.
"Tell me, why was the betik interested in the growth of our noses?"
"Not the betik but the elak betik."
"But you said betik!"
"Yes, I did say that.
But if you refer to him, you must call him an elak betik.
I was sitting here on this bench earlier."
I was perplexed but again curbed my outraged common sense.
"All right, all right!
So why was he interested in the growth of our noses?"
"First of all, he was not interested, as a betik is not interested in things, he only enquires.
Next, if he were interested, he would not be interested in the growth of my nose, it's only a custom to enquire.
But mind! You must not ask about the nose of a betik, only he about yours.
This is the ketni."
I was fed up with the ketni.
I should have liked to speak about more sober things.
"Tell me about eating here.
Where do we get the food from and where do we eat it?"
He started in fear.
He pressed his hand on his mouth and looked round in alarm.
"Hush!
Don't say such a bivak thing!
Say: when and from where do we get spirituality."
"Spirituality?
Do people not eat here?"
"Hush!
Hush!
At least speak more softly!"
He drew nearer and explained in a whisper.
"Spirituality is what you have mentioned, but it must not be said in that way, because it is kave."
"You mean that eating must not be called eating, because you have invented the word kave.
A senselessly coined word you replace by another senseless one, and manufacture such concepts out of thin air, by the ton.
Tell me: can a reasonable man not be found among you who would relentlessly say that we don't live for words themselves but that words are to be used in life?"
He now looked at me compassionately.
"I only wanted to help you," he said.
"As for me, I kvari your words, because I am a tolerant and enlightened man, who has always professed that a wrong action does not necessarily result from bad intentions, but may also originate in ignorance.
But you attack all the anebas so strongly that for this everybody would enoate and call you a lamik - you might even be heavily punished, too."
"Punished?" I cried, taken aback.
"Whom did I want to harm?
Did I not want to make life easier for you?
I want to liberate you from the shackles of the nonsense which meaninglessly render your life more difficult, and you have the nerve to enoate because of me?!"
"Don't say any more of that nonsense!" he cried with flashing eyes.
I was startled.
Instead of saying thank you for the help, they were still persecuting one whose clear-sightedness wanted to improve their life.
Such a thing could indeed only be done by lunatics.
It was a general custom with them that they did not expect kindness and morality of each other but certain compulsory lies.
It was a more important requirement with them that the material nature of the copper cube should be denied so that nobody should beat his neighbour to death.
It is for this reason that I strongly suggest to anyone who may find himself among such lunatics not to try to be good and helpful, as it is their most characteristic attribute that they fly at the throat of the sound-minded.
So I preferred to let him have his way and he continued.
"You had better thank your good luck for having led you to me.
Anyone else would have long ago taken you to the betik.
But I don't want to suppose you have any ill will in you, and in spite of your strong attacks, I am still willing to believe that by learning the ketni you will mend your ways, for now you are still not aware of the monstrosity of your words.
Well, pricc-prucc."
"Pricc-prucc," I said placing my finger on my nose by which he was visibly pleased, we scratched each other's posterior and I hurried on.
The Reader may have perceived that the speech of my acquaintance also included words which did not figure in the Hin language, such as good and ill will, punishment, laughing, pleasure, and so on.
Although they were also for me completely new, I could gather their meaning from his speech, and now render them in English translation.
I give in the original only those words which do not convey something which actually exists, so that in a language created by reason there cannot be any counterpart for them.
As I wanted to have a good look round at my new country, I set off in the yard.
After the long L-shaped building I saw some barn-like ones. I had, as yet, no idea as to their function, but I did see that they were in a very neglected state.
I thought the Behins could not build it.
So I was all the more surprised to catch sight of a bricklayer's scaffold behind them that covered quite a tolerable building.
But the real surprise came only later.
Part of the house was in fact already complete, above the scaffold, and a team of workers was engaged in demolishing it with pickaxes.
I did not understand the connection and pulling myself together I asked one of the workers what purpose the building was to serve.
He said that it would be flats for the Behins.
"Then why are you pulling down the other half of it?" I inquired.
"So that we should not remain homeless."
I thought I had not properly posed the question and asked again and again, but he repeatedly replied that the house which had been built had to be pulled down, because if it were to remain, people would remain homeless.
"Well, I don't understand that," I declared.
"I wonder why," he replied, distrustfully scrutinizing my face.
"Why, it is obvious, even to the ultimate box-shaker."
"Box-shaker?
What is a box-shaker?"
At this the mason put down his pickaxe and stepped towards me.
"Don't you understand that either?" he asked and a queer light flashed in his eyes.
My whole being became covered with goose-flesh.
"But yes... of course..." I stammered backing away. Then turning round suddenly, I shot off at a wild gallop.
Fortunately the man did not follow me.
Now I hurried into my room without the least delay but I did not feel safe even there as it had no lock.
I also decided to leave the door open.
At least I should see if anyone were to pass by.
I was afraid of everything that might follow, but on the other hand I wanted to see everything, so that, from a safe distance, I should learn, without any scandals, as much as was necessary for me to avoid being beaten.
As I crouched in my room, a little table appeared from the wall by itself and through a flap-door behind it a dish of food was pushed onto it, and then the door closed again.
So the food problem had solved itself, thanks to the Hins thinking of everything. As for me, I fell upon it, and started to eat voraciously.
Here I might have asked questions to no avail, everyone would have turned away shocked if asked about "spirituality", and I might have died of starvation because of the ketni.
A few minutes later a woman passed along the corridor.
She stopped before the open door and glanced at me.
She kept a handkerchief in front of her mouth (at that time I believed she had toothache) but even so I noticed she was smiling.
All this, however, lasted only a second because no sooner had her glance fallen on the food than she cried out and collapsed.
I darted up immediately to help her but already others had gathered. Excitedly they were questioning each other and when one of them caught sight of the food on my table and the spoon in my hand, he shouted at me, beside himself with rage:
"When you perform spirituality, shut the door, you bivak!"
"The lungs should be torn out of such a person!" bellowed another.
From somewhere a low grumbling could be heard:
"Lamik..."
My blood froze in my veins.
This was the word for which I had to stab, only I did not know why.
I fingered the knife in bewilderment.
Outside a clamour of consternation could be heard.
They looked for the grumbler and looked at me to see what I would do.
"But still it cannot be uttered," said another one breaking the silence.
"He has the right to say what he wants to," said a third.
"He hasn't!"
"But he has!"
"Who said lamik?"
"It's none of your business!" then he turned to me.
"To which beha do you belong, kona or kemon?"
I did not even know whether I was a boy or a girl, only that I had to answer to escape.
"Kona," I said daringly.
The word worked a miracle and brought about a turn of events for which I was not at all prepared.
The crowd, which up to then had unanimously raged against me, broke into two groups.
One half immediately wanted to jump upon me, the others, led by the former inquirer, stood in front of my door and wanted to push them back.
Wild shouting broke out, and within a short space of time everybody was fighting.
I thought of the woman lying in a faint who had been completely forgotten.
I cried out that they should not trample her to death, but it seemed she was less than oblivious because no sooner did she get the first kick than her faint disappeared and with a further scream she ran away.
And in the corridor more and more people intervened in the fight.
One of my defenders was thrown against the door so that it was torn off its hinges, with a crack, the panes of glass fell out clattering, and I was jammed in and could not even cry for help, lest I might infringe an aneba or the like.
To tell the truth I would have been pleasantly gratified if both parties had exterminated each other to the last man, but at least those who had wanted to rush at me should perish.
This latter desire fortunately materialized, as after a five-minute bloody struggle my enemies, still wildly shouting, were routed.
My defender came in to me gasping, but at the sight of the food he turned red and spun round.
"Kvari, kvari" he stammered and tried to close the door while going out, at which it finally collapsed.
With a sudden inspiration I took the bed-cover and laid it over the food, which indeed solved the problem at once.
My visitor came back in smiling, and placing his finger on his nose he panted out a warm pricc-prucc.
After mutual scratching of posteriors a very friendly atmosphere evolved between us.
I had definitely the same feeling as during conjuring when the juggler says "Hey presto!" and a pigeon flies out of a top hat; what one does not understand is purely the connection between the "Hey presto" and the pigeon.
Although the situation was extremely confused I tried to conduct myself as befits a gentleman.
I briefly begged his indulgence for my not being able to convey the gratitude I felt towards him, but frankly speaking I was a foreigner and in the Hin language there was no suitable expression for this.
I realized only afterwards what dangers might stem from my rash sincerity, because in this way I also disclosed that I had no idea of the nature of the kona as I had so bravely declared myself a short while ago.
But the Behin settlement is the land of surprises.
For my visitor, instead of rebuking me, with a broad smile expressed his great pleasure that even though I had not known what it was I had confessed myself kona, which proved I had immediately felt the boeto given by the kona.
I must say straight away that I never came to know anything about the nature of the boeto. Nor did they themselves.
Nobody knew what it was. They merely continued to debate whether the kona or the kemon gave the true boeto.
It was about this that the two perpetually quarrelling parties, or whatever they were, had been founded.
After this event my new acquaintance began to teach me with all willingness.
He explained what the fooling was called if our enemy was lying on the ground; if someone stronger hit us unjustly; what we felt towards those who fought with or against us; what kind of feeling was caused by the sight of spirituality, or what one felt towards a betik or a bivak.
This way I learned many things, such as joy, grief, gratitude, triumph, defeat, indignation, respect, and other words.
I also understood that kvari was meant for something like an apology, ketni some rule of life, kave for shame, and yet these did not correspond precisely to their translation and the others had no equivalent at all in the English language.
As to what the words aneba, betik, vake, elak, lamik, borema, boeti, bivak meant, I did not learn - neither then nor to this very day. My questions were in vain.
They themselves simply did not know; they only explained that the aneba, for instance, must not be deprecated, that one had to behave towards a betik in a humble manner, but of the essence nobody knew a thing, and it was not even proper to ask about such matters.
One characteristic of their words was precisely this: it was forbidden not only to doubt their truth, but also to think about them.
One simply had to believe, but they often did not even say in what-simply to believe.
The situation reminded me very much of our mental hospitals, where, similarly, people feel pleasure, gratitude, love and hatred, but while one is happy painting his nose blue, another worships a duck's feather, a third hurls himself on the fourth with indignation if the latter is not willing to bow before a watertap and say "abracadabra"; while, if he does utter the word "abracadabra", he has his hand kissed.
And here there were a vast number of such abracadabras, for instance the word kona itself.
My protector, who, by the way, was called Zemoeki, reassured me that I should not be afraid, and wherever I became exposed to an attack, I had only to cry out "vake kona!" at which a lot of people who belonged to the kona would come to my help, all brave and valiant Behins, whereas those belonging to the kemon were all base and hated the konas. He could not give me any reason, except that the kemon believed it gave the true boeto, although it was widely known that outside the kona the true boeto was completely impossible.
Anyone who did not admit it was heading in the wrong direction and it was for this reason that I had to hate the kemons.
Then I was suddenly given the instruction that were I to see a circle' drawn anywhere I should erase it and try to draw a square. If however, anyone drawing a square on the walls were to be attacked by the kemons, I should not hesitate to fly to his assistance, because we had to keep together in defence of the square, and even sacrifice our life for the anebas.
Then my new friend left with a warm pricc-prucc and I tried to get some fresh air.
I opened my window, then tried to warm my food which had grown cold, but this was a problem since the rickety electric hot-plate I mentioned earlier had no desire to function any more.
Using my pocket knife I managed to tinker with its broken switch so that finally it was willing to heat, but then its broken legs gave up the ghost.
In the end I somehow managed to support it, warmed my lunch, and, considering the circumstances, ate it with a good appetite.
During my belated lunch, I endeavoured to sum up the experiences of the first day.
The Behins were definitely not hapless normal people expelled by the Hins' lack of understanding but were indeed insane: that much was already beyond doubt.
Their disease far exceeded the mental disorders known to us.
Even in our lunatic asylums it may occur, for instance, that someone eats his handkerchief, imagines himself to be noodles sprinkled with ground poppy-seeds and sugar, or falls out with someone else because he is not willing to see the sweeping-brush as a sceptre; but that they should create meaningless words at the cost of hard mental work for things which do not exist, and that the whole bedlam should subject itself to them, and that on account of stupid geometrical figures the whole society should pummel each other-such things cannot be imagined in our lunatic asylums.
So the Reader may be justified in thinking that for the sake of effect I perhaps colour the account of my travels with things as do not perfectly conform to reality, in the manner of travellers who, to show off their having seen a great deal of the world and relying on the fact that their data can hardly be checked, abuse the credulity of the public.
I am afraid that during the chapters to follow the Reader's doubts will be still further increased, so I must assure him in advance that I have checked my travel notes several times, and preferred to include less in my book rather than exaggerate even once.
One thing is certain: at the sunset of the first day I remembered with a sigh the "horrors" of the "eventless" life among the Hins.
I had thirsted for events.
Well, my wish had definitely been granted; if only my nerves would be able to stand it!
CHAPTER TEN
Author accepted in the kona whose significance is not yet clear to him - His spirituality taken away by force - He is given a peculiar post - The Behins' theory of the nourishing quality of the pebble - We learn what the word lamik means - The Behins' extraordinary economic views - Boetology
A few days later Zemoeki entered my room, his face radiant with joy, and, scratching my posterior, he let me know extremely cordially that great happiness was in store for me.
In reply to my excited and joyful questions I was told that I had been accepted into the kona.
The answer somewhat cooled me down and, having hesitatingly inquired as to its practical value, I was again told only that it meant great joy to be a kona for this was what gave the true boeto.
When I asked what the boeto was, he replied that to win the boeto was joy and happiness.
So this way I did not become much wiser and, instead of joy I felt a certain amount of embarrassment, which, however, I did not dare to voice.
Later I realized that boeto was the very same kind of empty word as ketni; an action was ketni, because it had to be done in a certain way - and conversely, it had to be done in a certain way because it was ketni.
It was this vicious circle that constituted the main feature of their confused twaddling, this arguing with no point of reference to connect their world with the co-ordinates of the outside world.
Being exposed to their whims, however, I did not venture to argue but, pretending even to be pleased, I cautiously asked what kind of conduct was necessary to receive the grace of the boeto.
Zemoeki reassured me that he would arrange everything and left.
Before long he returned with a companion who, as I came to know later, was called Zeremble.
Zemoeki and Zeremble then called me away to arrange and carry out my initiation.
We crossed the vast yard and entered a distant building.
The upper part of the door was boarded up so that we had to bend down.
I had not the slightest idea why they had made it like this.
Now we stepped into a very strange room, where none of the furniture was in its proper place or position.
I saw a table which had only a frame with no top, but which was nevertheless fitted out with a back like that of a chair.
From the bare frame, there hung on strings yellow pebbles on the backs of which the stains of different paints could be seen trickling down.
Another table stood with its legs upwards covered with some strange sheet, which, however, could not be used for either a bed-sheet or a tablecloth as it had holes punched all over and thick bass ropes intertwined over and over through the holes with yellow pebbles on the ends.
Behind the table there was a chair.
This had a serrated seat so that the thighs of anyone sitting on it would have been in the greatest danger; its back was three times larger than necessary with irregular carving all the way up. Thorns were driven through its seat, making it impossible to sit on.
In general the whole room gave the impression that vandals had spoiled everything to make it unusable, or that I had entered the den of destructive spirits.
Fear and horror gripped my heart; I had strange forebodings.
I cautiously asked Zemoeki:
"What has happened here?"
Zemoeki opened his eyes wide. At first he did not understand why I asked and it was only with considerable incredulity that I came to know that the devastation had not been perpetrated by an enemy army but by the owners themselves.
When I asked why, he replied:
"Because it is so kipu."
Another new word they had concocted in order to justify another piece of nonsense.
Of course, instead of quieting me, the fact that the destruction had been done by themselves gave rise to even more terrible forebodings concerning my future.
A few minutes later a door opened in the background and an odd-looking man entered.
From his knees the copper cubes, already mentioned, hung down. So he, too, was a betik.
Over his shoulders he wore a large piece of glaring cloth which, with a little benevolent imagination, could have been taken for a raincoat by those with some common sense and it would seem that they had pierced and torn it everywhere and hung scraps of glass from it so that it could not be used for such a purpose.
Now the betik tied two huge baking sheets underneath his soles, came up to me and murmuring unintelligible words, hit me on the head with a hollow tin ball.
Laughter bubbled up inside me at these stupidities but seeing that the others did not laugh at all but were touched and solemn when Baking-sheet-soles made his appearance, I stifled my own laughter, too, and, although it was difficult, contrived to adopt a solemn countenance.
When the ceremony was finished everybody gathered around me. They scratched my posterior and were very delighted at my becoming a kona which, as they had said, meant great joy, for I had thus won the true boeto.
The pleasure slowly spread into me as well, as I really felt relief at having managed to accomplish the boeto so smoothly.
After what had happened previously, I had been prepared for much worse.
Unfortunately my pleasure was somewhat premature, as the Reader will see.
But I must not anticipate.
Having left the betik I could not suppress a smile.
I recalled my little son who was happy and clapped his hands when he was given a piece of cake and I imagined the puzzled little face he would have made at such words as: "Be glad, my son, because you have become a kona and won the boeto."
He would obviously have drawn some conclusions as to the mental condition of his father.
How deep is the darkness in which, compared even to the children of the glorious British monarchy, these miserable adults live!
On the way home I seriously asked Zemoeki what I profited from becoming a kona, but I insisted that he say something factual and not merely to keep mentioning the boeto.
Their demented brains are so deeply involved in their fantasies that at first he did not even understand my question.
He kept on asserting that all the anebas to which the kona, boeto, ketni, kipu and other fantasticalities belonged constituted full reality, for it was these which sustained mankind; without these we could not even live, and anyone who did not feel the anebas was a bivak to whom it would be in vain to explain all these.
And a bivak was a lost man, devoid of all content.
After a long struggle I succeeded in more or less bringing him round to the dull but solid ground of the natural world, so that at last he groaned out the first fact.
"From now on, you, too, have the right to participate in the buku."
"What does that mean?"
"You have the right to beat the kemons if they draw their hideous circles on the wall or outrage the square."
"How is it possible to outrage a geometric figure?"
"They break the corners off, or draw diagonals into it."
I was somewhat embarrassed.
"Well, and what else?" I asked after a short interval.
"What do you mean by 'and what else'?
Would you be able to tolerate the fact that they draw diagonals into the square?"
To tell the truth I would have, but the intonation made me surmise that it was advisable to say no.
I did my best to protest against this insinuation, declaring that I would immediately tear the intestines out of anyone who drew diagonals into the square.
This resolute attitude visibly restored my shaky reputation.
Zemoeki regained his composure and stated that I was a brave man, although I did not have the slightest idea why.
I also learned that I was worthy of being taken by the nose by the betik, which according to them was a very good thing, as it happened only to exceedingly brave konas.
I was, however, much more interested in fighting as a new danger, but when I inquired about it he said:
"It is not fighting. It is buku."
"But you have just said that we have to beat the kemons.
Why is it not a fighting if we are to beat each other?"
"Not each other. The kemons."
"And the kemons the konas..."
"That's it."
"Well, then why not each other?"
"Because we do not beat each other, only the kemons, and that is quite another matter.
This is buku, which is pervaded by the boeto.
Fighting is a nasty thing which a ketni man will not commit; the buku is, however, to make one better and nobler, as well as to develop solidarity and respect for each other."
I inquired twice but it became clear that I had not misunderstood him.
It is their faith that they respect each other and keep together if they thrash each other!
It took me some minutes to collect my thoughts.
It was not as if I had any doubt as to the value of my "privileges", but because the greatest problem of the sane mind among the crazy is how to manifest itself so that it should not be struck dead and yet speak reasonably.
I got into trouble several more times on account of the attribute of common sense whereby it can walk straight with ease, but when it tries to limp it falls.
The Behins sometimes seemed to me quite talented in the way they limped.
The gentle Reader should not be surprised.
Once I had a case - I was called to a patient who showed insanity symptoms.
He replied to questions with a completely confused mixture of sounds.
When, for instance, I asked how he was, he said in answer something like, "Balevi abargetine trendad homagrido."
Of course, I reported in my institute that the patient talked disconnectedly.
They asked what I meant by disconnected talk.
I tried to demonstrate but was forced to realize that I was not able to improvise meaningless heaps of letters and sounds.
(By the way, while devising the above example, my mind doggedly sought words that made sense. The patient, however, had gabbled it all out without thinking.)
So I said in reply to Zemoeki that from the point of view of the kona the most expedient way of taking revenge on the villainous kemons would be simply not to care for the square.
Let them mutilate it and draw diagonals into it as they please.
If we did not react, they would eventually become enraged.
Zemoeki and Zeremble looked at each other in consternation and stated that my only excuse could be my being a novice, for to speak of the anebas with such cynicism was a great sin, and by my words I exposed myself to the suspicion of aligning myself with the kemons.
The fruitless struggle truly wore out my brain.
I curbed my rebellious common sense attitude with difficulty and promised that I should try to acquire some feeling for the anebas.
My greatest anxiety, however, was to avoid the danger of fighting, so I asked:
"How does the buku usually commence?"
"The villainous kemons," answered Zemoeki, "burst into our rooms and break up the electric cookers, at which every decent kona, too, makes his way into the rooms of the kemons and breaks their cookers up.
But it may also happen that the provocative behaviour of the kemons gives rise to our righteous indignation they force us into the buku and then we break up their cookers first and they in turn ours."
Suddenly I realized with dismay why my cooker was in such a state of disrepair.
I only asked why this mutual terrible destruction had to take place.
"Well, we must certainly defend the hearth, mustn't we?" he answered in the most natural tone in the world.
With this we parted and with a heavy heart I retired to rest.
Finally I resolved that in the future I simply would not mix with them so that by making myself independent I should bear it until I got free of them one way or another without trouble.
Fortunately there were the wise Hins who handed in my meal every day, and for my own part, I would lock myself up in my room and not spend more time in the open than was strictly necessary, and even then I would not communicate with them.
Oh, if I had had the slightest idea of what might follow, the soothing sleep that soon overcame me would by no means have come to my eyes.
For the insanity of the Behins is the most terrible of all the dangerous epidemics.
While with us only accidental infection is known, here I had to become familiar with the idea of infection by force.
One cannot isolate oneself!
They follow and compel one to rave with them.
It is in vain for the sane mind to try diverting itself; it promises in vain to be silent and against its better judgement it will watch their suicidal dance without a helping word.
Madness is a generally binding rule here.
For if it were only belief in the anebas and other freaks that was at issue, one could carry it off by approving everything.
But no!
Their madness imposes actual physical suffering on everyone, from which there is no escape.
This I myself was obliged to experience sadly the next day.
The very next day, when I got my dinner through the wall. No sooner had I sat down to it, than Zemoeki entered with a radiant face together with his two companions, and let me know that I was once more to be the recipient of great pleasure.
At this my teeth were set on edge and I broke into a sweat. Not without reason.
Zemoeki announced that the Council of Betiks had permitted me to partake of the boeto and deliver up my spirituality.
With this he blindfolded his two companions; they felt their way to my food, covered it with another handkerchief and simply took it away.
I looked after them dumbfounded. I wanted to say I could not starve, but as any word about eating would have been kave and would only have shocked him, I explained to Zemoeki stammering and in a devious way that without spirituality I felt I would die.
Zemoeki replied benevolently that spirituality was acknowledged to be no more than the burden of life while to every decent and honest kona the boeto was not a blow; why this was how spirituality got to the betik, by which it purified the contaminations and became the bikru's material manifestation. Thus I served the kona, kipu and ketni as well, so it meant pleasure and honour to my own self if I partook of the graces of the boeto.
I could not help it - this delight did not satisfy me. Why, my life was at stake!
I did not let Zemoeki go, but made him sit down, and asked him to find some way for me to partake of spirituality, as after all it could not be denied that everybody retained some relationship with it.
The intimate conversation also untied Zemoeki's tongue, and he confessed to me in a whisper that he, too, partook of it daily and promised to be of help if I would only treat what he told me as confidential.
Having assured him of my discretion, we talked the matter over thoroughly and he suggested that if I wished to partake of spirituality, I should perform some useful work as I could not expect the betiks to feed me gratis.
This surprised me immensely as it was known to all that the food was handed in by the Hins, so that practically everybody was a parasite; if, however, we still had wanted to distinguish between Behin and Behin then it was only the betiks who could have been called parasites, who simply took away my spirituality.
When I broached the matter, however, I got a resentful answer as if I had taken their spirituality away and he stated that, on the contrary, as the bee got the honey from the bee-keeper, so we, too, got our spirituality from the betik.
I could not believe my ears; I thought he confused the words by accident, but as it turned out, they actually professed that the bee-keeper gave the honey to the bees, and in a similar way everyone owed a debt of gratitude to his spirituality-giving betik, and I should just contemplate where it would lead if the betiks were to cease functioning one day and everyone would die of hunger.
To this I answered that the Hins provided the spirituality, against which he strongly protested.
And when I asserted that I had seen it being handed in with my own eyes, he replied that it would be good for me to dispense with referring to my eyes.
A true kona could not say such a kave thing, we had to believe that it was the betik who gave it, besides man had not only eyes but also bruhu and this was more important.
The bruhu, too, signifies something non-existent.
With words, of course, only existing things can be described, so I cannot relate anything on its own merit, only as to when they use it.
Well, the bruhu was the final cause of the whole of this unnatural way of life and conception.
The damaged chair is needed because it is kipu, you must wail vake because it is ketni, the square must not be violated, as it is aneba.
And if sane minds question why the ketni, kipu and aneba are necessary at all, they will reply, "Because man has bruhu".
This bruhu needs only things which for man himself are unnecessary.
According to this, the supposition that the bruhu as ultimate cause should be translated as paranoia would seem obvious; the illness of the Behins, however, went beyond the symptoms of paranoia, to say nothing of the fact that they kept mentioning the bruhu not as a state but as something self-existent, even as something which existed and at the same time did not exist.
For when I asked what the bruhu was like, they looked at me shocked and called me bivak, but could not describe its form.
Zemoeki offered benevolently to be of help to me in securing a useful occupation, and until then would let me have some of his own spirituality.
Indeed, a few days later he took me to a betik.
On Zemoeki's advice, with my left hand on my head, I held one of my feet with my right hand, and surpassing even his yell, wailed vake- vake, at which the betik, with regard to Zemoeki's person, received me very cordially, and, calling me kaleb, inquired after the growth of my nose and was pleased to state that he was willing to employ me as beratnu, although many outstanding konas had competed for this position, including some who had already given evidence of their feeling for the anebas by tearing out the guts of several kemons.
So with this I took up my post.
For what I had to do from then on, I blush with shame as I write.
I accept that my Readers will despise me, a British subject, for sinking so low, and I cannot be silent about it as it is my firm resolution to speak out plainly and sincerely about everything in accordance with the true facts as is worthy of an English gentleman, even though the truth may be disadvantageous to me.
By way of excuse I have only to mention that I had to keep my post as otherwise I would have exposed myself to starvation.
To reassure my fellow-countrymen, I further declare that I did not forget my duty to my country among the Behins either, and in my humiliating situation I never disclosed my background - whenever I was asked about it I always declared myself American.
Hoping by my correct conduct I have succeeded a little in conciliating my beloved compatriots, I will try to describe my work.
This entailed two tasks.
The first was that every third day the Behins slung a queer piece of cloth - punched to rags - over my shoulders and I had to carry a shining square over the yard while a baking-sheet-soled betik walked before me with a tin-box in his hands. A strange melody was played around me on musical instruments, some device generated putrid gas and finally I had to set on fire a suit of very good clothes.
My other task was the distribution of the yellow pebbles.
This meant that I had to collect yellow pebbles which on certain days I carried in the tin box already mentioned in front of the betik. They rattled noisily.
The betik stepped beside me and hitting the side of the box with a pebble twice motioned to me to distribute the pebbles.
And I opened the lid and gave one to everybody.
At this in an ecstasy of joy people grabbed their right foot up intone hand, cried vake- vake and squeezing the pebbles under their arms, dispersed.
Although this mummery in itself was exceedingly farcical and outdid the most bizarre carnival, the most ludicrous thing was the explanation-these unfortunates believed that the pebble they squeezed under their arm was nourishing; they were even convinced that it was this which maintained life, the human body, and they praised the betik for it.
The meal, as we already know, was despised by public opinion, although everyone ate it.
(The word "spirituality" was only to sooth their consciences.)
But with this we have not yet reached the limit of their absurd behaviour.
With this went also the belief that only those pebbles were nourishing whose box the betik had touched.
When I gathered them from the ground they were not yet nourishing, and they became nourishing only when placed under the arm.
They would not swallow them, however, and even touching them to the mouth was forbidden as it would have amounted to an outrage of the pebble.
So far as they were concerned it was possible to "outrage" a pebble for, as we know, eating and the mouth were shameful things.
I myself saw a lawsuit against a Behin who was accused of eating bread and butter with the pebble under his arm.
And with the most serious expressions they heard a crowd of witnesses who refuted that it could have occurred this way.
The Behin, however, was still convicted as it had been proved that, with the pebble under his arm, he mentioned "bread and butter", by which therefore the pebble had already suffered wrong.
Even this was proscribed as, on such occasions, even to think of spirituality was not permitted.
This madness of squeezing a pebble worked on my mind and once I ventured to state in front of Zemoeki that perhaps it was not nourishing after all.
In evidence I referred to the fact that no living organism in the world took nourishment this way.
Zemoeki in return explained to me that the pebble theory was verified by precisely this fact. As man had bruhu, he did not belong to the common living organisms of the world, so it was self-evident that he had different needs.
I answered that as I had become acquainted with human anatomy at Oxford University, from his stomach to every single hair, each of man's organs needed food and not pebbles.
Zemoeki, however, warned me that I again referred to my eyes and experience, which was not good, and warmly recommended that I should beware of casting doubt upon pebble-nourishment as that, too, was an aneba, and the Behins were very particular about their bruhu, and they had taken bloody revenge for such blasphemy on more than one lamik.
So again I heard the baleful word lamik at the mention of which I was to draw my knife, and of whose meaning I still had no idea.
At this moment Zemoeki painfully yelled vake- vake and as I looked up I saw my own Baking-sheet-soled approaching, before whom a Behin walked and watered the grass.
Of course, I myself also snatched my foot up, and we attempted to outvie each other in wailing until the creature passed out of sight.
Then I asked why the grass had been watered before him but Zemoeki could only answer that he was a betik.
In reply to my question as to why the betik needed wet grass, he answered again, "Because he is a betik."
I gazed at him with a puzzled expression and he explained that there were even more betik betiks, too, in front of wham two or three Behins watered because they were still more betik.
After all this I dared to venture only quite softly and timidly that watering was perhaps not the most useful occupation.
"I would have you know," he said, "you are not in a position to assert any such thing."
"Why?"
"Because you are a beratnu and a beratnu must not say things like that."
Thus it was not because the assertion was not true, but because I was a beratnu.
So I thought it better to keep silent and continued distributing the yellow pebbles.
Later I had the opportunity to see the most fantastic offices that can be imagined.
From among them the Rust Measuring and Record Office bear special mention though in a later chapter.
From among the posts, I feel that I must mention that of the figure-guards.
One of the trees in the yard had a shining tin square wired to the top.
Under this tree two Behins permanently idled their time away in shifts. They kept guard lest any of the depraved kemons should throw stones at or use insulting language to the tin.
The common-sense reaction would have been to throw the whole rubbish into the dustbin so that there should be nothing to be pelted and guarded, but such a straight and reasonable opinion I naturally no longer dared to put forward.
Instead I merely asked Zemoeki whether it would not have been better if these guards did some work, which might be of more service to the welfare of the kona.
Zemoeki resentfully put me wise to the fact that it was they who did the most honest and useful work possible for the benefit of the kona.
I fell silent and, wishing to emphasize my appreciation of his remarks, said that it was gratifying that the workers met with such a recognition.
But in vain. Among the Behins you cannot say anything which does not offend some monomania. Now I was scolded for having called the elak figure-guards workers.
By the way, for my own work I received money, the existence of which I had totally forgotten since being among the Hins.
With the money I was to go to the Nourishing and Life-Giving Office, where I could buy spirituality, but considerably less than I had got from the Hins, as the bulk of the food was eaten up by the betiks.
Here in the place of confiscation and distribution I saw in the end the most real occupation.
They at least concerned themselves with existing materials, even though they did- so in a wretched and wicked manner.
I became much less well nourished, and so I met once more the other concept which I had forgotten whilst among the Hins - as if it had not existed: the idea of financial difficulties.
I began to see things from the materialistic point of view again only with the revival of this. Because I admit that until my food was taken away I had not given a thought as to how the others were fed.
Now I came to know that there were many hungry people among them, from whom even the clothes due to them had been taken away - they were even driven out of their room, so that many of them dwelt in the open air.
I repeat, there is no escape from the insanity of the Behins.
One cannot remain aloof: they follow one.
They take one's food and clothes away, and it would be in vain to nod assent and let them do so, so that they should just permit one to retire into a part of the yard like a hermit to grow potato and fruit.
That is not permitted either.
The only mode of life is to join them and actively take part in their suicidal dance of death.
The freedom of private life cannot even be mentioned.
They take one along with them. They rob, torture and compel one to betray one's sobriety daily; and one cannot have a minute's rest as the bedlam is ceaselessly seething in the background and swishing its whip chases after one to cause suffering.
As I have already mentioned, the new clothes were confiscated, too.
Some of them were worn out by the betiks while the others they tore and punched to rags as they could "use" them only in that condition.
Apart from this and with my heart aching, I had to set a suit of clothes on fire every third day while holding the square of shining tin on high.
And the Behins got only cast-off clothes and even these they had to wear for years whilst before their very eyes brand-new fine suits were burnt and torn, to which they vaked as they believed that without this destruction they would have gone naked.
I should have liked once to tell Zemoeki my opinion but having already had the bitter experience that they regarded anyone who tried to improve their life as their enemy, I inquired only as to why the burning of the clothes under the square was necessary.
"The boeto," was the answer.
"By this we win the telerays of the bikru for the buku against the kemons and the circle."
I could not prevent myself from remarking that in that case I still did not hold the buku an expedient affair; but lest he should accuse me of aligning myself with the kemons, I hurriedly added that I wanted to take sides neither with the konas nor with the kemons but was of the opinion that it would be best if there were neither square nor circle, if nobody quarrelled about words, if it were not necessary to take people's spirituality and clothes on account of the boeto, if the two behas made peace with each other, if the concepts beha and aneba were abolished, and if by working together we might be able to produce much more spirituality - thus everybody would be able to live better and the betiks would not have had less either, in fact their part, too, would increase.
Believe it or not, it was then that they railed against me most furiously.
They would rather have suffered me taking sides with the kemons, but sanity they could not stand.
They said I would do well to mind my words as they dangerously resembled that madness shown by some so forthright that they had been burnt alive.
At my question as to why it was a crime they replied:
"Plunging the world into blood, flame and poverty can only be a sufficiently heinous crime!"
They announced that only incensed lunatics showed these desires to eradicate the boeto, ketni, kipu and everything they valued as the splendid feats of civilization which they were then enjoying.
And if I wanted to know who they were, well then, I should know! The lamiks!
This was how I came to know the meaning of the word regarded as the most dreadful of all slander, and for which one must immediately stab the slanderer.
It was the sane mind that they called lamik, as I had in fact guessed up till then but now I was sure of it.
I fell silent.
I had been thinking for a long time how I could help them out of their grinding poverty without touching upon their suicidal idiocies.
Eventually I said that I did not want to hurt the anebas, and I felt that the square and the buku should remain, but on the other hand it would be expedient to assign the many beratnus, waterers and confiscators to the fields to produce corn, honey and fruit, whereby we could acquire much more spirituality.
"Impossible," answered Zemoeki. "Because if the beratnu does not carry the square and the waterer does not water, each will lose his spirituality."
I could not help it, I did not understand a single word of it, I believed he did not know what I had said, and to make myself understood I spoke about how many more flats there would be if everyone were ordered to build houses rather than have so many living in one room with so many others, some even spending the night under the stars.
Instead of replying, Zemoeki took me by the arm and led me to the house which I had seen on the day of my arrival, with one half of it built and the other pulled down.
Now the only novelty in it was that they were rebuilding the demolished part and in the meantime pulling down the part that had been built.
"Do you see," Zemoeki said, "how wisely the k o n a sees to it tits members should have a flat?"
I had already been itching to know the secret of this strange house and taking this opportunity I asked why they pulled the other half down. He gave the same reply, however, as the mason had earlier.
"So as not to cause homelessness."
I timidly remarked that the best help against homelessness would be the existence of flats.
I don't know what was so ridiculous about this, but Zemoeki laughed very heartily, called me a poor bivak and declared that I seemed not to be aware of the elements of the science of housing economy either, which even to the most uneducated Behin is a well-known thing.
I tried to remain calm and asked him politely to enlighten me on the Behins' science of housing economy.
We set down on a bench and Zemoeki began to talk.
He related that once, in olden times, the Behins had built houses, setting out from the erroneous belief that with this they would relieve the housing shortage.
Material justice, however, demanded that from among the homeless only those should receive a flat who had participated in the building.
Accordingly the builders were given a fancy printed certificate by virtue of which they had the right to stay for a month.
At the beginning, of course, they were given the certificate in vain, because only some of the builders could receive a flat, but as the building progressed, more and more people had a roof over their head.
So for the time being, everything seemed to be in order.
However, when the building programme had been carried out, the dwellers, one after the other, had to be turned out into the yard as they did not build any more and so did not receive new certificates for the months to come.
So the scholars came to know that building resulted in homelessness.
I tried to contradict this by saying that if the houses were ready why did they continue to demand monthly certificates from the builders and why did they not let them stay for ever.
Zemoeki replied that it would have been unjust, and that it was lamik to demand a flat for a man who did not work any more.
However, he admitted that the problem was extremely grave and to solve it the kona had employed many scholars with good salaries, who racked their brain about it day and night.
They also propounded the scientific law of housing economy as follows.
"Flat displaces man."
The solution, however, was still not found for a long time, as the problem was double-edged: while building was in progress there were certificates but no flats, when they were finished there were flats but no certificates.
In the beginning they tried to overcome the difficulty by building still more flats, and while these were being built the builders could remain in their old places.
This way, however, more and more flats remained unoccupied with which they could do nothing.
Everybody had already surmised that flat-building work was useful for the public only if it did not give rise to flats.
So they realized that people were to be given employment so that they could reside in them. The flats, however, were to be pulled down immediately in order to avoid catastrophic homelessness.
"But then it is not actually building," I said.
"Of course not!
This is still needed!
This is the kona's wise provision for its members.
The kona puts mattock in the hands of its members lest they should remain homeless.
This is why we have to hold the kona in high esteem."
I was becoming more and more convinced that some strange force was pushing these people away from reality and logic.
Indeed, they wanted to be crazy.
Why? Reality is so simple and obvious, and the mad raving dances demand complicated care and torment the body and soul and still they choose the latter.
I must crave the pardon of the subjects of the civilized British monarchy for burdening them with the description of such nonsense. But let it be said by way of excuse that when I contrast their ways and ideas with those of my own enlightened country, which would not only refuse to accept such things but would not even understand them, I believe I am serving a patriotic purpose, because I wish to teach my beloved countrymen to value and appreciate the life-shaping force of the English soil and the sober English economic approach.
To prove my words I wish to mention one more of the idiosyncrasies in Behin economic thinking and mathematical ignorance, the reading of which will certainly fill my beloved fellow countrymen with the proud consciousness of intellectual superiority.
There were one thousand two hundred konas in the settlement and they received just as many food portions.
The Nourishing and Life-Giving Office, of course, confiscated the portions. The betiks, however, gave only as much money to the people as enabled them to buy nine hundred portions, and three hundred were left over.
These were purchased by the betiks and their entourage as they got much more money.
This is, however, only an ugly and inhuman deed, and it is not about this I wish to speak but about their mathematical absurdities.
Once it was resolved that people's wages were to be decreased.
The decrease took place accordingly, and the next day instead of nine hundred portions only seven hundred and fifty could be purchased.
The one hundred and fifty portions left over were not bought by the rich either, after all they too had only one stomach each.
People dizzily staggered around with rumbling stomachs and the food became putrid while hived away in the Nourishing and Life-Giving Office.
In sensible Europe this is unbelievable.
The measure adopted after it, however, was even more peculiar.
A man in his senses would on such an occasion-having come to realize his miscalculation-either distribute the rest among the hungry or raise the salary of the people.
No!
Unbelievable though it may appear, the betiks ordered that the food left over should be thrown away.
I myself did not want to believe this act of vandalism until I saw it with my own eyes.
But when I did see it, I advised them benevolently that if they could do nothing with spirituality they should not take it away from the Behins.
But they explained to me that that could not be done, as it would have been equal to robbery, and would mean violent interference in the private lives of those whose freedom was the basic principle of the Behin civilization.
And for the rest, they recommended that I should refrain from such lamik statements.
But the best is yet to come!
When I asked them why they threw away the food, they said it was because there was too much of it!
And we have not yet reached the true heights of the ridiculous!
It was their firm conviction that they starved because there was too much food!
And for their follies they blamed not themselves but the circumstances: if they were to improve these they hoped that this would enable them to fill their stomachs.
This therefore represented the mathematics of the Behins!
I think after all this it will be no surprise that they were rather weak at the exact sciences, too - or rather they knew chemistry and physics, but did not dare to admit that they knew.
"How is it possible at all?" the civilized Reader may ask, who has been accustomed in Europe to the idea that in scientific knowledge there is nothing to be ashamed of, and that it may well do one credit!
To tell the truth I myself do not understand this, so I would rather acquaint the Reader with boetology without further comment.
I discovered the existence of this strange doctrine once while I was standing in the yard. Someone came up against me backwards and banged into me.
He stepped on my foot so that I drew in my breath with pain.
The Behin, however, kept on backing without a word of apology.
"If you don't mind, could you not kindly look forwards?" I grumbled with annoyance, but he replied imperturbably, "Today the moon is full."
I did not know what he was talking about and would not have even cared, had I not seen on the very same day at least two hundred people backing who would not have taken a single step forwards for all the world!
Finally I asked Zemoeki.
He laughed heartily and reassured me that I should not bother with it. "They are stupid idiots," he said, "who believe that if they do not back at full moon they will lose the grand-boeto."
I was sincerely surprised and stated with great pleasure to myself that this was the first reasonable opinion I had heard from Zemoeki.
My pleasure, however, soon diminished as Zemoeki continued.
"Of course, not a word of it is true. Every man in his senses knows that the only formula for winning the grand-boeto is that we should not drink water over which a bat has flown."
I no longer dared to laugh but merely continued inquiring and in the course of our conversation the following fantastic things came to light.
The Behins in general believed that the clouds solidified into a stone-hard condition from time to time.
Then a very strange being ran into them from above and split them asunder.
The sound of their being split was the rumbling of thunder.
As to the nature of this strange being opinions differed widely.
They were not exactly sure of his physical appearance either.
According to some, he split the clouds with his horn, according to others, with his foot.
This was hotly debated. The Reader, however, would be quite wrong in believing that either of the parties attempted to present any positive proof of their view.
If I asked why it was so and not otherwise, someone would reply that because anyone who interpreted it differently lost the grand-boeto.
And of this everyone was afraid.
Of course about the grand-boeto, too, they had no definite idea.
It was my own experience that they did not know a single thing about those very notions which they themselves had invented.
Gravitational acceleration they were familiar with; about the attributes of the grand-boeto they continuously disputed.
If they invented it, then why not in such a way as would suit them?
I could at least make out that the loss of the grand-boeto was some sort of disease, but not exactly.
I could perhaps call it a disaster, but why it was a disaster they themselves did not know.
I was often told about some person that he or she had already lost the grand-boeto, but I could discover neither financial nor physical defects in them.
I hasten, therefore, to tell the Reader who tries to meditate upon the disadvantages of the loss of the grand-boeto that it is in vain.
Their words have no meaning.
They are afraid of the words themselves.
It was all the more surprising for me to learn that the hornians and the footians committed homicide more than once because of their theory and fought long and bloody struggles in order that people should imagine not one image but another.
There were even people who were capable - in spite of the knife pointed at their breast - of declaring that the cloud-rifter did not thunder with his horn but with his foot, and preferred to die rather than wisely leave it at that.
What the sense was in impressing such mental games on others is just as mysterious as what the sense was in the whole thing in the first place.
The Reader may already be annoyed at hearing so much nonsense but I have to announce that I have not yet reached the end - and this is the point.
These people well knew the nature of thunder!
When I tried to explain to Zemoeki that thunder is the sound following the electric discharge between clouds, he reassured me smilingly that everyone knew that.
So I asked why they still spoke about the cloud-rifter.
"Because the cloud-rifter exists," he replied.
When I drew his attention to the contradiction in his words he said that I seemed to have no sense of boetology, which was a gross fault anyway.
"Boetology is true because we must say it's true and man, being a rational creature, necessitates that he should consider things not only in their stark reality but to see them on a higher plane, too.
Anyone who is not imbued by boetology has nothing to distinguish him from the brute beast which simply grazes on grass and runs out of the burning stable guided by blind instinct."
I remarked that it was precisely our being rational creatures that required us to try to find the proper image of things, but he severely rebuked me, telling that the proper picture of things was what boetology taught, as it was needed by man.
Even with the most careful recollection of my studies at Oxford, I could not remember of any thesis according to which the human organism would have needed boetology; but not feeling inclined to start an unnecessary debate with lunatics, I asked him instead to tell me why we needed it.
"Because this makes the Behin Behin," he answered proudly.
Of the truthfulness of that I myself was already deeply convinced, but I did not understand why it was necessary to boast of it.
He expounded that boetology was such a firm point onto which the vacillating might always hold, preventing one from taking the wrong way and leading one to a haven of refuge.
"Both individual and society are in need of a point of support. Without it we grope about in darkness helplessly; and without this pillar, society, too, would collapse."
Concerning the solidity and necessity of this point of support I still had, of course, some doubts but lest I should jeopardize my position by further fruitless dispute I asked him instead to explain to me what connection boetology had with backing.
At this I got to know that there were several different commonly held views of the nature of the cloud-rifter as there were concerning what form he took.
One group suggested that the cloud-rifter lived in a cave and smiled ceaselessly.
This they propounded as an eternal truth; and the betiks, too, tolerated and even approved it.
The other group asserted that the cloud-rifter was sometimes angry, namely when the Behin did not go backwards when the moon was full.
Such Behins lost the grand-boeto.
This also, was of course an eternal truth and was taught to the children as such and was approved by the betiks.
According to a third group one could walk any way one liked but it was not permitted to drink water over which a bat had flown; otherwise the cloud-rifter would become angry and the Behin concerned lost the grand-boeto.
And these three diametrically opposed ideas passed for eternal truths recognized by the betiks.
And into the bargain, by the same betiks!
And this is where we come to the crux of the matter.
All these were not only tolerated but supported.
If, however, somebody had dared to say that nobody knew anything for certain about the nature and attributes of the cloud-rifter, that there was no common view, that we should therefore not create for ourselves uncertain notions but remain within the physically discovered fields of nature, he became designated as lamik, his contagious ideas subversive to civilization, the propagators of which were severely punished, and it was declared that anyone who gave credit to the false doctrines would lose the grand-boeto.
I beg the Reader not to slam the book down.
I write every word from my travel notes and may I lose salvation if I tell one single lie.
The most foolish event in the course of my being a beratnu, however, was the bileving of the ear-betik, in which I, too, had to participate to rattle the pebbles.
Grotesque though this bileving may seem, I feel the book of my travels would not be complete without it.
The bileving of the ear-betik took place as follows. Two enormous chained copper cubes were hung on the ears of a betik, then two Behins took his feet, another two his hands and dangling like this they carried him about the yard where the whole madhouse gathered together.
From his ears the copper cubes dangled and yet he smiled.
Including myself, several waterers went in front, then peculiar grotesque figures came.
There was one from the nose of whom long oakum hung, the other held a holed brick on his stretched palm and each of them was smothered under piles of fine clothes while the ragged crowd howled frantically. Many fell prostrate and then jumped up; some took their shoes off, slammed them down and then threw them into the air, and from the throats inarticulate monkey-like sounds gargled forth.
Any minute I was afraid they would strike us dead - which would not have surprised me in the least.
I learned only later that the crowd had been howling not from anger but with joy.
And when I asked the reason for such rejoicing over this ugly and repellent caricature of natural human dignity, they replied:
"Why, there is only one ear-betik and he bilevs only once in every eight years!"
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Author arrives in the skoro - We learn the methods used to warp thinking - TheBehins falsify geometry - Author's dispute over the child's bruhu which he spoils unwittingly
I suppose it is scarcely news if I say their sick brain did not spare the children either. Far from sparing them, they poisoned the innocent souls of children with the most bizarre, delirious lies.
To make what follows readily comprehensible I must emphasize that although the disease of the Behins showed the characteristics of an epidemic, nonetheless, as a physician, who both at Oxford University and during fifteen years of practice,. had acquired no small amount of experience, I can definitely claim that this strange disease is not inheritable.
Or to express it more precisely, only the susceptibility to the, Behinic disease is hereditary, which, however, without the presence of harmful circumstances would never break out in., acute symptoms.
But - as the Reader already knows - the Behins do not tolerate sanity among them and, in the same way as they endeavoured to force me, too, into madness, there is no escape for the child born with a sane mind either.
Nobody can withdraw himself from intellectual degeneration.
No sooner has the child learned to speak than they place their hands on his heart and try to confuse his clear sight, in which area, I must admit, they have acquired quite extensive knowledge.
Their methods were so refined as to be almost admirable and sometimes I had to admit with sincere amazement that if all these efforts had been spent not on spoiling the child but on training him usefully then perhaps they would have constituted the most perfect society in the world.
It was astounding how much energy they devoted to this.
The child is sent to a special institute for degeneration, where they keep on reiterating the most fantastic figments of the imagination until his natural sense becomes confused, he sees everything in a false light, and once he has completely lost his natural judgement, they call him a skoro Behin.
My Readers may imagine how useless such a skoro Behin is in life.
I dare say that in a reasonable society they could not be employed in any job.
Let us imagine, for example, the consequences of such a skoro Behin - who holds food to be contemptible - getting into a food store!
Or what devastation would be perpetrated in a tailor's shop by those who hold clothes torn to rags and weighed down by stones more valuable than intact comfortable clothes, to say nothing of the bloody battles which would break out because one table is round and another is square.
Well, I have to record that not only was the skoro Behin not removed from work but was considered even more fit for it than the clear and unspoiled mind, and what is more, the more confused were the concepts he had about the world the greater was the respect he enjoyed, and the higher were the posts he received.
And anyone in whom the proper faculty of judgement still flickered was excluded from work as being useless.
And it was worse in a case where the person concerned had not sufficiently asserted the appropriate figments of the imagination.
For if he dared to profess what was, in fact, reality they even punished him.
Several times I racked my brain as to what would happen if the wise Hins did not provide for them, and came to the conclusion that this upside-down society would die of starvation within a very short space of time; it would even beat itself to death.
It is nonsense to wage war against nature and mathematics.
I may say, it is only after seeing the Behin statesmen that one can really appreciate and value one's country and her wise administration.
It occurred to me how much the educated citizens of my country had been shocked by the systematic and wanton crippling of Chinese women's feet.
I had no idea what they would say if they heard that there is a part of the earth, darker than darkest Asia, where not the feet but the head of man, his God-given common sense itself, is crippled so as to be unusable!
With crippled feet one can live, but if our feet, hands, tongue and all our senses obey the unnatural orders of a crippled mind, life can be no more than a series of grotesque and inexpedient sufferings where death follows as a salvation.
It was true that these unfortunates also felt suffering and pleasure in reverse, but is it possible to imagine a body whose health would develop by rejecting food and not by consuming it?
The Reader may ask where I learned all this.
My reply is that I had to acquaint myself with the institution of the skoro.
As early as the fourth day of my being a beratnu the betik sent me to the skoro to distribute yellow pebbles to the children.
Taking the tin box which held the pebbles with me, I set off.
I reached a building surrounded by a high stone wall.
This had been built by the Behins, so the Reader may imagine what a rickety construction it was.
What caught my eye first in the yard was a long board structure consisting of about fifty privy closets.
I thought at least a thousand children must be enclosed here, only I did not know where, because apart from these I saw only a small barn-like building.
Entering, I found fifty children all crammed together.
There was no room for a single person more; the air was intolerable.
Over the entrance was nailed a large, shining square.
All over the walls hung pictures the sense of which I was unable to fathom.
One of them depicted a Behin corpse with his bowels, hanging out on which another Behin with bloodshot eyes was dancing.
Another showed a man lying on the grass with the blood oozing from his battered head. He was smiling and in his hand he held a square under which was written: "Oh! what a pleasure!"
Unbelievable!
In one picture something bulged under a cloth, beneath which the edge of a dish showed, and below this was written: "Ugh!"
I saw pictures of damaged furniture and clothes.
A chair had one leg missing and into its back a bent nail was driven; a table had a hole punched in it through which a broom-stick was thrust from the upper end of which hung a mutilated earthenware pot, a chunk of limestone and a dead rat.
Below this picture was written: "Kipu."
Between the children the proko walked looking daggers.
He was an adult whose calling was to reiterate the figments of the imagination to the children until they believed them.
Their methods reminded me of an old acquaintance of mine who had trained his dog so that if he threw a slice of paper to it saying, "It's very good," the dog would snatch it and swallow it, whereas if he tossed a bit of meat to it and said, "Ugh, what a terrible taste," the dog would turn away from it.
(I wonder incidentally what would have happened to the dog population if people of such mentality had led them.)
But even in my wildest dreams I would not have imagined that such a result could be achieved with thinking human brain, as well.
On the other hand it was probable that the Behins, who for many centuries had systematically been crippling their brain, were susceptible to the Behinic disease from the very first minute of their birth.
The proko just walked to and fro among the children and sometimes cried out:
"Kricc!"
At this the children had to jump up, place their left hand on the middle of their back and with the right hand reach under their right knee and take hold of their left ear.
When I asked him why the children had to be forced into such strange positions, he replied that they had to become accustomed to complying with regulations!
Then he yelled something at the children at which the whole flock painfully broke into the vake-vake.
I opened the tin box and handed over the yellow pebbles to him.
The proko took them, poured them onto a table in a heap, went away and then returned with a covered plate.
Under the cloth I noticed the most delicious sweets.
This he placed next the pebbles and called upon the children one by one.
Whoever reached out for the plate was hit on the hand by the proko so that it immediately turned blue whereupon the other children had to threaten him with their fists and shout: "kave!"
Whoever reached out for a pebble was scratched by the proko on the posterior while the rest of the children smiled and said: "ketni."
After the distribution of the pebbles he commenced to tell the children how this gift should be appreciated and how the Behins had attained this for themselves with so much sacrifice and bloodshed.
He then launched into a long story of the Behins' past, which I shall impart to the Reader in a nutshell only.
He related that the past of the Behins consisted of three main eras.
At the beginning there was the primitive or cruel age, this was followed by the transitional or half-raw age, then the modern or perfect age ensued.
Many centuries ago, in the primitive or cruel age, the butuks trampled and practised extortion upon the people.
From the neck of the butuks an enormous horseshoe hung at the back and the people not only did not take it off, but respected them.
(The children laughed loudly at these words.)
Belki then was effected by people putting their finger into each other's ear when meeting.
(The children laughed even more loudly.)
And it was considered kipu if they sewed patches on clothes.
(Uproarious laughter.)
But there came a certain Behin named Zecheche, who termed the butuks base conjurers, the ketni and kipu humbug and phantasm, and demanded the rule of reason.
The butuks captured him and skinned him alive.
But Zecheche already had many followers, and for fifty years bloodshed was uninterrupted.
Finally the Zechechists expelled the butuks and assumed the leadership of the Behins.
From here began the transitional or half-raw age.
However, peace did not last long as the new governing body, whose members called themselves bataks, began to oppress the people within a short space of time just like the butuks had done before then.
They took everything away from the people and gave nothing in exchange.
From the belt of the bataks a piece of lead hung on a wire and the people, instead of overthrowing them respected them and cringed before them.
(At this the children almost burst with laughter.)
The belki was to scratch each other's knee, and if somebody smeared a piece of linen with different coloured stains they called it kipu.
(The children were convulsed with laughter.)
And it was then that the great Zachacha came who named the bataks base conjurers, whereas of the ketni and kipu he courageously stated that these were humbug and phantasm, and demanded the rule of reason.
The bataks captured Zachacha, had his bowels torn out alive and thrown to the dogs, then set out to slaughter his followers with the most exquisite cruelty.
(At these words the children burst into tears.)
However, the number of Zachacha's followers was on the increase. A sea of blood followed for sixty years, in the course of which several bataks were captured. They were tied up, had their teeth torn out one by one, their tongues were burnt out, and they were then impaled.
(The children jumped up, clapped and rejoiced.)
In the end the Zachachists won.
This was the start of the modern or perfect age, when leadership came into the hands of the elak betiks from whose knees the honourable bilevs hang, and whose wisdom ensures the rule of reason.
And since then, everybody may have an equal share of the yellow pebbles, whether he be betik, beratnu, proko or simple waterer.
(The children jumped up and vaked.)
He also spoke of some Zuchuchu, who was in those days strongly organizing the people against order and peace, did not blush to call the honourable betiks sanctimonious pickpockets, instigated rebellion against the ketni and the kipu, and demanded that not the chair but the wardrobe should be studded with thorns, the belki should be performed by pulling the ear, and rule should be taken over by the biteks. And all this he did with reference to reason, although obviously only a demented fool could speak in this way, and would, sooner or later receive his due punishment.
(The children gave expression to their abhorrence, and shaking their fists demanded that Zuchuchu's eyes should be burnt out.)
I may say that not even the most daring grand guignol fantasy gave birth to a blood-curdler more horrible than what these rabid people had actually carried through. And, instead of spitting into a pistol-barrel in their nausea and shooting themselves in the head, they were even glad that they had perpetrated and achieved all this.
(Nobody knew what, they merely referred to "the perfect age".)
Sometimes I, too, had nightmares, and it occurred to me that' I thought I was dreaming.
At such times, gathering all my strength I wanted to wake up, and after a lengthy strain I contrived to awaken myself - into another dream, which brought perhaps even more horrible pictures than the former one.
And I only discovered much later, that it, too, was a dream, at which I made efforts again and awoke - into the third.
And each time I woke up I believed that that was the final and irrevocable waking state.
They will never awaken.
I may say during the whole lecture I was covered with goose-pimples and deeply felt that it would be the nicest and noblest salvation for the Behins if someone with a single blow of his fist were to sweep away this ulcer from the clean face of the cosmos.
Later I asked Zemoeki why they spoiled the innocent souls of children with such monstrosities.
He replied that they did so in order that the children should advance in morality and be able to follow all this as an example!
But let us return to our subject.
The proko finished his tale and announced that boetology lesson would follow - to be held by the venerable beratnu.
I was already afraid that it might again be me who would have to perform some capital nonsense, in the middle of which I would be certain to break down, but fortunately something else happened.
The children stood up, split into two groups and, leaving the middle desks empty, took their places at the two sides of the room.
Now two beratnus entered and the proko left.
When the beratnus came in the children began to beat their foreheads with their fists and began to vake with so much pain, that a stranger not versed in the circumstances might well think that parricides were repenting and expiating their sins.
With this the two beratnus stood before the two groups and began to explain their themes simultaneously.
One proclaimed that whoever drank water over which a bat had flown would lose the grand-boeto.
With such a person one was forbidden to make friends because he also infected anyone who spoke to him.
And it was especially forbidden to drink from the glass of such a man.
The other expounded that one might only walk backwards when the moon was full, and must not make friends with any man who walked forward at that time, as he might infect one.
The shoes of such a man had to be thrown into the fire.
Both declared that the other was teaching specially concocted lies, it was not permitted to listen to him, as everyone of his words was contagious. And they declared in unison:
"Children, be pious!"
At this the two groups burst into an uproar like a wasps' nest, they jumped out of the desks, fell upon each other and a fierce fight commenced.
Some had their glasses broken into pieces, from others their shoes were removed and ripped apart, and the whole time they abused each other with such obscene insults that I cannot relate them to the Reader.
The two beratnus watched the horrible scene without moving a muscle - then, to my profound surprise, they left arm in arm, in the greatest harmony.
My feet remained rooted to the spot and I gazed after them agape.
It was only when the door had closed behind them that I was able to move.
I ran after them and in a trembling voice asked why it was necessary to tell the children such things as had led to these events.
They stared at me as if I had come from Mars.
"The children's character has to be improved," one of them said. "Otherwise we would all grow coarse and turn into cannibals."
In my confusion I could hardly even mutter that after this I by no means understood the connection between the two lectures and the present warm friendship.
They smiled at each other.
"We both serve the same noble purpose, even if in different ways," they said.
"But now we are in a hurry."
Fortunately the proko came and called me back to the children.
Here a new surprise awaited me.
The proko first of all pulled the ear of one child because he had stuck out his tongue at another.
He warned them to be meek, and have consideration for each other. He called his children good-for-nothing jackanapes, to whom the kind beratnu had talked in vain.
Then he announced that geometry was to follow.
Although I did not understand how this serious and exact science fitted in here, I heaved a sigh of relief that I would at last hear something sensible.
Before long, however, everything became clear.
He spoke of the circle.
But as soon as he started my mouth and eyes gaped in astonishment.
The proko said that the circle had two foci and that the sum of the radius-vectors was constant, which are - as is well known to all - characteristics of the ellipse.
It was already on the tip of my tongue to enlighten him concerning his mistake when he added that the circle had one more rule - that it was forbidden to say of it that the points of the circumference are at an equal distance from the centre.
Now I was utterly confused.
If they knew what the circle was, why was it forbidden to say that?
All the same I did not dare to interrupt, and asked Zemoeki only the next day. He explained that the circle had not to be called round because it was the kemons' symbol.
And when I referred to geometric reality which remained unchanged anyway, he responded that there were not only geometric realities in the world, but also anebas and this was more important.
A true kona could not call the circle round.
Simple mathematical and geometrical truths, which are known to and openly, even proudly, voiced by a school child, they denied.
And the most interesting point was that they did not do it out of conviction either - their conviction was precisely the opposite - but because "this is what must be said".
The Behins told lies not only to others, but also to themselves, and it was so deeply rooted in them that they would have struck anyone dead who uttered what was otherwise known to everyone.
I also asked Zemoeki whether he believed all this. He confessed that he did not, but it was still necessary to teach things in such a way because even though he himself was an intelligent man, if the mass had learned of the circle as round, it would entail the greatest upheaval.
I asked why, but he could not give any explanation.
He spoke of some matters needing to be as firm as a rock, a principal support, of some sort of order that needed to be ensured and, of course, of the bruhu possessed by the Behin, in brief of everything that had nothing to do with geometry, but not a single word about what I had asked.
Therefore I asked him again to speak on the subject but in vain, he said that that was what he had spoken about, and that I had not understood
But let us come back to the affairs of the skoro!
After this elliptical lecture the children took out exercise books, and the proko ordered them to write about the manufacture of concrete.
The children set about their task. They wrote, and approximately ten minutes later he collected the exercise books, read them through and finally chose one.
"This is the best," he said and handed it to me.
I cast a glance at it and saw with amazement that the child had written over two whole pages nothing except "vake betik vake betik vake betik..."
I thought that I must be mistaken and turned over the leaves of the exercise book, but there I found earlier scripts, too, under such titles as "How to attend upon the catarrhous patient", "Description of the planets in the solar system", "How to work out the area of the triangle".
And after every title the repetition of vake betik, page after page, coloured only occasionally with such phrases as "ugh spirituality", "perish kemon" or "vake kona!".
Unbelievable.
After this the proko explained some strange, foreign words to the children, which, however, did not concern their crazy ideas but the things of everyday life: table, chair, hand, foot, house; in short, all kinds of objects.
I wondered why it was necessary to know a language spoken by nobody.
To my question the proko replied that it was necessary for a skoro Behin to know it.
Of course, I in turn asked why he was supposed to know it, and he replied further that it was because the non-skoro Behins did not know the skoro language.
Then he explained immeasurable quantities of nonsense: if we walk near somebody who is younger than ourselves by more then seven years we are to keep our palm on our nape; in the yard we have to proceed on tiptoe; on a plank one must put down the heel first; on which days of the month we are compelled to comb our hair forward, and on which days we have to paint our ears yellow.
When I asked him of the aim of such things, he replied that they are needed because a non-skoro Behin would not behave like this.
Presently the proko announced that everybody might leave, at which, together with the children, we departed from the institute for degeneration.
In the yard I begged his pardon for having to leave for a minute, and was about to enter one of the closets, the proko, however, jumped after me and snatching my hand shouted at me:
"Unfortunate one, what do you want?!"
I was compelled to name my needs but he did not let me go.
"But you must understand that in this closet they do only nasty things!"
I replied in confusion that although I was aware of the somewhat nasty function of the closet, we were all frail human beings and my bladder was ready to burst.
"That's why I'm telling you," he continued shouting.
"Do you know what this closet is for?
For spirituality!"
It was in such a way that I came to know that each child had a separate closet and he was permitted to have his lunch only after shutting himself up in it.
And when I asked him the reason for this, he referred again to the ketni.
By whatever else could they justify customs that could not possibly be justified by the sound mind, except by such airy imaginings?
Because it is ketni!
It was a rule, but incalculable and stupid.
A soft-headed product of imagination which I cannot even approach in English.
Puzzled and in the greatest confusion I was looking around and was just about to ask where the lavatory was when suddenly I witnessed a disgusting sight.
The children then swarmed out, and no sooner had they arrived in the yard than they unbuttoned their garments one after the other and before the proko's very eyes they emptied their bladders without any sense of shame.
I was just about to warn the proko, the word was on the tip of my tongue, when I saw that he himself followed the children's example without any scruples.
I turned away in shame and could not stifle my opinion of their loathsome habit. He, however, did not let himself be disturbed in the least in the performance of his bodily function and asked in surprise why it was necessary to be ashamed about it.
"It is a matter of propriety," I replied, in English of course.
"What is propriety?"
I became sincerely perplexed. I looked for words, and it was then that I realized that these poor devils had no word for propriety either.
The Reader may imagine in what a difficult situation I was. I could not even approach it by translating it into a language that was really created for mad fancies which did not exist in nature.
It is characteristic that when I nevertheless did try to give an explanation he replied that it was certainly no more than a stupid chimera without any real sense.
What else could I expect of lunatics?
Disgusted to the core I hastened to bid him pricc-prucc and left, to do my duty at home, and shut myself up to get away from their maddening tortures until my next day's "work".
However, fate, or more exactly insanity, did not let me get away with only that number of adventures that day.
As I passed through the gate a child in the heat of play escaped from one of his mates and, while running, banged up against me with full impetus.
I took him up angrily.
"Open your eyes, sonny!"
The child gazed at me uncomprehendingly.
"What?" he asked.
"Your eyes!
Look where you're going when you are running!"
"What's wrong with my eyes?"
I was almost about to scold him thinking that he intended to annoy me, but with the most serious expression the child asked me to explain to him what the eye was.
"These two shining balls above your nose," I told him, pointing at them.
"And why should I open them?"
"So that you can see."
"To see with the emerald stone?" he said in surprise.
I already saw that the child had no knowledge of his eyes and, in spite of all my annoyance, I explained in a few words that they were not emerald stones, but eyes, with which we saw. The child, however, only laughed, then suddenly turned and run to the proko.
"Vake!
Vake!" he wailed out of breath.
"This man says that the emerald stones are my eyes and I am to see with them."
I did not bother with him any more, I wanted to start on my way, but the proko with a few leaps was suddenly before me, grasped me, dragged me aside, and fell upon me excitedly.
"Why spoil this innocent little one?"
"I Spoil?"
"Don't deny it!
The child would not say by himself that he has eyes and that they are to see with!
He could have learned that only from you!"
The blood froze in my veins.
I did not deny that it was I who had said so. I simply asked why that was spoiling.
"Don't you think it is spoiling if the child becomes acquaintedwith his organs prematurely?
Is it not spoiling if he comes to know what is to be done with them?"
I protested against this most resolutely. I said there was no real sense in it, the child would come to know anyhow what his eyes were for, the organs could not be used for any other purpose anyway, and if we concealed it, the results might only be dangerous for the child, while he could only benefit from knowing his organs.
Teaching should even commence with such things so that the child should get acquainted with his own body.
Otherwise how could he protect his health?
"Oh you base creature!
Is that not danger for you if this tender creature opens his eyes and wants to see with them?"
I was already very angry and could no longer keep my temper.
I suggested that if he was mad he should have himself treated but should not molest reasonable people in the street.
One word led to another, many of the passers-by gathered around me to whom I complained of the base insult. They, however, whether the Reader believes me or not, did not warn my attacker to calm down, but went so far as to turn upon me, and I could only escape by speedily racing away from the lunatics.
They shouted after me even then that I had spoilt the bruhu of the child!
Later I also asked Zemoeki the reason for this nonsense, but he again spoke of some order, ketni, seedling and foundation stone, and I received no answer to my question. So I still do not know what crime I committed then, and I believe that any sober English citizen would remain in a similar state of uncertainty.
This permanent uncertainty and dread developed a very strange feeling in me, which of course is unknown in reasonable Great Britain, and for this very reason let me mention it, first of all for my neuropathologist colleagues, as a matter of information.
Step by step the feeling was overcoming me that I was the one who was worth nothing and could be used for nothing.
There was something which they all knew. I was the only one unable to learn it, because I was without some particular faculty.
They had some special feature which belonged only to them and which I did not possess, so that in this respect they were superior to me.
Although inwardly I felt a resistance against these idiocies, I believed more and more that it was to conceal my own inability, and that this resistance was actually a contempt for myself.
To cast some light on this feeling, I may perhaps compare it to the feeling one has on looking into a river for a long time - after a while, it appears as if the river were the fixed point and it is oneself that is moving.
When I arrived here, seeing their self-mortifying stupidities, I was filled with a certain self-confidence and was convinced that my reasonable help was needed nowhere more urgently than here in their circle.
However, I had to experience that the more general was the truth which I said the more heated attacks I had to suffer; and if on this or that occasion they did not hurt me, there was one thing I could never achieve and that was to make them understand two times two.
Natural realities that a primitive animal knew instinctively, they could not conceive of.
The reply to my words was always the repetition over and over of chimeras and non-existent fixed ideas.
Between the word they heard and their brain there was simply no connection.
This barren hopelessness, stubborn and firmly embedded clichs, but mainly the frantic persecution of common sense convinced me that I was the ignorant, insignificant and stupid one.
Wherever I stepped I always came up against phantoms, while logic and the obvious natural truths were not accepted here as a form of communication.
CHAPTER TWELVE
Here we encounter a more serious stage of the Behinic disease: the kipu - Zemoeki and Zeremble disagree - Methods of spoiling a chair - The superstringists - A Behin professes reason-Debate about the woman's breasts and the butterfly-bilevs - The story of a famous mufruk
For the kipu to be understood I have to relate a sad event to which the fine clothes I had been given by the Hins fell victim.
I have to remind the Reader that it struck me immediately when I arrived here what shabby clothes were worn by the Behins.
Every article of dress was torn in one or two places, so that they shivered at the slightest breeze and in addition they hung different objects from them-stones, dead beetles, toothpicks, bones, etc.
Although I did not understand the aim of the latter, their beggarly rags did in spite of all my disgust arouse my sympathy.
I thought with a certain resentment towards the Hins who - as I then believed - clad them so parsimoniously, grudging the hapless creatures even a thread.
With anguish I thought of the time when my own good and clean clothes would be worn-out and I myself would dress like a beggar.
For the time being I wore my clothes among them with the proud and pleasant awareness of being well-to-do.
I truly,. felt like a celebrated film star after whom all eyes turned and heads wagged together.
This sensation, however, soon began to make me feel uneasy since it was followed by the pangs of conscience which would be felt by anyone of the more decent sort when his wealth is followed by the envious gaze of the have-nots.
I pondered a lot as to how this shabbiness - to which Zemoeki was no exception-could be remedied.
At his knees and buttocks gaped large holes.
At one stage I made mention of my feelings of pity and spoke with sympathy of the poor ragged masses.
Zemoeki nodded approvingly, stating that the betiks also did everything to clothe the masses. The problem, however, was very serious because people regrettably could not put on more clothes - as they had very few.
I felt somewhat perplexed and announced that the fact that there were not enough clothes proved in itself that they would be able to put on more, but he replied that it proved precisely that they could not put on more.
To enable the masses to receive clothes, it was necessary that they have many clothes first, because anyone who had only a few clothes was a poor man.
This was an incontestable and fundamental economic law calculated by people cleverer than us in the Nourishing and Life-Giving Office.
But he did admit that many people went about in poor clothes and added:
"And you can't go about in these ridiculous clothes any more either."
I had not expected such a reply.
Zemoeki, however, explained that in such clothes I might at the most stay at home, but as a beratnu I could not go among the people in them as these are only worn by very poor people and even they only wore them when doing dirty work.
I did not want to believe my ears, but he said it a second time and definitely wanted me to rend my clothes.
I was convinced that he spoke only out of envy, and thanked him airily saying that an undamaged garment was suitable for me. But Zemoeki suggested very seriously and with great goodwill that I should not make a fool of myself; a beratnu had to take care to appear in good clothes.
To this I said that my clothes were good because they were undamaged and he kept on asserting the contrary: the rent garment was better for it was kipu and was worn for this very reason by many more people.
Of course I did not give in; I stated my views of the kipu superciliously even with a degree of mockery, at which Zemoeki looked me up and down contemptuously and left with a shrug of his shoulders.
I thought I had already settled the matter with this, but a few days later I was called upon again from a much more serious angle.
That is, my own betik warned me that I should try to rip my clothes as a beratnu was required to comply with the reasonable rules and not to go about looking like an idiot.
Again I was forced to realize that there was no field of life in which one could cut oneself off from their madness.
They came after one and compelled one.
Now my bread was already at stake and though I did it with an aching heart, I was obliged to ruin my clothes.
Thus I looked for days for what was a truly kipu-like garment, but I saw almost as many fashions of tearing as there were Behins living in the settlement.
Finally I managed to perceive that the majority of people had rent the cloth on the left of the chest and over the right buttock, hanging a swallow's feather and a may-beetle on their collar.
So with deep sighs, I myself tore my good clothes, my only comfort being in the knowledge that I had at least ensured my bread and my position among them in this way.
However, when I stepped before Zemoeki in my kipu clothes, to my greatest surprise he burst into laughter.
"Oh, you poor bivak, how could you spoil your clothes so terribly?"
My breath failed me and I could only stammeringly falter out that a few days ago it had been he himself who had told me that I had to do so and I hoped I had not fallen victim to a practical joke.
At this he laughed even more and said it seemed I understood nothing about the kipu.
This, in fact was not kipu for already everybody wore their clothes like that.
It was in this manner that I learned that kipu was neither that worn by everybody nor that worn by nobody.
Even that which had been kipu the day before was no longer kipu the following day!
I should have liked to know therefore what the kipu was!
Having thus ruined my clothes I grumbled in a homicidal mood for a few days and gave vent to my imagination by thinking by what exquisite tortures I would have killed Zemoeki had fate delivered him into my hands.
After a few days I was sitting on a bench when Zemoeki and Zeremble happened to come along and with a warm pricc-prucc settled by me.
I said a few polite words about the weather to which they responded in a bored tone. The conversation suddenly shifted to the way in which a chair was to be made thorny.
I soon dropped out of the conversation and had to feel that beside them I was but a bivak on sufferance.
For a while I listened awkwardly but in the end I asked why the chair actually had to be made thorny.
"Because it's the kipu," they replied.
"But what is the kipu?" I asked and decided that now I would not let myself be put off but would press the matter with reason and logic until they became confused.
"Kipu is what is pleasant," they replied in the most natural tone in the world.
Then I demanded to have it explained what was pleasant for them, to which they responded briefly, "what is kipu."
I was forced to admit that they could never be confused.
Their minds were so free of the inhibitions of logic which would draw the rein before a mistake and establish a connection between the heard word and the functioning of the brain.
I still demanded that they should tell me what the point was in making the chair thorny. They, however, responded with another question.
"Well, perhaps it is all the same to you whether you sit on a thorny or a plain chair?"
"No.
It's better to sit on a plain chair."
Zemoeki was greatly amused by this, he gave me a jovial thump on the back and remarked that I was a funny boy, I should only take care not to disclose my bivak ways to others as well.
This was already more than I could bear.
What actually prevented me from really and truly giving my opinion was that in the meantime an excellent idea of vengeance had occurred to me.
Thanking them very much for their tuition I went home and secretly fastened some dozens of wooden thorns on the chair and the next day I watched for an opportunity to have Zemoeki sit on it.
For the sake of effect, I even intended to push him into it in front of witnesses.
Fate came to my assistance as I found Zemoeki and Zeremble together again in the yard.
I cordially invited both of them to my room, which they accepted.
Jovially discoursing we walked homewards.
At home I waited until Zemoeki stepped in front of the thorny chair, then suddenly pushed him into the kipu.
He shouted in pain and I asked him with thunderous laughter how he liked to sit in the kipu.
Zemoeki jumped up, cast a glance at the chair and, to my greatest surprise, it was now he who began to laugh.
"Oh, you bivak, you bivak!" He was choking with laughter.
"Of course, it does prick if it is, not kipu!
Look!" He turned to Zeremble.
"According to him, this is kipu!"
Zeremble looked at it, and now both of them laughed. The walls rocked and the delight in mischief froze on my lips.
"But why?" I asked dumbfounded.
"Why?
Don't you see that these thorns are colourless?
They are to be painted, my friend, in a kipu manner!"
"And will they not prick then?"
"How should they?
The real kipu doesn't prick.
The real kipu rocks because it is colourful!
But, oh, why should I even try to explain to an unintelligent bivak!"
I decidedly did not know where I was and they roared with laughter.
A sharp reply hovered about my lips but suddenly it occurred to me that by painting perhaps they meant something different from me, something that would make the thorns blunt, and therefore more comfortable.
Cautiously I asked, "And how am I to paint them?"
Zemoeki assumed a bumptious air.
"Well, listen to me.
These ones on the edges are to be red, and the middle ones blue."
"Well, what nonsense!" I exclaimed with deep conviction.
"That's it!" exclaimed Zeremble.
"You are getting more feeling for the kipu."
I did not know what to say.
For a moment I thought he had recovered his wits.
"It is indeed nonsense," he continued, "because the outside ones are to be painted blue, and the middle ones red."
I realized that there was nothing to be done and drew aside.
They entered into a heated debate. They quoted the kipu masters, and after five minutes they fell upon each other, thoroughly tearing and pummelling each other.
Two of Zemoeki's teeth were knocked out. Zeremble's face swelled like a loaf, and though in the meantime they battered my "kipu" chair to pieces on each other's head, lacerated my bed-cover to shreds and kicked in the door of my wardrobe, I can still claim that since I had been among them these were certainly my first pleasant minutes.
My pleasant mood, however, did not last very long.
No sooner was I alone than anxiety took possession of me when I thought about the fact that once perhaps I myself might be the suffering hero of such a kipu-debate and if people wellversed in kipu matters were given such a thorough dressing down, what would they perpetrate on me, a poor bivak?
Thus I decided to study the kipu, however barbaric a custom it might be.
I already knew that it was aimless and stupid but I still believed at least in the existence of the system.
I set about my studies by trying to meet the masters of the kipu.
However, I was not bold enough to inquire, but solved the problem by flattering them and braising their works speaking in general terms which - as I experienced - was a very efficient method and opened the gates of friendship.
They would not laugh at anyone who praised even if (according to them) he uttered stupidities.
But without exception each of them began to explain the kipu by stating that the kipu was not what the other was doing.
The chair was not to be mutilated and whittled in the way that someone else did it as that was not kipu.
And indeed each of them concocted his own form of kipu and each of them defined the essence of the kipu differently, as if the debate had been revolving around something outside them such as, say, the evolution of the species or the grouping of electrons.
But the kipu was created by themselves, and the most hair-raising feature was that while they were fully aware of the development of the species and the grouping of electrons they had not a single definite and commonly accepted view of their own fantasies.
If they had to concoct anything at all, would it not have been easier to concoct only one?
I guessed even at that stage that I would never understand the laws of the kipu, for there simply were none. What I was still not able to understand is on what basis they could continue to debate it all day long.
The Behins' other rules of life, too, were a profusion of fancies, non-existent in reality, but they were at least rules, whereas the rules of the kipu were known to nobody and yet they still had to be followed.
That is, the kipu meant not only things which did not exist: they did not even know in what way they did not exist.
As if it had been created so that they would be able to pick a quarrel with anyone who had learned all their topsy-turvy rules.
The most apposite way I can express it is that the kipu is accumulated idiocy.
Perhaps it goes without saying that in this second-degree cloudiness of their mind they not only failed to realize in its terrible reality, but regarded the kipu as a manifestation of human intellect of the highest order and were very proud of it.
And if in the course of any kipu-debate somebody had said that the construction of a comfortable chair, the discovery of the serum against tuberculosis, or the mending of a leaky roof were more important than all this, they would have called him an uneducated and feeble-minded bivak.
They were seriously convinced that the kipu was the main aim and content of life and the creative sciences were only good for maintaining life for the pleasures of the kipu.
This disease embittered all fields of life, and also made it impossible for technology, therapeutics and other useful sciences to be effective.
In spoons, for instance, they bored small holes, so that half of the soup leaked out.
The right angles of the door handle were straightened out, so that they could only be opened by gripping them with both hands.
They walled up windows with big unshapely stones at random so that hardly any room remained to let in sunshine, and the remaining surface of the glass was smeared with grease of different colours.
However, they spoiled not only objects but also all the expedient functions of life.
If a Behin proceeded on his way by jumping once and spinning himself round at every fifth step, he took this, too, as a kind of kipu.
At such times many of them also emitted a confused, drawling, inarticulate howl.
And finally, for communication, if they did not use the words whose meaning covered the things they wanted to relate but a jumbled jabber which had nothing to do with the subject matter, this was also termed kipu.
But the majority of my Readers are certainly from the ranks of the educated, non-expert public who peruse the book of my travels principally for a description of exotic lands to augment their ethnographic and geological knowledge as required by general culture, while they are less interested in dry neuropathological analyses.
Thus instead of using my modest psychiatric knowledge to show off unnecessarily by analysing the kipu I feel it would be better for me to attempt a description of symptoms, which is likely to be of more interest to the non-expert public, and in particular what kind of chairs were deemed kipu by the individual masters.
I have already mentioned that most of them drove sharp cones into the chair, but here, too, opinions differed. One drove them into the back, the other asserted that they had to be driven into the seat.
There was one who fretted the arm of the chair so that it could not be gripped, the other nailed knotted strings on the seat, so that it was impossible to sit on because of the kinks.
And there was yet a further group - who said the chair was good if it was plain.
But do not think, oh my Reader, that they had become wiser and wanted to make a normal chair without kinks, cones and thorns.
Oh, far from it!
For them plainness meant that they sawed the back off the chair.
There were some who removed the seat and others who removed the legs, which according to them were only "complications" and "mannerism".
There were those who said that it was still not sufficiently plain and that perfect kipu could only be achieved by discarding every part of the chair.
One of these masters proudly showed his room which was completely empty, and replied to the question of the amazed visitor, "A white chair in the white air."
These two groups were, however, in agreement upon one principle - that the chair is for itself, and whoever made a chair for sitting on like an animal was a bivak.
"A chair is a chair; is a chair," they used to say airily.
On the other hand it was my general experience that behind completely crazy principles there was still more sanity than behind the seemingly sounder ones, as the Reader will immediately see.
There was namely a third group which said that the chair was not after all for itself, but so that one could sit on it comfortably and therefore we should not put knotted strings on the seat.
It sounds perfectly normal, doesn't it?
And now I ask the Reader to hold tight.
For these people, who called themselves superstringists, came from this fully proper premise to the conclusion that the kink was not to be knotted on the string but in the air!
"Because," as they said, "the kipu has nothing to do with articles for personal use.
The kipu is one thing and the chair is another; therefore the kipu must be made completely independent from the chair, so that it should manifest itself in its absolute purity."
These people stood out in the squares, turned their eyes upwards in ecstasy and all day along performed movements with their hands as if they were knotting kinks.
And the crowd looked at them with awe, many swore that they saw the kinks.
Those who did not see, were called bivak, backward, by those who asserted that these kinks surpassed all previous ones.
However, there were a few who laughed at the whole thing, declaring it an arrogant and senseless hocus-pocus and accused the superstringists of being decadent. But lest the Reader should again fall into error. I hasten to remark that they were on the other hand stringists, who held that the kink was valid after all only if it was knotted on a string and sank into our buttocks when we were on the chair.
Similar disappointments hit me more than once.
Such an event was, for example, when a kipu master told me in a very serious tone:
"Those whom you see here blustering around the kipu are all madmen and swindlers.
The chair is for sitting on, and it is good if it is comfortable.
Kinks and thorns are not appropriate to it as they are not appropriate to the air."
I was stupefied.
And when he mentioned that the Behins called him bivak for his views, I fell about his neck almost in tears.
A warm conversation developed, down we dressed together the whole bedlam, until suddenly he said, "What is most kipu is what is expedient, because the kipu is expediency itself."
It was then that a strange feeling of dissonance commenced to take possession of me.
Uneasily I asked:
"But if there is no kipu independently of expediency then why is the name kipu needed?"
"Because the kipu exists and it is congenital in man."
"But if it is expediency itself," I contradicted, "what would be the point in stating: 'What is houndest is what is dog'?"
"Kipu is, and it must be," he replied stubbornly.
"I suggest that you should read a lot and you will understand that it is necessary, as it is the highest manifestation of human spirit, which makes life life.
Without kipu we could not live."
I even asked twice, but it came to light that he did indeed say kipu.
Not vitamins and not protein.
These, perhaps, took it for gospel truth that without kipu they would have perished of scurvy or beriberi!
His words had the effect of a cold shower and with a polite scratching of the posterior I hastened to take leave.
However, he did not scratch me back but stated that the whole ketni was idiocy.
Now was the time for the purifying revolution to give a new and freer ketni to the world, when people do not scratch each other's posteriors like idiots but say quite briefly "reason vake!" and rub their forehead with their thumb.
Again the nightmares from which I had wanted to awaken came into my mind but I was only able to awaken into another, still more nightmarish dream.
These unfortunates have been doing nothing else for centuries but struggling with the incubus dreamed up by themselves, awakening from one nightmare into the next, from one suffering to the next, which differs from the former only in its appearance, but they are never able to shake off the shackles of the dream.
Lunatics who have strayed and will never be able to be men.
Now let the Reader imagine my situation among such people, who, accordingly, did not know themselves the meaning of the words they had concocted from thin air, which they interpreted in a thousand ways and at the same time talked about them as if existing reality were concerned.
This strange decisiveness with which they spoke about their fantasies even perplexes one, as they harangue with such ease and 'passion that a sane man would think that they spoke of something and it is he who feels ashamed for not knowing all this, he stammers for a moment and then decides to learn.
I, too, had this feeling at the beginning, and it took me a long time to realize that there was indeed no sense in all this, and an unconfused schoolchild knew much more than those who held the knowledge of concocted monomanias an indispensable prerequisite for being educated.
It can be imagined what I felt in a society where two times two was said to be five, then three, then, in accordance with all kinds of rules, one, then something else and yet again something else, but never four.
Poor common sense tries to follow it lest it should be ostracized, but it cannot manage it because it knows only one rule, the natural truth, which can be calculated on the fingers, but the utterance of which in these surroundings is a crime, and, what the term is at any one moment can never be known for sure.
Such an unfortunate feels in eternal uncertainty for, strive as he might, it is impossible for him to learn the most important rule: to forget mathematics.
More than once I asked Zemoeki for some guidance from which I could at least conclude as to how kipu was to be understood, why it was at all and what it was good for, as there had to be an explanation if not of its rules then at least of its existence.
He, however, dismissed me with a wave of his hand.
"The kipu is an instinct, born with the man.
Whoever is born without it, is a bivak, to whom it is no use explaining it anyway."
(Although I have made the observation once already, I repeat that it is not true; the Behinic disease is not hereditary.
I can definitely state, on the basis of my own experiences that children of four or five, whose instincts, that is whose senses of heat, hunger, thirst, etc. were perfectly sound, displayed no kind of attraction towards the thorny chair, for example.
They did not show any reaction when seeing the kinks, while at the same time they reached with visible pleasure for bread and butter, and in cold weather seated themselves beside the stove.
Of the Behinic disease the child inherits only the susceptibility to it, which develops to a disease after a lengthy infection during the years spent in the skoro and the Behin society.)
Thus all I could establish about the kipu was that each group interpreted its rules in a different way; I talked even to one person who said' that the kipu was the Behin himself.
I have also to mention the oddity that many things had something to do with the kipu which had nothing to do with it even according to them.
Please don't be shocked.
I have reckoned with the possibility that the confusion in my words will make the Reader distrustful of me.
But this kind of crazy fancy is so tangled that it can only be defined in a confused way.
Perhaps I can illustrate this with an example.
Zemoeki related that on one occasion he had bought a chair at a high price which he had found kipu and the name of a kipu master was also indicated on it.
(I have to remark that the Behins - as the Reader may already guess from the foregoing - not only failed to knock those who spoiled chairs on the head, but even exerted themselves that their chairs should also be spoiled and even paid for the damages made by the kipu masters.)
Well, it turned out that Zemoeki's chair had not been spoiled by this kipu master; his name had only been forged on it.
At this Zemoeki took the seller to the betik who punished him heavily for deception!
So, I already knew that of the kipu virtually everyone held a different view.
But Zemoeki had inspected the chair previously, hadn't he?
So if we could speak of at least an individual feeling for the kipu he should definitely have known whether the kipuness of the chair was worth the price.
And still he was not indignant because it was not kipu enough but because it had been made by a Behin of another name!
Thus at that time I found it probable that even the name belonged to the kipu.
I asked how the name of the kipu should sound, and what system of thorns should be inscribed with what kind of name, so that I should not be punished but he laughed at me and called me a bivak, so I do not know even today whether the sound of the name, the sequence of its characters or the number of its syllables influenced the kipuness of the chair.
I am afraid that I am overburdening on the patience of the educated and sober Reader in Great Britain beyond measure by describing this disease which, fortunately, rages in exotic continents so far from Europe that my compatriots need not be at all afraid of its effects. I must finally mention that the kipu - illness spoiled not only objects but speech as well.
Once I have already mentioned that if someone did not use for communication the words whose meaning conveyed what he wanted to say but a confused jumble instead, this, too, was named kipu.
The Reader, of course, will ask how the Behin speech, which was but a heap of chimeras anyway, could be further distorted.
Well, while their normal speech sounded as if they were talking of something, the aim of kipu speech was not to impart anything.
Those who spoke like that were called mufruks and, needless to say, the Behins did not strike them dead, just as they failed to do so with the kipu masters; they even enjoyed common respect, their half-baked jabberings were printed, and they also received money for them.
The heaps of words printed on paper they called "breath" to distinguish them from "normal" writings.
Why precisely "breath," we shall see immediately.
Zemoeki and Zeremble were once reading the "breath" of such a mufruk in which he compared a woman's breast to artichokes cooked in milk, to mallow root, and to butterfly-bilevs, in brief to any such things as long as it had nothing to do with a woman's breast.
This last had a particular success as it was farthest not only from a woman's breast, but also from reality, considering that a butterfly did not have bilevs.
The Reader cannot even imagine how seriously they talked about it, racking their brains as to which was most similar to a woman's breast.
Finally, I with my poor sound mind wanted to help them and said:
"A woman's breast is perhaps most similar to the breast of another woman."
They looked at each other, then burst into a guffaw saying that there was no sense in that, it did not say anything as - it was indeed so.
That is, there was no sense in anything that said what was reality!
"Then why do you say things of which you yourselves are convinced that they are in contradiction with reality?"
"Because that is the only way it is kipu."
I had no idea how it was possible to debate and rack one's brains for hours about something just to invent finally something which was no answer at all to the problem.
If it was kipu, then I had no idea what the kipu was needed for at all.
I even told them that the sound mind classified all this as rubbish.
"Oh, you bivak," they said.
"It is breath, it is not for the brain, but for the lungs!"
What else could I have replied but that only oxygen was for the lungs, words were perceived by the cells of our brain; but I referred in vain to my medical qualification obtained at Oxford University, it was they who laughed at me, called me a bivak again, and then announced that I did not know anything about the quivering of the lungs, so I should hold my tongue and try to learn, for I was as stupid as a lungless Hin.
(Perhaps I need not say that even the Hins breathe by lungs just like every other man.
It is stark madness to suppose a man living without lungs.)
Thus one would have been prepared to accept that the kipu speech was what was not true, which was not for the mind but for the lungs.
But they were not consistent in this either.
That is, the most wonderful and for a European the most fantastic thing was that if someone succeeded in concocting an unreal and senseless combination of words, they still did not say that it was kipu because it was not true, because it had no sense, but exclaimed: "How true it is, or: "What profound words!"
Unbelievable!
Zemoeki warmly suggested that if I wanted to develop my lungs I should read the breath of the mufruk which they read.
It is very interesting that whenever I had to deny a sound truth they always referred me to books.
I must explain why.
In Great Britain, books are for increasing our knowledge and feeding our minds while with the Behins they serve a very peculiar purpose-to dull the brain, and make people believe the opposite of things which would be self-evident without book truths.
To be ashamed of eating, and to respect the boeto and the bilevs would no more have become rooted without the books than without the skoro.
Still, I myself began to study this mufruk with interest and by degrees I learned.
While he still lived among the Hins this man had wanted to become a doctor.
As soon as he was twenty years of age he became conspicuous through his abnormalities.
He tore off strips of electric insulating tape and stuck them on his clothes, even on his hair.
He broke every third tooth of a comb, stuck the mutilated comb into a handful of glazier's putty and having stuffed the whole bundle into a shoe he set it on the table.
Above his bath-tub there hung from the ceiling a wide-necked blue glass jar which he had carried home from the laboratory.
(It would have been called theft with us but in the free economy of the Hins I cannot use this word.)
In this glass jar there was a ball-bearing, some dried orange-peel and a dead lizard.
He regularly washed his handkerchief in the soup-tureen and drank petroleum.
This much would have been enough to have him carried, bound hand and foot, for urgent curative treatment, but the Hins, who interfere with the individual life only in the most exceptional cases, did not react to such "mild" symptoms; partly because they were not harmful to the public, and partly because they believed that they had some purpose.
They began to take the medical student's monomanias seriously only when his acts began to disturb others in their work, and he became a public danger.
It happened one evening when he stopped a woman on the seashore and began to explain that in moonbeams there was protein and vitamin which satisfied and nourished people.
The woman heard him out and replied that she was not from the institute for food inspection and wanted to leave.
However, the mufruk did not let her.
"This doesn't concern food inspection," he said impetuously and continued to explain the beam-vitamin. He even affirmed that the moonbeam contained the nourishing materials only in the presence of the woman.
"Then perhaps you should report it to the optical or the radiological institute," the woman answered and wanted to set off.
However, the mufruk grasped her, loudly asserted that all this did concern the woman and was already detailing that the scent of the mignonette lifted one from the earth, and that when the moon rose, objects changed their material being.
The woman, who was convinced that the human word was based on something, finally stopped, made notes of the mufruk's words and she herself reported them to the institutes concerned.
There, with Hin thoroughness, they examined the moonbeam, but even in the presence of a female body they were unable to find vitamins in it.
They weighed a man on a precision balance to a thousandth of a milligram then placed a mignonette beside him, but, of course, no decrease in weight could' be detected.
Research work into the material composition of objects was similarly fruitless.
As he had not presented himself at the institute, they notified the medical faculty of the university of the results, where they summoned him and asked him to expound his experiences in greater detail.
For an answer he began to speak about the cooperation of a man's organs possessing an independent existence which was actually a colour that was becoming darker and darker throughout life eventually becoming completely black by the time of death.
That the human voice had a taste: that of the baby was mildly sourish, the man's salty, and the woman's mildly orange-flavoured.
And when they asked him to speak to the point he replied, "I was speaking about it the whole time."
As the situation was no longer doubtful they took him to the Behin settlement where his condition became more and more grave, and he grew to be more and more respected among the Behins.
This was the person whose writings I had to study.
His books dealt partly with the boeto, and partly with spirituality taken by women.
Of the boeto he stated that it was a scent-tree which threw its roots into the lungs, on its branches the kona climbed upwards, above it the shadow of the sun rustled and below black fleas barked.
Elsewhere he declared that the cooperation of organs was an arch between birth and death, at the top of which the yearning of lungs made music, and it was nothing other than a crescent suspended on the threads of spirituality taken by women, and below in an enormous dish black milk ran high.
(Sic!)
This had already somewhat overstepped the bounds of my patience.
Angrily I pushed the book before Zemoeki asking him what he had to say to it.
He read it and went into a veritable ecstasy.
"Wonderful!" he exclaimed.
"How sharply he sees life and reality!
'It is suspended on the threads of spirituality taken by women'!
Wonderful!"
In amazement he almost fell from his chair.
So did I.
But I have not yet reached the end of the mufruk's story.
Once there appeared a book by him with the title "The Life of Man", both the form and contents of which were considerably different from the earlier works.
Among other things, he asserted that a mother's milk was white, those who climbed mountains grew tired and old men were feeble.
Zemoeki and Zeremble read it many times and conferred together at length about its "meaning".
They guessed for hours, but, rack their brains as they might, they could not come to a decision.
Finally they stated that the mufruk's breaths were lately becoming more and more confused.
It was my opinion that the breath had a very obvious meaning, which I told them with no hesitation-they, however, hushed me in disgust.
At the same time a host of young Behins declared that they did understand the mufruk, and whoever did not was a bivak and his mind had decayed with age.
However, my earlier experiences made me cautious and I did not dare to voice my sympathy.
I suspected that behind' the statements which sounded normal still more crazy obsessions were crouching.
And indeed I was not disappointed in my supposition.
Each of them guessed a different meaning behind the statements about mother's milk, the climbing of mountains and old men, but what it was I have never found out and they did not disclose it either. They only mysteriously announced that it was for the lungs and could not be told in words.
If, for example, such a youth caught sight of a thorny chair, he exclaimed, "Sure, sure, it is hard to climb a mountain!"
If some of them rent their garments in a different way, this, too, was explained by, "Well, a mother's milk is white!"
As to what connection there was between these things the Reader should not ask me.
With the Behin it is not necessary for there to be a logical connection between the words.
The matter thus far sounds comic enough.
The reason I am dealing with it at such length will come to light only now.
Once Zemoeki met the mufruk and asked him what the proper meaning of the breath was.
And then a surprising thing happened.
Normality had in the meantime returned to the mufruk, of which the Behins did not know.
To the question he replied, "That which is in it."
For a brief moment Zemoeki gaped in confusion.
As he told me later, at that time he did not yet think anything wrong, and also behind the latter words, he looked for some "meaning", but then, in shame, he enquired further.
"How is it to be understood, for example, that a mother's milk is white?"
"Because it is indeed white," the mufruk said, "as it is hard to climb a mountain, and old men are feeble.
But why do you ask? It is known by everybody!"
Zemoeki caught his breath, then hurriedly said good-bye and the next day he related the whole thing to Zeremble.
They racked their brains about the answer, but finally came to the conclusion that there was something wrong.
Thus they set forth and ran to the young people and reported the case to them.
They received the announcement with an awful hullabaloo and said it was a mean slander.
They almost lynched Zemoeki and Zeremble, finally seizing and carrying them to the mufruk himself.
Here they reported on the matter requesting that the mufruk himself should deliver judgement on these shady characters and pronounce upon his breaths.
It was then that the catastrophe happened.
The unfortunate mufruk foolishly repeated his assertions and referring to his medical practice gained among the Hins wanted to prove that mother's milk was indeed white and old men were indeed feeble!
At this the crowd burst into the very devil of a row, hurling his books at his head, demanding their money back and bellowing that if he had lost his mind he should not take a pen in his hand!
The worship of losing the logical way of thinking reminded me in some respects of a superstition of the dark Middle Ages when they respected epilepsy as a sacred trance and called it morbus sacer, holy illness.
But how much more sane was Europe even in the Middle Ages, compared with the Behins, which in addition to all its superstitions, knew very well that epilepsy was sickness and did not for a moment sink so deep as to admire the high-order manifestation of pure reason in it.
But I think that enough is as good as a feast. Merely describing the kipu has made me quite dizzy.
Now let the Reader, who in sane Europe has not even heard of all this, imagine what it meant for me to endure it!
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
A precise rule for when the Behins are consistent - Author's strange experiences with the square, and the burning house - The Behins' humorists, the phosophs and their sayings - Creation according to the Behins - Their wise men, the makrus and their sorry plight - Author almost publishes his travel notes
I have mentioned many times that one cannot follow the Behins' way of thinking.
There is but one certain point in their nature, namely that they will never say anything; in accordance with reality but precisely the opposite.
But one fact has not one single but in most cases very many opposites and bewildered common sense cannot indeed know which of the many untruths is to be selected.
As I have already mentioned, the sane mind knows only that white must never be said to be white, but he never knows which is the obligatory colour.
Nonetheless there is one case where the Behins' opinion can be calculated, namely in matters where there is only one opposite.
An already familiar example is suffering, the only opposite of which is pleasure.
In this regard I could reason almost always with certainty, and had I spent more time among them, I would have discovered by myself that the thorny chair caused pleasure while to sit in a cushioned armchair was suffering, or if a kemon tore off a kona's ear that was pleasure but having spirituality was suffering.
Similarly inevitably, the opposites seriousness and laughter belonged to each other; of these I will write a few words in the present chapter.
And, indeed, the Behins always laughed at the completely serious things that made sense, while at things which they termed deep and serious the sober European would have laughed his head off.
I came to discover this regularity by a wretched adventure.
When walking in the yard on one occasion, my attention was caught by a man running in fear.
He rushed straight towards me shouting, "Help! Help!
Danger at the gates!"
I myself became terrified; I thought lava was pouring from the hillside or a flood was about to inundate us.
"What is it?
What's happened?" I asked excitedly.
"There... there..." he panted, "round the corner... a wicked assailant... a damned fire-raiser..."
"What is it, what did he do?" I urged him.
"With a chalk..."
"With a chalk?"
"Yes, he drew a diagonal into the square!"
I may say I hadn't had such a hearty laugh for a long time.
"Lamik!" he said in deep contempt and ran on.
But in less than a minute a host of raging Behins came running back with him and they chased over hedge and ditch the hapless creature who had outraged the square.
On another occasion after work I was walking at the very end of the yard and from under the eaves of a detached house I saw smoke billowing out.
Down, near the wall, in a bundle were the remains of a burnt fire-brand still smouldering.
Obviously the house had not caught fire by itself.
I saw that immediate help was needed before the wind carried the glowing embers over to the Behins' inflammable botched up buildings.
I began to run and shouted:
"Help! Help!
Fire!"
I thought if such a trifle had moved so large a crowd, then a real danger, a true conflagration, would raise thousands.
Indeed, a whole lot of konas ran towards me.
"What is it?
What's happened?" they shouted.
"There... there..." I panted, "some fire-raiser."
"What did he do?" they asked in indignation.
"He set a house on fire."
At this moment an enormous tongue of flame darted up.
"There..." I said, "a house is burning."
"But why is there danger?" they queried.
"Well, if a house is burning, is that not enough danger?"
They looked at it.
"That is a kona's flat and it cannot burn," they said, "because with the kona there is order. And, as for you, don't play the fool or you'll find yourself in trouble."
The house, of course, burned to the ground.
But that is not the end of my story.
Later, I mentioned the event to Zemoeki in indignation, but instead of being shocked, he laughed at me and said that, although my behaviour had been perhaps comic, the next time I had better not disturb the kona's peace with false alarms.
"False alarm?" I asked with my eyes wide open.
"Why false alarm if the house was indeed in flames?"
"No house can ever be in flames within the kona, because the houses are of iron with us and are built on rock."
I did not understand how a Behin could say such a thing where there was every possibility to see what wretched hovels they built of boards and mud; veritable fire traps.
However, when I remarked that I had been present at the fire, and had seen the thatched roof and the flames with my own eyes, he warned me severely that it was forbidden to say such a thing because it was arson, and called my attention to a paragraph of law that severely punished the arsonist.
I was completely stupefied, but realized that any further debate would be fruitless.
I noted that the fire-raiser was one who cried fire when there really was one.
With this, however, I began to see the light, and became conscious of the above thesis.
That is, arsonists and firemen are the sole and exclusive opposites of each other so in this case the Behin way of thinking was calculable.
Suddenly I asked Zemoeki whether there was a book dealing with the Behins' mode of thinking.
His, face brightened, he praised me for at last showing interest in rational thinking and suggested that I should read, the works by some of the more remarkable phosophs, from which I would learn very serious and extremely important things.
After all this the phosophs' works began to interest me.
Although I guessed in advance that I was looking forward to some hair-raising stupidities, I thought that it was only with a description of the whole range of symptoms of the Behinic disease that I should be able to perform a significant service to science, so I boldly set about studying the works of the phosophs.
I can safely say that I have not come to regret it.
If all the humorists of Europe were to cooperate, they would not be able to invent fooleries so amusing as these.
The first book I tried was very old but its author is highly respected even today, because - as they say - he laid the foundations of rational thinking.
The book claimed that it was his brain that raised the Behin above the primitive animal which coolly snapped up the fly without working out how many legs it had, while the Behin was led even to that by systematic thought.
He termed his method the absolute pivot and professed it infallible. It was a method which enabled Man to solve all the problems which he could otherwise never learn about with his limited sense organs.
To determine the number of feet that a fly has for example can be carried out as follows:
1st step: The fly is an animal.
2nd step: The animal moves.
3rd step: Moving requires feet.
4th step: The feet are to ensure that the fly should not overturn.
5th step: The fly does not overturn.
6th step: That it should not overturn, a body requires three firm points.
7th step: Consequently the fly has three feet.
When I had read this, I remarked to Zemoeki that the number of the fly's feet could also be found out by catching one and counting its feet.
Zemoeki laughed at my proposition, called me a bivak, and added:
"Other people, too, have said such things, but they had no idea of phosophology and they were very ordinary people, which is also proved by the fact that their results were entirely wrong.
They stated, almost without exception, that the fly had six feet, which, as you could see, is in complete contradiction with the scientific result obtained by rational sense."
Then I read a book by another phosoph, a certain Zum.
Its basic principle was - "The Behin has no mind."
The educated Reader, of course, would be prepared to conclude that this Behin, as an exception, still had a mind.
It is for this reason that I hurry to convey Zum's original mental flights.
He expounded his thesis as follows.
"When the Behin is born he knows nothing of the world.
It is only when he has seen the first wardrobe or dog that he will come to know that they exist.
He has to burn his finger before he will not reach towards the fire.
Thus the whole intellect is nothing but a mass of memories collected from the outside world and nothing originates in the Behin himself.
Thus it is obvious that the Behin has no mind."
Zemoeki recommended another phosoph, Zantim, who was one particularly knowledgeable about pure reason.
This book, on the other hand, asserted that the Behin had only a mind, and no hands, feet or head.
Progressing even further he put forth his theorem.
"There is nothing that is, only that is that is not."
I ask the Reader not to exhaust his laughing-muscles because the proof is still to follow.
"Our sense organs," says Zantim, "are deceptive and yet we become acquainted with the outside world only through them.
Thus we do not know whether ice is warm or cold because, although it feels cold to our touch, it is possible that it is actually warm; it is only that we call this feeling cold.
Similarly, we shall never come to know the flea," called dingas by Zantim for the sake of scientific accuracy. "We don't know whether it bites or strokes, because it is the flea that bites us and not we it.
And we feel the bite through our deceptive sense organs.
The bite (which he called briefly categorial-attribut-imperativus) is felt only by the flea actually (that is posteriopriorice) as it does not feel the bite but bites."
"But," Zantim continued, "the flea is in space, and the bite takes place in time.
Accordingly space and time are but concepts needed 'by our imagination for placing the dingas and the bite in them, but in itself neither space nor time exists."
"And since everything that is, is in space and in time, from this it is obvious that if these do not exist, nothing is that is, there is only the imagination which, however, is neither in space nor in time, so it is not."
But all this was not enough for him.
He also drew the conclusion that there are also anebas because they are not, and that the people are to be oppressed in order that they should live in freedom.
I think the Reader cannot even imagine that the Behins appreciated the products of a mental disorder of such degree - why, they could not even understand them.
Well, the Behins appreciated them just because they did not understand them.
They used to say, "In this is the real depth.
Zantim is such a profound intellect that up to now even the cleverest ones are unable to understand him."
His works were also highly valued because anything could be deduced from them.
Some, for example, asserted that space and time existed and that Zantim had wanted to say just this why, according to his own words, space and time did not exist.
But as they are not, they must be, because only that exists that is not.
His opponents, of course, seized upon existence and said that space and time existed, but were not because, according to them, there was a significant difference between the two.
But why should we bother our heads about this?
Suffice it to say that since Zantim centuries have passed, and during this time a thousand kinds of Behin maniacs have all been hurling quotations from Zantim in each other's face.
And I am the only one who presents all this jumble in such a simple and lucid form.
I must ask the Reader not to take this to be a mockery because, compared to the original text, I, indeed, have rendered it in an incomparably more intelligible form.
The most characteristic attribute of the original text was that even with the simplest possible things like sensation, thinking, or even a flea, a rake-comb or a dish-cloth, it glossed behind tortuous words concocted with hard work that they should be more phosoph.
And there were people who were able to spend a lifetime on this, without creating one single pin or fitting a hen-house together.
After all this it was only natural that the Behins made such statements about them.
"Zum is a tremendous creative genius!"
Or:
"Zantim was a great constructive intellect!"
However, to my regret, I cannot say that the Behins would have shown a unanimous reaction to this either.
Once I met the already mentioned proko who dealt with the dulling of children in the institute for degeneration.
I was sure that this terrible being in whom, precisely because off his calling, all the obscurity of the Behins must have been united in a condensed form, would speak about the phosophs with great respect.
All the greater was my surprise when he made the following reply to my question.
"Zantim was a stupid pedant together with all the other phosophs.
Any man in his senses laughs at the stupidities he scribbled together."
I gazed at him in wonder. I had to admit that I shared his views in full measure, but asked him to give his reasons.
"Real life," he said, "cannot be invented at the desk.
If I were a betik I would put all these idling swindlers to some useful work."
With some suspicion I asked what his opinion was of real life and useful work.
My precaution was not unjustified.
"These dusty-eared loungers don't see that the kemon danger is at our gates," he continued, "and if we don't sharpen our knives ceaselessly the fate of the square will be sealed Real life, therefore, requires us to unite and develop all our strength in the defence of the square.
The phosophs, however, emasculate youth, and divert their attention from the salvation of the knife."
That is, if one Behin criticizes the stupidity of another, he does it only because he wants to perpetrate a still grosser nonsense.
After all this one might well believe that the Behins' "cultural life" was made up exclusively of the tomfoolery of the phosophs, and they have never had any wise men.
Yet, strange to relate, I must say that they had.
But what a pitiable plight lay ahead of them!
The Reader already knows that if anyone professed sensible things, he would be beaten to death.
For this very reason only very few wise men could get away with it.
"But how?" The Reader may ask.
"If the Behins had wise men, that already meant they could not be Behins. "
I have therefore to explain that there were indeed almost completely right-minded people among them, whom they put into two classes: one kind they named makru and laughed at them, the other they called lamik and beat them to death or burnt them.
(To their further fate I shall return later.)
The wise man becomes a makru by a clever word from him being misunderstood once, and from then onwards he may express his opinion almost freely.
Some of the sages becoming aware of this property of the Behins consciously flew to makruness.
They did not rend their clothes in the kipu manner but went in quite normal, intact clothes, which in itself provoked laughter.
They were treated like lunatics, and whatever they said was drowned in ridicule.
The makrus went even further.
If they wanted to say something particularly sensible and dangerous they put a cap and bells on their head and put their fingers into their mouth.
And the Behins listened to them with great amusement, many people made notes of their words and gave them to nurses to cheer up a crying child.
So the makrus' lot was better than that of the lamiks only in that instead of an ignominious death they were awarded an ignominious life.
The Behins jovially thumped them on the back asking them to say something silly.
And if they replied, "Turn to the betiks," that in itself was enough to give the Behins a fit of laughter and make them thump the makrus' back again.
One such a famous makru, a certain Zoltaire, even got into the house of a formidable ear-betik.
The ear-betik was one of the most terrible blows in the Behin settlement, who with his henchmen robbed and raided the poor wretches.
Famine and plague prevailed.
One need not wonder that Behin history knows him as "the Building and Bread-Giving Great Healer".
This monster nevertheless received the mentioned makru in his house, and - according to contemporary notes - he amused his master very well.
Once, having caught sight of the ear-betik, he cried a loud vake-vake but snatched at his pocket instead of his foot.
When the ear-betik asked why he did so, he answered, "Being so close to such a pickpocket, I must take hold of my purse."
The ear-betik laughed so heartily that his bilevs dangled like anything.
He named the ear-betik highwayman, rascal, parricide, seducer and crazy ripper, hoping that among the laughter something would perhaps once start him thinking, but all in vain.
And the ear-betik, in turn, named him the god of amusement, took him along everywhere he went, and laughed at him from morning till night but - to the good fortune and tragedy of the makru - he never understood him.
Some openly described how stupid and wretched the Behin life was, but the konas believed that all this concerned the kemons and the kemons thought it concerned the konas.
And though all the vileness the makrus wrote about ravaged among themselves just as perfectly as with the other beha, it never occurred to them that it might also apply to their own life.
If such a one pronounced, "The betiks are base evil-doers," they said, "He has rebuked the kemon."
A makru named Zift openly described all the filth and horror of the Behin settlement.
Today it is from his book that they explain to the children in the skoro how amusing farces are to be written.
A sage named Zadch wrote that the Behin life would always remain dreary suffering and it could not even be hoped that this cursed race would ever be relieved of their torments, which they themselves caused.
This sage they called the "Great Comforter" because, as they said, "He warned us to struggle and trust in a better future."
In fact the reading of Zift's book awakened me to my duty to publish my experiences gained in Kazohinia once I returned to my country, with which I would benefit science and general public alike.
Thus I began to compile my travel notes.
Through Zemoeki I managed to borrow a typewriter.
By the nature of the matter my intention was highly secret. I told him that I wanted to disguise in a long study the kemons' ignobilities.
So I received the typewriter, on which, of course, there were only Behin characters, and I intended to translate the text into English after returning home.
So I settled down to work.
I described the wise and quiet perfection of the Hins, which then, in that incredible environment, appeared to me even more clear and majestic than when I subsequently reflected on it in cultured Europe.
Then I proceeded to the Behins.
I described the hypocritical oppression of the people by the betiks, Zemoeki's crazy ideas, the behas' aimless quarrelling about the anebas, the stunting of children in the institutes and all the self-torture with which they rendered their life unbearable.
Zemoeki, of course, inquired more than once about my work. I managed to elude him saying that it was still in the very early stages, but I decided that for the sake of form I would write some pages of nonsense for him concerning the ignobilities of the kemon.
Regrettably I left this to the end and thus it came about that my work did not remain secret.
That is, since the memorable fight the lock had been broken off my door and they know nothing about knocking.
In an instant Zemoeki rushed in with a loud pricc-prucc just when I was hard at work.
I endeavoured to get rid of the papers quickly, but with this I drew his attention to them all the more.
I protested in vain. He snatched them from my hands and began to read.
Although I said that all this was but a rough draft which required complete revision and that I did not like my work to be read at that stage, he said that was all the more a reason for him to read it, because he owed it to me and the anebas to be of help in the work of revision.
Zemoeki, therefore, set about reading, while I submitted to my fate and was prepared to be burnt alive.
Of course, right at the beginning he asked why I had commenced with the Hins.
Again I told him that the whole of what he saw was but an introduction that we should better understand the ignobilities of the kemon which I would come to only at the end.
Zemoeki gloomily read the part dealing with the Hins' serene and peaceful life.
Several times a heavy sigh broke from his bosom, and at the end he stated with recognition that the torments of the Hins' comfortless world had not yet been described in such soul-stirring colours.
With this he proceeded to the Behins, while my teeth were chattering at the thought of my poor family.
I must say that I was prepared for anything except what actually ensued.
He immediately stated that the characters were not only kemons, but mainly konas, to which I could not even reply but only cast down my eyes.
And as he read on, his face became more and more cheerful.
Later he simply laughed from page to page.
In the beginning I thought he did not understand, but it turned out that he had recognized everything perfectly.
Interrupting his reading more than once, he expounded how splendidly I had expressed my opinion of the many monstrosities.
At the end he stood up, paced up and down the room, then stepping up to me began to scratch my posterior in ecstasy.
"You have told them off wonderfully!" he cried.
"This book must be published."
The words stuck in my throat.
I didn't know whether I was on my head or my heels.
And Zemoeki continued dashing to and fro and did not tire of praising me.
Once he stopped and, turning towards me, suddenly asked, "My name also figures in it.
Would you disclose whom you want to represent by that name?"
At first I thought he wanted to bring me to account because of personal offence.
Why, all the inanities that figured under his name he himself had said, professed, done!
But he inquired in so friendly a manner and with such interest that I was convinced he did not recognize himself!
This turn, apart from all its fantasticality, was comforting for me inasmuch as I managed to avoid Zemoeki's wrath.
In my confusion I could say only that his name was, of course, a symbol, but I could not reveal who was hidden behind it.
At this he began to try to guess who it could be.
He was suspicious of a beratnu then thought of a familiar betik.
"It's all the same," he concluded. "The book is good, and it must be published!"
At this I already found my voice.
"But the betik!" I said.
"What will my betik say to it?!"
"Nothing.
He will be amused by it."
"But for God's sake, haven't you read what I wrote of him?
I named him a baking-sheet-soled idiot, a demagogical pickpocket, a narrow-minded ape, to whom they vake- vake only because they are afraid of him."
"There you are!" he answered.
"You yourself know what a narrow-minded ape he is.
How do you imagine that he would recognize himself?
He will believe that some of the kemon betiks are concerned, or that all this is a description of the transitional or half-raw age.
Should he ask it of you, in spite of everything, you, too, will tell him that, and that's all."
He carried on for a long time, expressing his joy that I had told all the idiocies of this lunatic society to their faces so directly.
"And that, too, is splendid," he said, "that you have defended the anebas against certain deceptive Pharisees.
You have pronounced it very properly that they humbug the people for business only.
Many such books would be needed to restore the pure cult of the yellow pebble and the square, to rescue them from the mud in which they have trampled them!"
He also spoke of my merits in connection with the defence of the kipu, which, of course, was also manifested in my pointing out the claptrap of the charlatans and displaying bold support of the classic chair thorns.
"Surely," he said, "we need many such militant professions, that we should clean the dirt away from the anebas, and help the many dormant values assert themselves in the kona which are languishing oppressed in the jostling of frauds."
I think this was my greatest surprise among the Behins.
I did not understand a word of the whole thing.
Finally he rose and took leave saying that he had to hurry to a clothes-rending master, as the next day he was due to go to a betik's jubilee where he would be the guest speaker, and his clothes had to be made more kipu for this occasion.
Further he asked me for some yellow pebbles so as to have something to squeeze under his arm with the betik, and he rushed away in rapture.
"And the book must be published," he said from the threshold.
"You will see how that narrow-minded ape will laugh at it, and we at him!"
The proposal was enticing but after some thinking I realized that for the very same reason there was no point in publishing it.
How could it be imagined that reading it would make them even one iota cleverer or would render their life one jot more endurable with such a lack of comprehension.
Should I publish the account of my travels? It deserved a better lot than to be the object of idiots' imbecilic guffaws.
And as to what would have happened to me if they had understood it is better not to speak of that.
That is why I preferred to keep to my original intention and bring my book home to educated Great Britain where the general public, together with the august leaders of my country, will certainly be well amused by the infinite narrow-mindedness of Zemoeki and the betik.
This was how I managed to avoid becoming a makru and a laughing-stock for everybody.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Author explains the oddities of the konch and the namuk - The fad of the yellow-eared and the blue-eared which also sweeps the author along with it - The tragic fate of the Liftmaster and the Dumplingmaster - The namuk's confused speech at the konch - Author's naive attempt comes to a bad end, but he still leaves the konch safely - Author tries in vain to understand the oddities experienced
I must first of all apologize to the layman, the non-physician for adding the description of one more Behin nonsense to the fanciful ideas in the chapter about the kipu, which were burdensome enough in themselves to cause a headache.
Let me mention by way of justification that the activity of the mufruks in the spoiling of human speech described there in detail could not be fully realized were I to remain silent about the adventure I had to endure during the konch where, against my wish, they took me for a namuk, and, according to my experiences, namuk and mufruk were very closely related concepts.
What they term konch is when a lot of people gathered and shouted at random.
For this it could perhaps be translated as a meeting or rally, but theirs, of course, are basically different from our meetings.
In my country it is usual that respectable citizens, organized into associations, occasionally come together so that by mutually exchanging their experiences they may augment their knowledge.
We could also call the sessions of our wise legislators' meetings, where our most outstanding speakers acquaint the audience in touching speeches with how it would be possible to face dangers, to ensure peace and Christian civilization, threatened by the intrigues of certain foreign countries and the opposing party.
The basis of all these meetings is, it goes without saying, a sound mind, without which there would be no sense in the unselfish efforts of our speakers. Is this not the case?
But how could I render into the language of my country the konch, whose only aim is to extinguish any human sanity that might perhaps still exist, with senseless verbal torrents?
After all this, maybe it is unnecessary to mention that they called namuk anyone who at such a konch reeled off either his own rubbish or the flow of words committed to paper by another namuk.
I have already mentioned that at the konch everybody shouts at the same time, but neither the namuk's words nor those of the choir (indeed I cannot term them an audience) have any meaning.
More precisely, the words themselves may have a meaning, but this can be thought only by a naive outsider - because they did not understand each other at all.
If one speaks to a Behin and, let us suppose, says to him, "The sun is shining," he will understand it.
But if he tells him the same at a konch, one must be prepared that he will draw his knife and react by saying, "Yes, he must be stabbed!"
My description may seem perhaps somewhat muddled, but it can be imagined how difficult it is to describe a system whose main characteristic is the absence of system.
I might compare my task to that of the mathematician who wants to represent an irregular curve drawn by a child's hand in analytic equations.
However, there is one rule I can put down: at a konch it is never the intellect but always the stupidity which is epitomized.
It is strange but true, that the Behins' sense is in inverse proportion to the number of those present.
For the Reader to understand what follows fully, I have to mention the antecedents.
In one instance I perceived that some people had painted their ear-lobes blue, and when they caught sight of each other they rubbed their chin with their forefinger.
Among the many Behin fads it did not even attract my attention, but the blue-eared became more and more numerous, and later I saw also yellow-eared ones, who, on the other hand rubbed their forehead with their third finger.
Gradually I began to suspect that perhaps this also belonged to the kipu, and if I did not smear my ears, the same thing would happen to me again as had happened in the case of my clothes which I had eventually had to rend on the betiks order.
So I spoke about the matter with Zemoeki and asked whether it would not be desirable to paint my ears blue.
"Oh, you unfortunate," he flared up. "Are you out of your mind?
Such things are done only by hare-brained lunatics!"
For a moment I almost thought that the Behinic disease was curable, but by that time I should have become accustomed to the rule that I should never indulge in such illusions.
For the time being and for safety's sake I decided that I would leave my ears clean.
However, a few days later I came across Zemoeki, complete with yellow ears, and as I drew nearer he kept on rubbing his forehead eagerly with his third finger.
The sight filled me with deep pity and I tenderly inquired after his health. He replied with a question.
"How can it be that you have not yet painted your ears yellow?"
"Why, it was you who said that I should not paint them!" I said soothingly.
"Oh, you poor bivak!" he laughed.
"You have already forgotten that you wanted to paint your ears blue, while the blues are all base evil-doers.
A true kona, who has any feeling for the anebas, paints his ears yellow."
What could I say?
I tried to reassure him that I would reconsider the matter, and as soon as I got yellow paint, I would paint them. Then I hastened to say pricc-prucc and in the days that followed I tried to avoid his company as far as possible.
One day, having finished my work, I returned with my betik to his office.
I placed the box with the yellow pebbles (after my betik had touched it three times with his copper cubes) on a shelf, and then together we went upstairs, then downstairs.
Meanwhile I had to carry a thorny chair after him, the aim of which I had not the slightest idea about, but from this day onwards, I had to do it after work every day, and I was not going to inquire after the reason, being glad that one stupidity less disturbed my mind.
Once when I had put down the thorny chair, I was just preparing to leave with a loud vake- wake and the betik called after me, "Tomorrow a great honour will fall to you."
Of course, at the very word itself, my back became covered with goose-flesh.
I stammered out my pleasure and inquired as to the nature of this future event.
"You will have the opportunity to prove your faculties for the kona and the anebas at the yellow-eared konch."
Suddenly I was seized with self-reproach for having so easily rid myself of Zemoeki instead of gently extracting from him the main essentials of the yellow idea.
Thus I hurriedly acquired some yellow paint, painted my ears, and called upon Zemoeki, for whom I rubbed my forehead eagerly with my third finger already in the distance.
Zemoeki exultantly stated that the sound conviction had brought me to my wits at last, for which I thanked him with a grateful heart, and briefly asked him why actually I had painted my ears yellow.
With this, of course, I revealed that neither conviction and still less sanity had had anything to do with my action.
But I already knew the Behins' nature well enough.
I knew that for them sound conviction was to be understood as communal insanity.
And I was not disappointed in my calculation.
Zemoeki heaped so many praises on my wisdom that I myself began to doubt the soundness of my mind.
But I was more interested in the yellow danger and asked him to tell me everything I had to know about the konch.
For Zemoeki's lecture to be comprehensible I have to remind the Reader that the Hins only allowed patients to the Behin settlement after thorough examination, because there are some mental patients who imagine themselves Behin, whereas they only have a simple paranoia which is curable.
It was a tragic event some fifty years ago that had prompted the Hins to this precaution, when the Behins had hacked two unfortunate paranoids to pieces.
We know that paranoia by no means takes over the brain to such an extent as the Behinic disease.
There are many who apart from their single monomania think quite normally, so that a layman would not even notice the disorder.
One such patient began to speak about having seen with the Hins a wonderful thing, the lift.
He suggested that the Behins, too, should provide the higher houses with a lift.
His words were at first received with great laughter, and they called him a Hin, who had no sense for the boeto which required the Behin to go upstairs by foot.
"What would you say to that degenerated Behin," they retorted "who, sitting on a thornless chair, would have himself hauled up to the upper floors by a halter, after the manner of a brute beast?"
"The lift brings destruction to the kona!" was the general opinion.
About this time there were also more such unfortunate paranoids who were unthinkingly allowed, merely at their wish, into the Behin settlement.
It happened as follows. Several people spoke up for the lift - there were even some who wrote studies in support of it.
In addition another paranoid began to write about having eaten among the Hins many dumplings made with curd, and, though his common sense protested against the Hins' fooleries, he nevertheless had to admit that the curd dumplings had been good, and he suggested that the Behins should also consume them.
At this the whole gathering rose in protest.
The more staid among them called the new ideas youthful folly.
"Wild-goose-chasers," they said, "who don't want to work and be of use to the public with their labour, but pursue unattainable dreams instead."
Long essays appeared on how the curd-dumpling did not conform to human nature and how hitherto the cause of every famine had demonstrably been the unrestricted consumption of curd-dumplings.
Of the lift some wrote that it imposed extraordinary exertion on man, while others asserted that the kona would perish in the excessive comfort and would not be able to answer its lofty purposes.
"The lift makes one tired and emasculated," they said repeatedly.
"The lift and the dumpling dull the brain's response to the boeto and the anebas!" wrote others.
"Their unhealthy trend plunges the kona into ruin and throws it victim to the ignoble kemon."
"They want to extirpate us with lift and curd-dumpling," wrote one mufruk. "The only question is how long the sober Behin nation is going to tolerate this evil propaganda.
It is our very existence which is at stake.
The lift and the curd-dumpling will seek our lives if we don't become conscious of ourselves in time."
They labelled the comfortists (as they called themselves) lamiks and the matter came to an end by both unfortunate paranoids being beaten to death.
This was all clear and logical from the Behins up to this point, considering that everything was turned completely upside down.
The oddity came only afterwards.
After the comfortist were struck dead, their doctrines not only failed to cease: their followers even grew in number among the Behins.
What is more, some betiks also joined and professed that the unfortunate victims had been the greatest geniuses of the kona, but they had been misunderstood.
When I had learned as much from Zemoeki's words, I asked him to tell me how all this led to the smearing of the ears.
"The yellow-eared are the comfortists," he said, "and the blue-eared are the narrow-minded anti-comfortists who do not understand the signs of the times."
So I understood that the next day the people of the Lift Party would come together at the konch to demand the acceptance of the lift which, according to Zemoeki, had already been accepted, even put into practice by many elak betiks.
"Indeed?" I asked in surprise.
"Then why is there still no-lift anywhere?"
"Of course, there is!" he answered in indignation.
"Moreover, to my knowledge you, too, are a lift attendant!"
I was a little bit perplexed as until then I was unaware that I had such a post.
"Oh?
What?" I stammered.
Zemoeki frowned.
"Well perhaps it is not you who is wont to carry the thorny chair upstairs?" he asked with deep resentment.
"What kind of a beratnu are you if you don't perform this either?"
"Oh, of course, of course!" I hastened to reassure him.
"So, in brief, this is the kona's lift!"
"Well, what else could be the lift if not the lift?"
What else could I expect of them?
With disgust I refrained from further debate, believing that I had already understood everything.
So I was not disappointed in my presentiment.
The unfortunate paranoid had been beaten to death, and they, having not the vaguest idea of the lift either, imagined that it was the chair going up and down.
This was the way the thought had developed until the Behins accepted it.
However, the fact that there existed a Lift Party at all gave rise to the thought that now I might have the opportunity to spread a sound and useful idea among them.
"If there is a Lift Party," I reasoned, "and I tell them that I demand, together with them, the introduction of the lift, then perhaps they will not strike me to death, even if I indeed demand the introduction of the lift."
I decided to explain to them the next day at the konch what a real lift was like, thinking that finally I would have the chance to do them a good, turn without endangering my life.
As far as I knew its construction, I thought it over, made sketches and a detailed explanatory text to deliver to them the next day.
To this very day I marvel at my naivety at that time.
The konch was in that barn, the institute for degeneration of children, where once I had handed over the yellow pebbles to the proko.
Many yellow-eared came together, and in their mutual pleasure they kept on rubbing their foreheads.
Suddenly at one end of the barn a Behin stood up on the table.
His body was covered by a cloth torn into rags, from the holes coloured pebbles and dead beetles hung on strings.
When he rubbed his forehead with his third finger the yellow-eared vaked with wailings which pierced to the marrow.
"Who is he?" I asked Zemoeki who was wailing beside me.
"A namuk."
"What's a namuk?"
"A namuk is one whose vocation it is to explain the honest truth."
When the row ceased, the namuk began to speak.
"We have come here to lead the kona from the greatest danger to the path of the true boeto, rescuing it from the whirlpool into which the vile anti-comfortists want to plunge it so that we should fall victim to the kemons."
The response to this was a still greater uproar.
"We have demanded only," the ragamuffin went on, "that houses with three or more floors should be provided with lifts.
But the anti-comfortists have labelled us, the best konas, Hins, and this ignominy cannot be suffered by any self-respecting kona."
Needless to say, the yelling rang out again.
This is why, for brevity's sake, I shall from now on indicate with an exclamation mark in brackets the increase of the uproar.
(They bellowed incessantly, the difference was only in degree.)
"These hirelings of the kemon (!) did not blush to vilify the curd-dumpling, and are crying from the housetops that we commit spirituality, moreover, in the presence of the yellow pebble (!); on the other hand, they are oblivious to the fact that anyone who does not catch his foot before the square has no right whatsoever to put others wise; and this ignobility has been proved with regard to more than one anti-comfortist (!!).
"We, accordingly, cannot reply to this mean machination and base challenge with anything except that we continue; to demand the introduction of the lift, but now not only in houses with three floors, but also in those with two or even one!
"And of the curd-dumpling we only wish to say to our attackers, that whoever calls the curd-dumpling spirituality is a lamik, or at least a kemon trouble-maker.
The curd-dumpling is good, and gives strength, so we not only not refuse to abandon our demand that the yellow pebble should' be named the curd-dumpling (!) but insist that every kona should be given not one but two yellow pebbles, one under his left and one under his right arm (!!) and they should finally admit that the yellow pebble will nourish and give real strength against the kemon only under the glorious name of curd-dumpling (!!) "
With this he got off the table.
The yellow-eared vaked with all their force, many surrounded the namuk and almost rubbed the skin off his forehead which, according to Zemoeki, was a sign that he had spoken the truth.
So, I already saw that the curd-dumpling also shared the lift's fate.
After another namuk followed in similarly or, if possible, still more tattered clothes.
That the exclamation marks should not disturb the Reader, I shall now omit them, he can in any case imagine the terrible cacophony.
He commenced by saying that he would acquaint us with the Great Liftmaster's thoughts.
He then sat down, took out a sheet of paper from which he began to read the writings of the poor paranoid.
Now I ask the Reader to hold on tight.
The Liftmaster's text was purely and simply the standard description of a lift.
That the lift is a little cabin in which people sit down; then it is pulled up to an upper floor by electric power; and it is also possible to descend in it without effort and walking.
And if I had any doubts with regard to their knowledge concerning the nature of the lift, they would have been eliminated by the original drawings that he presented afterwards, and they entirely conformed to the sketches I had prepared.
To tell the truth, I understood nothing of the whole matter.
Why if they knew the Liftmaster's ideas, and could follow his concepts with such desperate fury, how was it that the lift became a thorny chair to be carried upstairs and back by the poor box shaker?
Then he announced that he would now recite the words of the great mufruk: the Dumplingmaster.
At this I already took out my travel diary hoping that, considering my modest faculties, I would be able to be of service to my colleagues by hastily sketching what was to follow.
My notes provide the following evidence.
The namuk stood up and with sweeping pathos and grotesque grimaces began to shout.
"The curd-dumpling is a mixture of boiled dough and curd!"
Here he lowered his voice.
The crowd clamoured.
"According to my experiences it is a very good food."
Again he stopped.
Then he took a deep breath, raised his arms high, knitted his brows and bellowed:
"It is to be served warm!!"
Dropping his arms with a sudden gesture, he slammed them on the table, bared his teeth, and clenching his right fist shook it towards the ceiling.
"It maintains physical strength!!"
Reaching forward horizontally with his palms, he panted with pursed lips.
"When we have eaten it, it causes a pleasant feeling..."
With this he fell back on his chair.
I ask the Reader to excuse me from describing the howling that followed.
My ears still buzz when I think of it.
Let it suffice that the shouters reviled the kemons and demanded that they should be ripped open.
As to how the curd-dumpling came to be a grudge against the kemons, don't ask me.
However, the best was now to come.
The namuk (the one who had bellowed and demonstrated all this) began to speak about how efficiently the lift served the welfare of the kona.
"In olden times," he began, "the narrow-minded conservatives reproached the Liftmaster saying that his ideas would lead to the emasculation of the kona, moreover the lift would directly prove to be the ruin of the kona.
(General laughter.)
"However, I ask, what supplies the kona's strength against the ignoble kemons if not the lift, which, imbuing the beratnu with the electric current of the boeto, swings him into the higher spheres?
And is there a more wonderful aneba than the curd-dumpling squeezed under the arm, which gives us strength to abstain from the pollution of spirituality, and gives us strength to wipe the kemons' loathsome circles off the walls?"
With this he left the table and the mass burst into an intensified howl.
This, however, was more than I could have permitted without a word.
With great decision I fought my way through the crowd, climbed on the table, at which they turned their attention to me with interest, and I asked them in a few simple words to listen to me because I myself wished for the introduction of the lift and wanted to say some true words about it.
Then I tried to enlighten them in brief about their mistakes.
"The electric power of the lift is not to be understood figuratively," I said. "Actual electricity is involved."
"Hear!
Hear!"
"The fullest truth!"
"Down with the ignoble kemons!" the crowd clamoured.
However, I continued.
"And the lift does not hoist one up figuratively or spiritually we actually sit into it and it carries us up to the upper floors."
"Up to the upper floors!" they shouted.
"Down with the kemons!"
"And the curd-dumpling is not a yellow pebble but dough which is to be eaten, and it maintains the strength this way."
"Strength!
Strength!"
"Strength against the kemons!" came the reply.
"But Behins!" I shouted.
"Let us understand: the Liftmaster and the Dumplingmaster did not speak about the kemons but wanted us to travel easily to the upper floors and eat the curd-dumpling so that we shall be able to remain alive!"
"Up to the upper floors!
Up!
Up!"
"We want lift and curd-dumpling!"
"Down with ignominious spirituality!" they shouted.
Sever al of them brandished drawn knives.
Now I began to lose my patience.
I spoke my mind openly.
"But if you know the lift and the curd-dumpling tell me why you still humbug yourselves with the thorny chair and the yellow pebble?
Understand that those you follow did not intend such idiotic nonsense but life, comfort, nourishment!"
"Nourishment!"
"Save our life!"
"Strike the kemons to death!" they shouted brandishing their knives.
The situation began to be dangerous but this bottomless, swirling morass of stupidity made the blood rush to my face.
At this stage, what did I care even if they were to strike me dead. I could but tell them off once!
Not caring a fig for the dangers I tried to raise my voice above all the others.
"You are half-witted amok-runners!
Don't you think that this way you will not live? Don't you think that this whole herd of oxen will perish miserably?"
I stamped my foot so hard on the table that it was cleft in two.
The fury of the crowd here increased to paroxysm.
They stabbed their knives into the walls with a towering rage and from between their foaming teeth the strident madness screeched:
"We are a herd of oxen!"
"Let's rip the amok-running kemons open!"
The pitiable horrors of the scene suddenly brought about a great change in me.
In a second I was over the climax of rage and felt that I had come to understand the innermost essence of the Behins.
For if on the gate of hell the word lasciate figured, on the gate of the Behin settlement this could have been most aptly written: in vain.
In deep contempt I continued:
"You are right.
It is the best thing if you slaughter each other until the last kona, kemon, comfortist, anti-comfortist dies out.
The mountain, the valley, the cloud, the sunshine, the wise maggot, and the benign tiger will be grateful for it."
With this I got off and folding my arms, with the audacity of prophets I bravely faced the swirling mass of the demented.
And vakeing they surrounded me, exulted, abused, the kemons and the anti-comfortists, and they fell upon my forehead and rubbed it so that my skin almost caught fire.
Then they hoisted me and cried that I was the bravest kona.
Moreover even a baking-sheet-soled betik shuffled to me and solemnly took hold of my nose.
"That's right, kaleb," he said and shook the copper cubes on his knees.
"Not a single namuk has defended the kipu and the kona so forcefully up to now as you.
Many similar brave and true konas are needed for us to be able to drown the ignoble enemy."
With this he stepped onto the table, and publicly thanked me in warm words and suggested that the yellow-eared should accept my proposal and call themselves a herd of oxen. On their forehead they should glue tiny horns that this elevated emblem should also display the boeto which elevates the true comfortist (that is the ox) above the base and obscure anti-comfortists, and at the same time, gives strength against the ignoble kemons.
Finally pointing to me he called upon the crowd to cry vake at me for my beautiful words, and to call me in the future chief ox.
This, too, I had to suffer.
Arriving home, a wild kaleidoscope of what had happened danced before me and it was only after long hours that I could gather together a few thoughts in explanation.
The blunting caused by the Behinic disease I imagine somehow like this.
The basic element of their existence is a grudge against each other which we might perhaps call some unquenchable bestiality if I may at all compare the normal beast of prey which kills for its livelihood with those who ravage against the interests of their own life.
Each group has a certain circle of monomanias and this is what, on the surface, distinguishes it from the others.
This is, however, only the surface appearance.
The truth is that they do not fight for monomanias but concoct monomanias to fight for.
Somebody becomes blue-eared only to be different from the yellow-eared and vice versa.
They fight for fighting's sake.
"But then what are the many theories and debates for?" the Reader may rightly ask.
"If the sole element of life for the Behins is the grudge against each other, why have they to invent kona, kemon, comfort, anti-comfort, boeto, kipu and other fantasies?
Why does everyone not turn on his neighbour with a club without any explanation?"
Well, this is what I do not understand either.
Undoubtedly, in comparison with the wild animals, they have intelligence which enables them to suppress their sound instincts and fight for aims beyond the instincts, even for some which are in contradiction with life.
And their better ego does not merely fail to suppress this faculty of theirs - they deliberately develop it.
Perhaps I understand even this.
But why it is necessary to connect theories to hand-walking which will justify its being more convenient and healthy I do not understand and, what is more, I never will.
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Author encounters the Behins' strangest fancy: the rules of eating for women - We further meet the amusing custom of the Bigrusts - At the shukk, author nearly comes off badly - Time and again he is up against the rules of eating for women and on this account suffers many trials and tribulations
But let us return to my further fate.
Now my acquaintance with a woman entered into the matter and this, I might say, caused my doom.
Their women were in general very loathsome.
The right ear of most of them, for instance, had been cut off.
It was terrible even to imagine the pain they must have suffered and it was still more terrible to look at these unfortunate, deformed figures.
Unbelievable as it may seem, these women had not been mutilated by sanguinary murderers or sadistic madmen: they, themselves, had submitted to the operation, they even paid for it, because they held it kipu.
And the men instead of turning away from them in pity, on the contrary, preferred the earless women.
But they not only had their ears cut off. They tried using all kinds of absurd and disgusting methods to spoil the natural beauty of the body.
They painted their noses white using lime, their posteriors they smeared with a stinking, sticky blue paint and kept them naked, while on their stomachs they tied thick pillows, and as to their mouths-as we already know - they kept them permanently covered with handkerchiefs.
The woman, by the way, whom my wretched fate brought across my path, was called Zukrula, and I made her acquaintance at a shukk.
At that time I myself did not know what a shukk was. Zemoeki told me the news on one occasion that there would be a shukk that day, and suggested that I should go to it as it would be very interesting.
Out of curiosity, I went with Zemoeki and Zeremble.
On the way, it struck me that at the foot of the trees some tin sheets completely eaten with rust had been set up which I had not seen there the day before.
I asked why they did not move them out of the way; somebody might be injured by them.
In reply I was given a most resentful look.
"I would have you know," said Zemoeki, "that they are the Bigrusts which are displayed on solemn occasions."
From this I understood only that I had made a blunder again, so, much more softly and with respect, I inquired after the nature of the Bigrusts, at which it came to light that that too, was an aneba.
"I'm no boaster," Zeremble said, "but I can tell you that my sheet of iron became holed with rust no less than eighty years ago."
And he looked around proudly.
But Zemoeki remarked that on his sheet of iron the rust was already two inches thick.
Now I was very curious and, to avoid any blunder, on the basis of my previous experiences, I flatteringly praised Zemoeki's Bigrust though I had no idea what that signified.
This method did indeed open their hearts and while we proceeded they explained every rusty sheet of iron.
I had to stand for a long time in front of Zeremble's Bigrust, as he called my attention to every hole.
It was undoubtedly in a very pitiable state, and was saved from falling apart only by being nailed onto a board.
And with a folding ruler Zemoeki measured the thickness of the individual Bigrusts and any that were thinner than his own - even by a hair's breadth - he called brand new, a usable piece, and made derogatory remarks about it.
About one he said that the proprietor might do better to make a bowl for his spirituality out of it, at which even Zeremble looked round in fear and warned him of the ketni.
Zemoeki, however, was in his element.
One particularly impressive layer of rust he pronounced a forgery, the proprietor having glued it onto the sheet.
He expressed his surprise that he had not yet been punished for false rusting.
Of another he claimed it did not belong to the man in question, but he had suddenly become a betik, and he had purchased it from a rust-owner who was now reduced to poverty.
"Although," he said, "everybody knows that he was not even born here. Twenty years ago he worked outside as an ordinary and rough designer of elevated railways; his fingers are still gnarled from the compasses.
Regrettably, however, it is not possible to take steps against him because he sits in the Rust Measuring and Record Office."
He was greatly indignant that the cause of public rust was committed to the charge of such people.
However, he did not omit to emphasize that his - that is Zemoeki's - great-grand-father had been brought in when he ate his shoes, and he, too, was a remarkable man within the community: it was he who succeeded in bringing about the squeezing of the yellow pebble under the right arm instead of the left. His grandfather skinned a kemon alive. For weeks he greased his earlobe with his fat, for which many people admired him, but there were also those who envied him, as is usual with great men. As for his father, he was a great scientist, one of the founders of ellipsology. He had established why the circle was an ellipse for the kona, as a result of which he significantly contributed to bringing to the surface the specific popular sciences latent in the kona.
Conversing in this fashion we arrived at the shukk.
We reached an enclosed area outside the rail of which many people were standing.
We had scarcely been there two minutes when two Behins suddenly dashed into the enclosure, eyes flashing with fury, and huge clubs in their hands.
They began to thrash each other about the head and back and within a short space of time blood was streaming all over the place and their skin hung in shreds.
I cried for help, even the crowd began to shout inarticulately, but nobody attempted to separate them.
Finally, I myself jumped over the rail but they grasped me and pulled me out.
I demanded the separation of the adversaries in vain. They answered that it was a shukk and I should keep my mouth shut.
The fight ended when the skull of one of the fighters caved in with a loud crack; the crowd gave a yell, rushed into the field, surrounded the murderer, vaked to him, scratched the pants on his posterior into rags until he, too, collapsed because of the loss of blood and the strain on the heart.
And when I indignantly asked the by-standers how they could tolerate such a barbaric settling of differences, they said that they had not been enemies and that this was a shukk which was for developing health.
And I referred in vain to my medical degree from Oxford University, claiming that a man with a broken skull was less healthy than a sound one, and only madmen cracked each other's head in cold blood; it was they who became enraged, fists rose, and I would certainly not have been able to avoid being lynched if I had not been quick to take to my heels.
This, therefore, was how I learned the essence of the shukk.
If someone strikes a fellow human being dead, he will be punished.
But if he first utters the magic word shukk he will be excused!
With the Behins everything depends on the words.
And it was quite lucky that they did not punish those who did not want to have their heads broken on the score of the shukk!
Of course, the Reader considers this last sentence a feeble witticism and smiles at my words.
To my regret I have to interrupt his pleasure because there was actually also a magic word which, if the murderer pronounced it, not only exempted him from punishment, but they punished one who did not want to kill.
This was the buku.
But of this I shall speak later.
Now I had better perhaps not comment on this sort of madness, all the more so as I later became involved in a much more serious affair which did in the end literally ruin me.
Among the spectators of the shukk I noticed a woman emaciated to the bone and on her last legs.
In her hand the handkerchief trembled and she could hardly press it to her mouth.
In spite of my disgust I was moved to pity.
Her weakness was so deplorable that as a physician I was unable to look upon her without a helping word.
I was somewhat perplexed, I looked for words to suggest, without offending the ketni, better nourishment for her, and finally I decided that, instead of the egg-dance of uneasy explanations, I would offer her, in a chivalrous manner, a part of my spirituality.
In order to do this I stepped up to her and made the offer that I would willingly abandon my dispensable spirituality available at home for her consumption.
The Reader would never have believed what a heated reproach I received in answer.
She called me a bivak, who had no idea of the ketni. She asked what kind of a woman I took her for? Did I really think that she would be able to perpetrate such a foul deed?
"Are you thinking of eating?" - the words slipped out.
"Ugh!
Bivak!" she screamed.
"How can you imagine that I would even think of such things!
And if you were to say it, then it should never have been said in such a way!"
But seeing her lamentable state and obvious hunger which she was not even able to conceal, my most basic human feelings dictated that I should violate the rules and satisfy her hunger - why, she was about to collapse.
So I said, "Whatever we say, the truth is that we all take spirituality."
Squealing with anger she fell upon me asking what did I imagine? That she should need such a horrid thing?
She had never desired it in all her life for she was not that sort of woman and that I should not forget that.
Any ketni man, by the way, would never behave like this on such an occasion but would ask whether she had wanted the bikbam and would not abuse a defenceless female.
This was where I committed my next blunder.
This confirmed stubbornness of stupidity made me lose my temper and I did not leave it at that.
I let her know that I was a physician, I recommended that she should look into a mirror and she would see how the hunger was visible on her. That after all, there was nothing to be ashamed of. Why, we all ate which was sufficiently proved by the fact that we existed.
I guessed that she would at least take offence but I no longer cared, after all I had nothing to lose by it, and with my advice she would gain.
Of course what actually happened would have been beyond my wildest dreams.
The woman gasped for breath and then cried for help at the top of her voice. The guards gathered round and she lied to them that I had attacked her and wanted to rob her of something.
What it was she did not disclose, of course, but only spoke of some dearest treasure of hers even though she had nothing worth a penny on her.
This audacious slander repelled me and I announced that not only had I not wanted to take anything from her, I had wanted to give her a share in the pleasure of spirituality.
Then followed my real surprise.
The guards had a good laugh at my words, called me a fool, stated that that was precisely the point at issue, and dragged me before the betik who in turn sentenced me to a week's imprisonment because I had wanted to feed a woman!
I did not want to believe my ears and could not even defend myself for astonishment, but stood as though paralysed with no control over my thoughts or what was happening to me.
I had been imprisoned for some hours before I could sufficiently arrange my thoughts to enable me to understand the situation.
I had been jailed like some pickpocket and why?
Because I had been good and sober.
After my discharge I complained to Zemoeki indignantly, but instead of sympathizing he laughed at me, called me a bivak and began teaching me the ketni.
Although the superciliousness of a lunatic annoyed me, I tried nevertheless to hear him through with patience hoping that with what I "acquired" I would be able at least to steel myself against similar traps.
I am bound to say that hair-raising things came to light.
I already knew that eating passed as an impropriety but so far as women were concerned the sorts of tortuous ideas that were assigned to it I would never have believed.
Now I came to know, for example, that they wore a pillow over the stomach and a handkerchief on the mouth because both organs were connected with eating.
It was forbidden even to mention the mouth.
One had to make out that women had no mouth.
Of course from the European point of view this seems to be unbelievable - that one should hold one's natural and honest function of life to be shameful - that we should think in such a way about something without which we could not even live, but the tortuous way in which the women had to conceal it defied all imagination.
If a man and a woman came together both spoke as if they had no idea that such a thing as a mouth existed, though both of course knew that it did and moreover that this was known by the other.
They named the mouth only when it was inevitably necessary, and even then in a periphrastic manner in terms prepared especially for the observation of the ketni calling it now midface then thoughtflower, though it had nothing to do with thought, just like spirituality, as it was even denied that this was eaten by people but had to be mentioned as if it were carried away by the stork.
Of course, everybody realized that they themselves lied as well as knowing that others knew that they lied.
And the miserable women carried this loathsome bundle of lies throughout their lives with no sense of shame or decency and without raising a protesting voice at any time!
I, who am purely and simply describing all this, gave a great deal of thought whether it would be at all proper to publish such monstrosities.
Certainly among my Readers there will be a fair number of my country's chaste and ingenuous maidens who, having been brought up in the sound European civilization, have always learned that to lie is immoral, and who will surely not be able to read all this without blushing.
May it serve as my justification that when I remember the shameless Behin women I cannot stifle my rightful patriotic pride.
As to the monomania of wearing a handkerchief, I can relate one fantastic episode.
On one occasion a woman appeared in the yard with her mouth uncovered.
My Readers cannot possibly imagine the resulting scandal.
The bystanders blushed and turned away, they covered their eyes, the women ran screaming in all directions, and at the end the guard came and took the woman away.
But the interesting point was the explanation they said that the woman - had gone mad!
I would still have liked to know what the bikbam was that the woman had spoken of and which I would have come to know had she wished it. But after so many failures I did not dare to ask because, although I was sure that this, too, would be some concocted nonsense, I did not feel a bit like adding fresh fuel to Zemoeki's derision and humiliating superciliousness.
They laugh at anyone who does not know the concocted wordproducts of their fantasy.
If, on the other hand, somebody does not know what an ecliptic or pancreas is, they view him with respect as it adds to his distinction.
So that I should discover without being laughed at what the bikbam was, following my discharge I again called upon the woman concerned and asked her, first of all, to excuse me for my earlier bivak behaviour, then asked her whether she had wished the bikbam.
The woman's face became considerably friendlier, she stated that she kvared my words, did not enoate because of me, and as to the bikbam, she had wished it.
So I managed to make her acquaintance.
That was when I came to know that she was called Zukrula.
We started out for a walk and were joined by Zemoeki and, considering my lack of resources, the conversation could be called sufficiently smooth.
I tried to choose subjects to which I hoped that the shackles of ketni, kipu and other freaks did not apply.
Of course, even so, I burnt my fingers right at the start.
With my headstrong approach, I dared to utter the seemingly innocent sentence, "The sky is blue."
(I thought that with this no possible difficulties could arise.)
But Zukrula emphatically replied, "Yes, it was blue."
"It is now, too," I answered ingenuously and received a contemptuous look in reply. I blushed and under some pretext called Zemoeki aside to ask him about the matter. However, no sooner were we in private than he heaped reproaches on me; how could I speak in the present tense in the presence of a woman?
Thus it came to light that in a conversation between a man and a woman, every verb had to be in the past tense; one could speak in the present tense only to a woman who had already taken off her mouthkerchief in one's presence.
Returning, I was at pains to observe this requirement but, I may say, the compulsory past tense caused me the greatest confusion on several occasions as I did not know whether the present or the past was concerned.
I have no idea why they do it.
Why! Doesn't speech exist in order to communicate actual ideas and, moreover, without endeavouring to cause misunderstanding?
But we had scarcely begun to continue our conversation when Zemoeki again called me aside and asked with resentment in his voice, why I kept calling her Zukrula, and why didn't I call her Zaikuebue.
"Because she is called Zukrula," I answered simply.
"Just call her Zaikuebue."
"She herself has said that she is Zukrula."
"Oh you bivak!" laughed Zemoeki.
"She says it because ketni does not permit her to do otherwise, but you should address her as Zaikuebue."
Somebody else might well have gone mad in my place and I realized only then how much one can endure.
Thus we returned and the conversation continued.
Gradually Zukrula became kinder to me again and then asked me to touch with her a buipiff.
Somewhat frightened I looked at Zemoeki as I was unaware of what kind of new trap awaited me, but he reciprocated my glance with a reassuring wink that I might do this safely.
Even so, of course, things were far from being in order, and I stammered out my confession that I was unversed in the buipiff. This elicited a contemptuous pouting from Zukrula and she remarked that it seemed that the men today received a rather theoretical education which did not meet the requirements of practical life.
Eventually Zemoeki came to my help and explained the matter.
The buipiff consists of a man and a woman touching the tips of their fingers in accordance to different arrangements of sequence and rhythm.
Once the man's thumb touches the woman's third finger, then the third finger the little one, then again the third finger and the little finger the woman's forefinger, and so on; and from time to time they point at each other's mouth.
The buipiff has a thousand variations, the only common gesture being the pointing at the mouth which occurs in each of them. But what they point at is kept strictly secret because they are ashamed of it, and mention it only as the phagmak figure.
I have no idea why they are ashamed of it, and if they are ashamed of it why they do it.
I also came to know that the buipiff was usually performed to music.
This came in useful in so far as when I turned out to be a very blockheaded pupil, I could say by way of excuse that I could certainly have done it better to music.
They suggested instead that we should go for a walk on the hillside.
We set off.
Zukrula at this point suddenly expressed the wish that she would very much like to have a butterfly with dark-brown wings striped with blue.
After a lengthy, chase I managed to catch one for her, but it was not suitable because it was dark-brown with blue stripes, whereas she would have preferred a blue-winged one with brown stripes, whose wings she would cut off, frill and glue onto the bristles of her clothesbrush as it would look good.
She had always desired a man who carried out all her orders; a strong and tyrannous one who would whip his woman if she did not obey.
Then it occurred to her that she would like to see a rainbow the arch of which was down and the foot up, and she did not understand what science was for if they were unable to produce this; that it would be good to run with open arms in hot snow, and it would be good to say everything at one breath but without sound because only that was true speech, and we could attain perfection if we did not speak; and paint our forehead yellow; and what I would say to that scientist who had recently discovered the solution to all integral equations whether it was true that it was his habit to cover his spirituality with a red-and-lilac kerchief, for I should note that he had made a great impression on her, and she wore a copy of his article on her midface in her mouthkerchief.
I heard in surprise these words which had a familiar ring; they were so strangely different from the madness of the Behins which melted into paroxysm.
I even realized, that Zukrula's chatter, her whims, ideas were a veritable relaxation for me because they definitely reminded me of the sweet chatter of the ladies in my beloved country, of their petty problems and the music of a thousand variations emanating from the lovely female soul which makes the weaker sex so exciting, mysterious and desirable, and induces men to dash off in pursuit of the beautiful creature, to catch her, to solve the mystery, the real and tangible content that excitingly hides among the trills and fugues of the rhapsodic moods - or at least we believe that there is something to hide.
I must say that at that moment I did not feel so out of place, I even joined in the chattering happily stating that although the Behins turned every custom and institution upside down, they were not able to divest the female soul of its true and natural character.
But my pleasure did not last for long because Zukrula suddenly asked, "My little finger was thinner than my thumb, wasn't it?"
This, of course, had to be understood in the present tense.
Although the question was ridiculous, I was already accustomed to it and instead of laughing I obligingly inspected her hand and agreed with clear conscience, that her little finger was indeed thinner.
At this Zukrula jumped up and looked me up and down with flashing eyes.
"Bivak!" she cried and then added, "And as to the bikbam, I did not wish it!
So it was out of question!" and she ran away.
I gazed idiotically at Zemoeki who without waiting for my question heaped abuse on me yet again. He, too, called me a bivak, and it took some minutes before he could calm down sufficiently for me to ask for an explanation.
This was how I learned that it was the strict obligation of a man to qualify the woman's little finger as thicker than her thumb and anyone who failed to do so perpetrated a kave thing.
The normal Reader, of course, might well feel that there were some natural grounds for this: that they made the thumb thinner in some way or something like that.
I have to affirm that this is not so.
Their fingers are just like those of anyone else, but somebody has conjured up the idea that a thinner thumb is something to be proud of and though everybody knows this is not true of anybody, one still has to say so, to assert it, and even to argue with the woman who says that her little finger is thinner while the man claims it is thicker.
Then they debate about it for hours, and the woman is happy, although she is well aware the whole time that the man is lying.
While other people honour each other by telling the truth, the measure of honouring each other with the Behins is the ability to tell the greatest lie.
For the madness to be complete, I also mention the rule of the ketni that all this may only be stated about the woman to whom we are speaking.
To say it of another woman is the greatest insult to the one present.
The question of the bikbam gave me no rest, so the next day I again called upon Zukrula, anew I offered my apologies, assuring her that she had misheard, I had not said thinner but thicker.
As I had now lied doubly, Zukrula was appeased, and I urged her to tell me whether she had wished the bikbam.
(The Reader is already aware of the function of the past tense.)
Zukrula became very kind once more, she announced that this way it was quite different, and as for the bikbam, she had wished it.
With this she took me together with Zemoeki and Zeremble to a betik who fastened the baking-sheets upon his soles, and then unfastened them and took them off.
This he did three times, then threw a heated copper cube into some water, half of which he drank; having wrapped the cube into a punched cloth he hit both of us on the head, unwrapped it, and asked me for money.
I found the sum a little too much; however, as I did not dare to mention it inside, I broached it to Zemoeki after coming out suggesting that for such a short bikbam the betik could have asked less. However, Zemoeki benevolently explained that the money was not for the betik but for the bikru.
I vehemently protested saying that the bikru was a concept and one cannot pay a concept, besides I had seen with my own eyes that the betik had taken the money, but Zemoeki reproachingly warned me that it was kave to say such a thing and that I had again made an unfortunate reference to my eyes.
I should therefore note once and for all that I had given the money to the bikru.
As to what the bikru meant I was not, of course, at all aware; I only gathered that it was a concept concocted to unify the reasons for all bad things.
If they confiscated my food, it was carried away by the bikru, my money I paid to the bikru.
If somebody died of a sickness he was killed not by the germs but by the bikru.
If he fell from the roof-top it was the bikru who had pushed him off.
When Zemoeki egged me on to beat the kemons, I had to note that it was not he but the bikru who had compelled me to fight.
It was on account of the bikru that one had to feed on pebble instead of food, to vake for the betik, to water the grass, to burn clothes, and in general for the whole topsy-turvy life and its being unbearable they blamed the bikru which was ideally suited for excusing the germs, fire, water, confiscators, and most of all the betiks of all responsibility.
The Reader may imagine, after all this, how every trouble and disease was rife here and they were unable to perceive the simple and obvious reasons, which even one of our schoolchildren would have known.
However, a dramatic turn of events ensued.
After the bikbam we took leave of Zemoeki and Zeremble with a warm pricc-prucc, then Zukrula grasped me and started at the double towards my flat.
"Did you, perhaps, want to come to me?" I asked.
"I most certainly do," she said decisively.
"What?" I was struck dumb with surprise at the unexpected present tense.
"Was it now ketni for you to speak so?"
"Don't tease me," Zukrula chided.
"Have you already forgotten the striking on the head with the copper cube?"
No sooner had we arrived home than Zukrula slammed the door to and removing her handkerchief from her mouth, she gasped in choking ecstasy.
"Feed me, please, I'm suffering the pangs of hunger, let me have that food, stuff it into my mouth, into my stomach so that I'll be satisfied at last!"
It gave me the creeps.
She revelled in the forbidden words to such an extent that I, who had gradually become accustomed to the ketni, ran out in alarm lest I should be imprisoned again.
And Zukrula ran after me screaming abuse.
I flew with my hands on my ears lest I should fall under the suspicion that I had even listened to such horrible words.
My Readers can have no idea what happened next.
They dragged me off to the betik again who sentenced me to one month's imprisonment because I had NOT fed a woman!
As I came to know later, as a result of the bikbam, everything that had been forbidden and was shameful before, afterwards became a duty to be performed and everything that had been ketni before became kave afterwards!
My Readers, if they believe any of this at all, must be holding their sides with laughter reading the comic adventures of a sane man among the lunatics. The piquancy of this is provided by the paradoxical situation whereby I did everything to follow their ideas with my unfortunately sane mind in order to avoid their being shocked and everything turned out in reverse because it is the essence of the Behins' madness that they are: not consistent even in their madness.
After the month was up and I was discharged, 1 wanted' at any rate to get to the bottom of how things were in connection with the rules of eating for women.
So from then on I paid more attention to the women.
Once 1 saw one who, on passing me, stealthily, so that nobody else should see it, momentarily lifted her handkerchief from her mouth, from which I concluded that she was hungry but did not dare to let me know openly.
I rejoiced at the opportunity; I hoped I would be able to learn a lot through her.
I therefore joined her and in a roundabout way I asked her her opinion of spirituality. At this she hurriedly called me aside and whispered frankly that she was, indeed, hungry and would be happy if she could have some of my spirituality.
I admit, these words surprised me very pleasantly.
Foolishly, I believed that I had found the first woman of sound mind whose words had some connection with the natural world.
I led her into my room and uncovered my food for her with good heart.
The woman sat down opposite me and fell upon my spirituality with a visibly good appetite.
More than once she expressed her rapture; that it was only I who could give such good food to her, while I showed my gratitude with a smile, knowing that my food was the remains of the regular daily Hin lunch.
Once the woman swallowed painfully then, opening her mouth wide, rose and approached me as if she wanted to bite my nose.
The strange move somewhat surprised me and I drew back frightened and she sat back in her place with an expression no less surprised.
"Don't you want to look into my throat?"
"Into your throat?
Why should I look into your throat?"
She shook her head.
"You are a strange man.
Others would stipulate in advance that I should open my mouth wide after every bite."
I remarked that I abandoned any such demands in advance, as according to me eating is for satisfaction. She, for her part, went on taking nourishment and related that on one occasion she had eaten a whole goose at some man's and, with a roguish smile, assured me that she could eat even more than this, and then requested me to turn to her at any other time should I want to feed a woman, and I should not believe other women as they would not be able by any means to eat as much of my food as she, nor with such a good appetite.
I gave her my word, at which she gave me her address and then proceeded to tell me about her former host, how in addition to having to open her mouth wide at his request, she had also to eat the goose with chocolate as well as having to show her teeth after every bite.
I was already beginning to suffer from rather dissonant feelings but the real surprise was still to come.
The woman went on and remarked that although she had had to eat a lot then, she also earned a lot.
He had been a very generous man.
With this she wiped her mouth and - asked for money.
This unexpected turn of event surprised me so much that I could only stammer a protest, saying she had eaten her fill of my spirituality so she had no right to ask for extra payment.
The woman suddenly became furious, flew into a rage, called me names, termed it the greatest villainy that when she had devoted her midface to me I was not even prepared to compensate her, although she had charged comparatively little for the eating.
I asserted in vain that she had no right to ask for extra payment for her own pleasure.
The more I tried to reason with common sense, the angrier she became.
"You worthless bivak!" she shouted.
"I come in to you, allow myself to be satisfied and at the end you would run away with the fee of it?
I'll give you something to think about!"
One word led to another but I trusted that she would not dare to spread the news of her having taken her fill with me.
Of course, I was again disappointed in my calculations.
The woman, with a dreadful howl, flung the door open and ran away.
And the next day I was summoned to the betik who let me know that again a complaint had been lodged against me: I had not paid a woman to whom I had given spirituality.
The accusation stunned me.
I did not even deny that I had given her spirituality; on the contrary, I referred to it myself saying that I did not owe her any extra payment.
At this the betik burst into a loud laugh.
I looked around idiotically. I had no idea why I should be laughed at and added that it had been the woman herself who had stated that she was hungry. So what right could she possibly have - when, taking pity on her ravenousness, I had appeased her appetite - to make, in addition to my kindheartedness, extra financial claims?
The betik laughed still more loudly, called me an amusing fool, and in no time everybody was doubled up with laughter.
This made me lose my temper completely and I remarked that the matter was much more deplorable than to be dismissed by laughing and stated that being aware of my rights, I was now setting up a counter- claim and demanded from the woman the price of the pleasure to which I was at least as much entitled as she.
The laughter that burst out at this almost brought down the walls.
It took many minutes for the betik to recover, and wiping away his tears he affirmed that it had been a very long time since he had had such a good laugh; but after all the matter was much more serious than any that could have been dropped simply by laughing at it, and after all, the law was the law. He was compelled to apply the laws as without them order and sane civilization would have been overturned.
Whether the Reader believes it or not, they imprisoned me again!
And I had a week to ponder about what harm I had actually done.
After my discharge I complained to Zemoeki of my adventure, but he, too, only laughed at it, especially at my having believed that the woman was hungry, although I could have known that it was not out of hunger that that sort asked for spirituality I asserted in vain that the woman herself asked for food and he simply replied that I should have known from that itself that she did not want to eat but to earn money, for a woman who was really hungry would not say so.
This was the last straw.
I could not endure this tight-rope any longer.
I never knew when the sword of Damocles permanently hanging above my head would drop onto me.
Oh, how many times I yearned: that my mind become deranged so that I would be similar to them and I would always know when white should be called black and when yellow!
But for anyone who with his sound mind clearly sees the white, this faculty of clear sight is so confusing that he can never find the suitable lie and fails. Once he violates the ketni, then he infringes the bikbam, or violates the child's bruhu.
How much better off the lunatics are, how happy are the Behins and also how happy are the subjects of the glorious British state that they can all live among their fellow-citizens, of sound mind, similar to themselves.
Before long, however, they informed me that because of my run of scandals I had lost my job.
That was all I needed!
I ran to and fro, asked Zemoeki to help me, but he, too, turned away from me as from some evildoer.
And after a few days I was thrown out of my cell and was left to go out into the world.
I went back to the betik and implored him that if they were to deprive me of spirituality then they should also kill me. Why, it was an incontestable reality that everybody had a midface to receive the spirituality, which I could not abandon together with my job, and I felt I would die.
The betik, however, comforted me saying that there was one truth only in the world, the kona that was aneba, but if I wished to regain my life, I had turned to the proper quarter; why it was his very purpose to afford nourishment to the needy and the errant.
With tears in my eyes I stammered a few words of gratitude and he asked me to pass him from the shelf the box inscribed with the bikru's name.
When I had given it to him, he took out a yellow pebble, which he knocked against the side of the box a few times then handed over to me to be squeezed under my arm.
I was astounded by this heartless cynicism which enabled him to play a practical joke on a fellow-man pleading for his life.
Regrettably my exposed situation prevented me from giving an appropriate reply.
Instead snatching my foot with one hand, and putting the other on my head, I had to implore him to give me spirituality as well as the anebas for nourishment that I could preserve my life.
The betik, however, far from getting friendlier, jumped up and shouted at me with flashing eyes that I should not dare to claim of the spirituality that it nourished, and I should especially not mention this ignominious word in the vicinity of the yellow pebble, because for such an outrage of the anebas he would be compelled to levy very harsh punishment.
As a feeble defence I tried to mention only that each of us had spirituality, even the elak betiks - in fact, they even more.
This was my ruin.
He assured me that the betiks - as was known to all - did not use spirituality and added that for this he would surely put me in my place.
With this he took me by the scruff of my neck and threw me out.
Trembling with impotent rage I sobbed for along time.
With my stomach rumbling hungrily I loitered aimlessly until I had to resort to the last means: I sat under a tree and begged.
I lived in this way for a week.
I also slept under this tree the whole night, cold, and wrapped in my tatters.
And the night became more and more chilly and I could not even clean myself properly.
I contracted lice and scab and nobody cared for me.
Eventually one day a saving idea occurred to me.
I remembered the woman on account of whom I had lost my job.
I decided to follow her example, in which way it would be easy to obtain food and money.
So I called aside the very first woman and confidently whispered to her that I was very hungry and willing to take some spirituality cheaply.
At this without any introduction she began shrieking frantically. Many people gathered around to whom, between fits of swooning, she related what had happened.
Terrible things followed with the description of which I do not wish to make excessive demands on the Reader's nerves.
To cut a long story short, within five minutes I 'was sprawling on the ground in blood.
It turned out that eating for money was valid only for women; men were excluded.
And the Reader is thoroughly wrong if he believes that I was knocked about by the female sex united in the defence of their interests.
On the contrary: it was the men who beat me most thoroughly and viciously. Precisely the man whose food was usually eaten by this woman. So, though a whole world separated me from this unfortunate race, I sincerely took pity on this miserable, deplorably stupid and deceived male sex, as they defended their own humiliation and exploitation.
And it was the man mentioned before who shouted after every blow that I had wanted him to be deceived.
My sufferings had not yet come to an end.
The next day an official came up to me and told me that Zukrula had laid a charge against me for having requested food of another woman, and I would probably be punished heavily.
Amazed, I asked him why. He replied that only Zukrula was entitled to do so for she had been hit on the head with the copper cube.
Thrilled with joy I told him that I would also accept food from Zukrula, I even suggested that four or five women should team up to feed me alternately by which the burden borne by each would be less.
He stated in consternation that that was impossible because it was Zukrula who had been hit on the head.
I suggested that the others should also be hit on the head at which he looked me up and down with utter contempt and said it seemed to him I had sunk to the very depths of squalor and I deserved to be burnt at the stake.
I spent the following days in the quiet lethargy of semi-madness and believed that matters could at least not become any worse.
Alas, in this, too, I was mistaken.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
We reach the saddest chapter of author's adventures - The Behins break into the fit of rage called buku - Author almost falls victim to it - Author publishes with reservation the part concerning the bikru
A few days later many people gathered round me, of which I was very glad because it meant alms.
One of them got up on a stool and addressed the others.
He said that the kona's aim was to live in peace and brotherhood with the kemons.
Peace, friendliness and the mutual security of the family hearth must be ensured and each should support the other in the work of building.
Hearing this, I began to tremble.
Although I did not know what it meant, it sounded ominously sane and peaceful.
In a few minutes a formidable procession approached.
A crowd of Behins came in rows of five and they walked in step which, considering the usual Behin disorder, was in itself surprising enough.
However, it was still more conspicuous that each was clutching a knife in his hand, with which at every second step he jabbed towards the earth and shouted:
"Zuk!...
Zuk!...
Zuk!...
Zuk!.."
Beside them walked a figure still more tattered than the betiks, clashing an enormous pair of scissors and shouting a few words at them from time to time that made them burst into frenzied applause, and shake their knives and howl:
"Huuh!...
Huuh!...
Huuh!..."
Another figure was rushing around the procession with a tin-box and breathlessly distributed yellow pebbles from it.
As they came nearer I was able to get a better look at the speaker.
He had an expressionless, empty face; almost without a forehead.
The tousled hair which tumbled down made him appear still more beastly.
The advanced Graves' disease and his bulging eyes caused fear enough even from a distance.
His jaws were deformed. That is, his lower set of teeth protruded so much that his mouth could not contain them and on account of this his words could hardly be understood, although I was aware that my life might depend on how much I could understand of the events.
When they eventually passed close by me I succeeded in making out what he was saying.
"Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday!...
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday!..."
I looked after him agape.
Was this what they were applauding?
Was this what made them wild?
Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.
I turned.
Two Behins stood in front of me with knives.
One of them began to speak.
"What are you doing here?"
"I'm begging," I replied.
"But tell me, who is that therewith the scissors?"
"He is the knife-betik.
Don't you see that he has a double knife?"
"What is a knife-betik?"
"He is the cleverest betik."
"The cleverest?
How?"
"Because he bestows on us the salvation of the knife."
"If he is the cleverest, why doesn't he say Wednesday-Thursday?"
"Anybody could say that.
He knows how we must win the salvation of the knife, and he is always right.
Moreover there is a buku now and this requires emergency measures.
But let's come to the point: do you have a body licence?"
"Wha-at?"
"In a word, you haven't.
Then you are permitted to participate in the peace-work."
"How?"
"Take this," and he poked a knife into my hand, "and come with us to the hillside where you will ensure peace and civilization."
"How?"
"By stabbing the kemons and they you."
It was only then that the utter horror of the situation unfolded before me.
These unfortunate ones now were indeed on their way to kill.
The fit of rage called buku, of which I had heard so many times but had always hoped to be untrue, lo and behold, had come upon them.
I hurriedly stated that for the time being I did not wish to make use of the permission, but he yelled at me:
"I've told you that you are permitted to participate in the buku! "
With this he kicked me and pushed me into the ranks.
I tried to protest, but in no time knives threatened me from every side and the words stuck in my throat.
So what I would never have believed of myself had come to pass.
I had to join in and march, unprotestingly, together with these raging wretches, towards an unknown bloodbath.
Moreover, for the nightmare to be complete, I had to jab with my knife towards the earth at every second step and shout, "Zuk!...
Zuk!...
Zuk!..."
And whenever the bird-headed terror beside the troop screeched 'Thursday-Wednesday' in our direction I had to howl in chorus with the rest, "Huuh!...
Huuh!...
Huuh!..."
I write this down in the deepest shame.
I would never have believed that I, an officer of the British Navy, could be compelled to sink so low by lunatics.
But humiliation did not end with this.
It happened that the terror stepped up to me once and flashing his protruding eyes at me, ordered that I should command the howling.
When he had shouted 'Wednesday', I had to beckon with my knife, whereupon the mass broke into the 'Huuh'.
So it was not enough that II had to go mad; with them, I was also compelled to coerce others, too, for otherwise they would have stabbed me to death.
I blushed with shame and decided that if I was ever able to return to my country I would immediately resign my commission.
I felt that a coward who, having been scared by the threats of a bird-headed abortion, could become a party to the most evil-minded madness and meanest crime in the world could no longer pollute the Navy with his presence.
The only reason which prevented me was, as the Reader will presently see, that I recovered before long.
After a few minutes of marching, the hill came into view, and the blood froze in my veins at the horror which unfolded before my eyes.
On the hilltop konas and kemons brandished their knives and rushed at each other foaming at the mouth and within an instant my ears were split by the bestial howl of the demented inhabitants of the whole bedlam.
The inmates had broken loose; they kicked, tore, stabbed and cut each other up, and there was nobody to restrain them!
That was the last straw. As if I hadn't had enough trouble.
The Reader can imagine how I felt. I was going to be compelled to die miserably for some completely and absolutely senseless monomanias.
The monstrosities suddenly brought me back to myself.
I tried to explain what a horrible thing they were doing, but they turned to me in surprise.
"Would you really want to remain alive when you could die in buku by knife?
Would you miss the chance of the salvation of the knife, the greatest possible prize for which it was worth being born?
It seems you have no feeling for the boeto!"
They had rushed me into many things, but into this horror no kind of power could have forced me.
I stated that I had no intention of perishing aimlessly and senselessly.
"Bivak!" they bellowed.
"Do you think that the boeto is aimless?
Curb your tongue, for you will regret it bitterly if you abuse the kona!"
The knives again flashed towards me and in terror I asked them rather to let me beg, I had no wish to debase the kona's salvation, I wished the best of everything, only they should absolve me from the boeto. Why, I was not bad, I wished nobody any trouble, I wanted only to live in peace, happiness and tranquillity, and I wished the same for every kona.
The reply I received was a frightful storm of abuse, and ample blows.
They termed me an incendiary, a madman, a Hin, a red-handed executioner of mankind, boeto, the bikru and civilization, who had no feeling for the glorious anebas.
Most of all, however, they were abominably affronted that I had wished peace, happiness and tranquillity to every kona.
"To the stake with the lamik!" they shouted.
"That's all we need - that he should poison the healthy society with his base machinations and overthrow order!"
Another said that I should go to the kemons with my subversive work to overthrow order and peace there, not here where everybody wanted peace and justice.
I volunteered with pleasure to go and tell the same to the kemons, but they guffawed and said that then I would be beaten to death by them, but it was impossible to do so anyway as there was buku, and now both my spirit and body were at the disposal of their possessor, the kona.
When I replied that the possessor of the body was the individual himself, they upbraided me fiercely for professing such false doctrines, for it was known that I possessed only the clothes on my body.
If somebody else dared to take off my clothes he would be punished, but my body was not mine any more, because body and spirit were not for the individual himself but were lent by the bikru and the kona that I should have something to clothe in the garment constituting myself.
By that time everybody was shouting lamik around me and they demanded that, as the enemy of public peace and civilization, I should be taken to the betik.
I understood that every word here was a waste of breath.
It would be best if they exterminated each other and only I should get away alive.
I stated that I did not want to, disturb them in their civilization and in the buku, I even sincerely wished success to both parties (and it was not a lie, indeed) only that they leave me, wretched bivak, in my shame.
But they had already taken hold of me, and they dragged me to the betik.
Ample blows showered on my back, insults were heaped upon me, but while this was happening, becoming strong in my soul, I completely changed.
Self-confidence coursed through me as - having managed; at last to recover from cowardly submissiveness and, in the manner of a hero, facing even a martyr's death - I was able to stand up against crack-brained sin and baseness.
I was imbued with the proud knowledge that I conducted myself at the end., as befitted to an officer of the glorious British Navy.
They took me to the very same betik with whom I had served and who had thrown me out recently.
He of course soon established that I was a lamik and sentenced me to be burned alive.
In the reasons offered the epithets "extremist", "disturber of the peace" as well as the "moderate" and "charitable" occurred frequently.
The Reader, of course, believes that those were called moderate and charitable who wanted tranquillity and peace, and extremists and disturbers of the peace those on, the hill who were putting out each other's eyes and danced on the steaming bowels of their fellow-men.
No!
They meant it the other way round!
Now they assigned a beratnu to me who, although he did not hurt me, commenced an endless jabber about all kinds of obscure things which I naturally did not understand. There was no rhyme or reason to it.
I noted only that he frequently mentioned the bikru which, naturally, now accounted for everything.
Not the guard, but the bikru's hand had dragged me along to the betik, the bikru had punished me, the bikru was preparing the fire for the stake in the yard, and so on.
As it was all the same to me anyway, I dared to defy being laughed at and asked him point-blank what the bikru was.
"The bikru is the most betik betik," he replied.
"So he is a man?"
"He is no longer alive, but he lived once."
"And why do you call him the most betik betik?"
"Because of his infinitely wise tenets."
I trembled at the very word.
What sort of madness was it that they called wisdom?
All the same I asked out of curiosity, "What did he teach?"
"That to be stabbed with a knife is not pleasure but pain; that we are born for life and not for death, therefore we must not stab.
He declared that there is no betik but we all are men alike; that it is not the yellow pebble that nourishes but the spirituality, which the bikru called food, and that anyone who takes it away from others wears the bilevs in vain, for he is in reality a hypocrite and pickpocket.
He said that we should live in peace, happiness and mutual understanding."
The Reader, of course, is, by now, rubbing his eyes and does not want to believe it.
Just imagine how I received these words!
I could not believe my ears.
"What did you say?" I asked dumbfounded.
But the beratnu said exactly the same the second time.
"Then he was a lamik!" I exclaimed in surprise.
"How can you make such an ignominious statement concerning the most betik betik?!" he cried out in consternation.
"So, indeed, such a man lived, and you did not burn him at the stake?"
Well... as a matter of fact, we did, because people of those days did not understand him. But since his glorious martyrdom we still accept his tenets, and from that time on we all live in his spirit."
"That's why you squeeze the yellow pebble under your arm?!
That's why you take away the food from the starving, that's why you stab the kemons?" I asked indignantly.
"All this we do to his glory and in his defence."
"Why?
Is the kemon perhaps the enemy of the bikru?
Don't you think that all this would even then be an ignominious mockery of the thesis that you must not stab?"
"The kemons are not enemies of the bikru.
They worship him just like us."
Breath failed me.
I thought I was dreaming.
I had to, pinch myself to make sure.
"But tell me, then, unfortunate one," I exclaimed trembling, "why do you do all these horrors?"
"In defence of the bikru. To enforce his doctrines."
"And the kemons?"
"They want the same."
(I remark in brackets that I impart this to the Reader only with reserve because I admit this part is doubted not only by him but even by myself.
Although my travel notes bear out the above and I, too, clearly remember the words, this supersedes any mental defect to such an extent that I cannot imagines even lunatics to be capable of all this with unruffled conscience, and would rather take it to be the creation of my overstressed brain deranged by my sufferings of that time and, the surrounding insanity.
That I still publish it is purely for the sake of completeness, and, even if the part about the bikru, was hallucination, it may serve as material for any neuropathologists when they are studying states of agitation similar to mine at that time.)
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Author is taken to the stake but in a near miraculous manner he escapes - He fulfils an important but sad mission which entails the tragic perdition of the Behins
The guards came for me, handcuffed me, and we started into the open.
In front of me walked the beratnu holding the square high.
From the hillside ferocious shouting and gruesome death-rattles could be heard.
They led me to where the fire had been prepared, bound my feet together and threw me on top of it while the crowd frantically inveighed against me.
One shouted that I had incited against the throwing out of food which would have meant them starving to death, another that I had protested against the removal of my spirituality by which I had robbed others; that I had stubbornly insisted on wearing my old shabby clothes by which I had made a public scandal; I had made mockery of the kipu, denied the joy of the thorns, and with the fanciful ideas of the most exaggerated false doctrines had poisoned decent public life, I had wanted to plunge the blessing of civilization into blood, flame and filth.
Like one enormous buzzing beehive they whirled around me howling:
"You incited against common sense!"
"You claimed the circle was round!"
"You referred to your eyes in opposition to anebas!"
"You slandered the spirituality-giving betik!"
"You wanted to feed on spirituality!"
"You upset public peace!
You stirred up strife with false doctrines!"
"You denied the bikru's tenets!"
"You fed a woman!"
"You didn't feed a woman!"
And as for me, shutting my eyes, I acquiesced in everything and peacefully expected charitable death which would at last relieve me from the tortures of the raving.
I gave a sigh of relief when they finally lighted the firebrand and took my leave smiling at the crazy herd stamping their feet with rage whose howl melted into one horrible cacophony with the cries of death from the hillside.
And then a strange thing ensued.
Several cars drove in through the gate containing Hins, with gas-masks on.
The Hins kept their hands on the jet nozzles mounted on the cars.
White smoke puffed from the nozzles.
They drove straight towards the hill.
I began shouting at the top of my voice.
The bystanders immediately covered my mouth and grabbed me by the throat but, fortunately, they were too late.
One of the cars turned out of the line and moved at full speed straight towards me.
At, the appearance of the Hins the situation immediately changed.
Everybody present, including the betik, snatched their right foot into their hand, and they outvied each other in shouting, "Vake!
Vake!"
They respected the Hins very much even though they loathed them which, however, does not appear to be paradoxical for one who knows their mad ways; for it was not knowledge and good heart that impressed them as is usual among educated Europeans but roughness and crass brute force.
And, after all, the Hins kept them in their power.
The Hins got out of the car, unbound my ropes,. helped me into the car and handing me a gas-mask rushed on.
All this took place in almost no time.
I could hardly recover for sheer joy.
My happiness was even more enhanced by the fact that I discovered Zatamon among those sitting in the car.
I could not control myself any more.
Weeping for joy I grasped the liberating hand; I did not even care that my gratitude made no visible impression on him.
With tears in my eyes I told him of my sufferings and entreated them to take me out with them for I had not only failed to feel myself a Behin but all my limbs were still trembling on account of the monstrosities I had been exposed to in that upset and deranged world.
Zatamon did not react with more than that this was the nonexisting life, the kazi which I had now had the chance to experience.
Although I did not fully understand what he meant by that, I could state with a clear conscience that I had never before realized so profoundly the wise and patient majesty of the kazo after the time spent among these raving madmen.
By this time our car had reached the hill and cut straight through the ranting masses.
The massacre had just reached its peak.
Blood flowed like water.
Here and there was a square or a circle fastened to a rod.
The knives flashed, in the throats howled brute fury, or the blood of the cut open throttle gurgled.
The whole runaway bedlam bellowed, whirled and killed.
Horror came over me at the thought that I, too, had two hands and two feet like them.
Now we all put on our gas-masks.
The Hins rushed among them with strong gas jets. The gas was ejected from the nozzles whistling under the enormous pressure.
In the meantime some of the cars had surrounded them so that nobody could escape.
The raving lunatics lost their consciousness at the first breath, and one after the other dropped to the ground, but even while they fell they held on tightly to their knives, their eyes flashed, and even in the last wild rattling, words were formed by the grinding teeth: "Bikru!
Sanity!
Aneba!
Buku!"
When the last one had fallen asleep, the Hins got out, collected then, and put a strait-jacket on each.
It was then that I saw the Hins shudder with horror for the first time: when they got out onto the ground they had to step into pools of human blood.
Now consultation began.
They all agreed that there was no point in experimenting with these any more and it was desirable to bring all the fighting Behins to an end.
It was I who interfered, explaining to Zatamon that probably not all of them had killed of their own accord.
I referred to my own case and suggested that the incurable ones should be separated from those who were not beyond cure.
The Hins seeing that I spoke sensibly in spite of my being a suspect of Behinity, accepted my opinion. They, even asked me what method I held most suitable for selecting: the less sick ones.
I recommended an election.
The whole Behin settlement should vote to show who was in favour of the buku.
I had to explain the essence of the election in detail as they did not know and could not even imagine that there could be any question concerning life relating to which people had different opinions, as the fullness of life could be lived in one manner only.
They were only aware of scientific differences of opinion where, if the litmus turned blue, the contrary opinion of a hundred scientists was disproved.
The Hins accepted my suggestion and agreed that with regard to my experience among the Behins and my sufficiently sound approach, they would commission me to arrange the ballot and, so that nothing should take place in an unnatural way if possible, the extermination of the hopeless ones, too, would be entrusted to themselves. Those in favour of fighting would be led to a closed field and there they would be provided with knives so that they themselves could exterminate each other.
The Reader can imagine my pleasure at such a pleasant change at last occurring in my sad life.
The sleeping Behins were then collected and transported to a big, closed room, where they were strictly observed and they could return to their cells only the next day.
And I was removed from among them, and I could once more take my place in the Belohin institute, where at last I was given clean clothes, I had a proper bath and shaved myself, the electric hat cut my hair, I was deloused, with electric machines they massaged my contorted and crippled limbs, on which the red traces of the rope still showed, and at night I retired to a soft bed, satisfied, clean, in a silent electrically heated room.
Nobody disturbed me and nothing threatened me, the morrow was clean and sure.
I felt it was the ultimate in pleasure when I stretched myself out with nothing to worry about.
I wanted to merit the Hins' appreciation as much as possible; thus I organized the election with great zeal.
The next day I went in with ten Hins and two gas cars to the Behins.
Our appearance elicited great respect. All the betiks turned out to meet us, they united and took- their copper cubes off their knees and holding them in their palms repeatedly offered them to us, which the Hins of course did not understand, but I saw that it was meant to be some honour or sign of submission.
For me it was a great satisfaction to see the betik who had sentenced me offer me his clumsy rubbish with frightened humility, mentioning among much murmuring bruhu, aneba, ketni, kona, and other idiotic nonsense.
When he wanted to slip a yellow pebble into my hand I strongly felt like taking him by the scruff of the neck and stuffing their "nourishment" down his throat, but I was afraid that the Hins would form an unfavourable opinion of me and my kazo turn of mind.
So I issued the order that all the Behins should gather together, at which those present ran away in all directions and in ten minutes everybody stood around us, konas and kemons separately of course eyeing each other with ferocious hatred.
And I announced to both parties that the next day there, would be a vote about the buku, and they would be given a free hand in their internal affairs.
After this we left.
The next day ballot was, indeed, carried out, separately on kona and kemon territories lest they should start a fight.
However, the result was a surprise to all of us because., almost without exception, they clamoured for the buku.
This particularly touched me on a raw spot as the Hins might draw the conclusion that the vote appeared to have been superfluous.
I tried to talk to the Behins one by one, in private.
When I asked why they wanted to rip open the bodies of their fellowmen, they all replied that such an intention was far from them, they only wanted to see the boeto ensured through the buku.
And I told them in, vain that the boeto was but a word, and the essence of the thing was after all only pain, suffering and death. They replied that it was just the opposite.
"Suffering", they said, "is but an episode, only on the surface, while the boeto is the sense, essence and inner content of things. He who doesn't feel it is colour-blind, someone who sees only the surface and has no sense of the essence that signifies the content of life."
They asserted without hesitation that the essence maintained life, for which - it was even worth dying!
When I called their attention to the inherent contradiction they replied that the life of the community required that individuals should die for it.
They were convinced that the community could live only if individually all were to die.
Between the pronounced word and the mind there was no connection at all.
Therefore I argued no further but announced that whoever had voted for the fight, would be allowed to fight to their heart's content the next day in the free buku.
They would be led to the hillside, provided with arms and allowed to fight against each other, while those who had no wish to fight could remain at home.
Fortunately I had thus far had sufficient opportunity to experience their inconsistencies, otherwise I would have been very surprised at the murmur of discontent that received my words.
Regrettably, however, much as I was accustomed to their inconsistencies, I could not get away from my sound logic sufficiently not to think about it at all.
So even now I looked for an explanation and thought that cowardice induced them to balk when it came to putting their enthusiasm into practice.
Now I was already very ashamed of myself before the Hins' and was anxious about my position because of this run of failures.
After a slight hesitation I even mentioned my uncertainty to the leader of the Hins accompanying me, lest another failure should make them believe I had not reckoned with anything.
I was all the more pleasantly surprised when he replied that it seemed I had made their acquaintance in vain, for my brain was too kazo to understand them, or more exactly, to get accustomed to them, because, naturally nothing could be understood the essence of which was senselessness.
What the Behins talked about that night, I do not know.
Perhaps nothing; and the surprises that came the next day are also to be attributed to their peculiar madness, a special characteristic of which was that though there was no consistency, in them, in a wondrous way, each was inconsistent in the same manner.
So, the next day we drove those who wanted to fight to the hillside.
They, of course, closed up their ranks in two stiffly separated groups and turned their back on each other.
It was characteristic of the Hins' naivety that when they saw this they suggested that we should perhaps take the groups one by one and distribute the knives first to one group and let those of the other group fall upon each other only when the first group had exterminated each other.
Stifling my smile I had to explain to them that neither group would fight within itself, as for each the presence of the other was necessary.
This they did not understand, of course, and asked why it was not simpler for them to stab at those nearest to them, as they were going to stab each other anyway.
I answered with the airiness of a very experienced man.
"The one group is kona, the other is kemon.
They fight only if they come together."
It was only when the Hins looked at each other that I realized what a "senseless explanation" I had given, though after some thought, I myself admitted that it was indeed incomprehensible why it was not possible to commence the massacre on themselves.
Thus I remarked that Behin things I could explain only in Behin, so they should not expect more of me.
Our cars confined the Behins within a large circle.
We handed out the knives to them and finally I announced that the buku was open.
And then I saw in astonishment that the Behins did not budge.
Our cars were standing all around, we were all provided with gas-masks, holding the jet-nozzles ready; and inside the two groups of adversaries, some twelve hundred men stood motionless.
One minute, two minutes, ten minutes passed.
The Hins looked at me questioningly and I was in the greatest perplexity.
However before long a man on the kona side climbed onto a tree-stump and delivered a speech to the others.
"You may perhaps believe," he said, "that the Hins are now supporting us in achieving the boeto and now we have the opportunity to wage buku for boeto life and peace."
"You are wrong.
In our ketni deeds, the Hins do not see the profound essence of life, but take them for senseless fights.
But how could this bivak crowd ever perceive what can only be breathed in by living and warm lungs in which sacred respect for the anebas and the boeto is alive, while empty and cold lungs remain far from it and- lose their direction in the emptiness of the desert.
Respect for the anebas and the bikru is the unshakable point that gives content and aim to our life, which distinguishes the Behin from the brute Hin; this is what steels our arms in the noble buku, this is what makes the sons of the behas bumbuk, happy to sacrifice their lives for the boeto and the salvation of the knife."
Bumbuk means murderer, but I must point out to the Reader that they had more than one expression for this, depending on whom the murderer killed, because in their soft-headed opinion they did not despise all murderers equally, and the bumbuks were even esteemed.
As to the meaning of this word, however, opinions differed, and I could by no means understand it all.
For according to the konas, bumbuk was one who had killed a kemon, and according to the kemons, one who had killed a kona.
Then he continued.
"Respect for the salvation of the knife and the anebas is the source of life of the behas, without this our fate would be death and ruin.
(Thus they seriously believed that they would have died if they had not massacred each other!)
Let us therefore foster in our lungs higher ideals, and steadfast devotion to the bikru and the anebas.
A true Behin lives or dies with his knife and boeto."
After this came much senseless jabber, but I have no wish to impart it to the Reader, particularly because I could not even remember so much nonsense.
I could at least make out that treachery had taken place.
He claimed that we had held the salvation of the knife up to ridicule, and that by our procedure we made the noble buku appear as if it were a common and aimless coming to blows, and now, as in an arena, to public ridicule, we pitted the bumbuks against each other like cocks.
The defence of the boeto was not a puppet show but the salvation of the knife.
"Behins!" he shouted.
"Don't you see that their aim is not that we should have a share in the salvation of the knife, but that we should destroy each other?!"
(I give up!
Is the salvation of the knife not the destruction of each other?)
"Because," he said, "while we bumbuks would stupidly have killed each other off this could only be utilized bye the lamiks who in a treacherous and perfidious way shirk their duties towards the anebas who await only that the cream and pride of both behas, the noble bumbuks, should perish to the last one, so that then the well-poisoners of the kona and the kemons should be able to unite the two behas.
And do you know what will happen if the two behas unite?
The beha itself will cease!
All the anebas circle, square will cease, and every feat that distinguishes man from the beast of prey will be trampled into the mud!"
Angry outcries were to be heard.
"We won't allow the anebas to be destroyed!"
"Not this or that aneba is concerned here," the speaker went on, "but the very existence of the anebas and the order without which the noble bumbuks would have nothing to live and die for and the salvation of the knife, which a ketni man has to defend from bloody destruction by some furious lunatics. For what would it be worth if we lived and there were no anebas?
We must now unite against the common enemy, and not slaughter each other as it would not be buku but hideous butchery.
So let's make peace, go home and put to the knife those lamik traitors who, wanting to evade the bliss of boeto while looking on from safety, might watch the noble bumbuks bleeding like miserable puppets for public ridicule, so that afterwards the lamiks' ignominious machinations might destroy the behas defended and preserved for us in hundreds of bloody bukus by our ancestors."
The speech was received with frenzied applause, the two camps mixed in no time and among ardent scratchings of each other's posteriors they vowed friendship to each other against the lamiks, for what point would there have been in dying if it was not prohibited.
The two mortal enemies ceased to be enemies at the very moment when they were threatened by the danger that in the future they would indeed not be enemies, and they immediately made peace lest someone should create a real peace.
The Behins' peace may serve the fight only.
Put down in this way, it sounds so tortuous that I do not even try to explain it.
Even while describing it I feel that should I have to go on analysing it, I myself would become completely confused.
The Hins, of course, did not understand a word of all this, except that the Behins did not want this either. But what did they actually want?
I myself did not understand them either, but had forebodings of danger and I recommended the Hins to put on their gas-masks.
No sooner had this been done than a delegation came to us requesting that we should let them go home as they did not want the buku.
The Hins listened to them in bewilderment, but I hastened to enlighten them on the Behins' intention and advised them to put an end to the whole company as things were hopeless.
They received my words with some aversion.
Naturally, from the naive Hin point of view it was difficult to understand why it meant still greater danger if somebody did not want to fight.
A lengthy conference ensued.
It was so strange to see the Hins hesitating. They who were so miraculously balanced and decisive in the matters of their own life.
In the end they decided that everybody could go home but the knives had to be laid down.
This decision was received with an infernal howl.
From the surging one of the loudest suddenly emerged and jumping towards my car shouted foaming with rage:
"Here is the traitor!
He has brought ruin upon us!"
And he spat at me not caring that my hand rested on the push-button of the jet nozzle with which I could disable him in an instant.
However, as I was afraid that the Hins might not understand I did not dare to use the hose.
An infernal howl accompanied the words.
Fists rose against me.
Finally one of them yelled:
"Why are you hesitating?
Are you afraid of a lamik?
To leave a lamik alive is tantamount to breaking our knives with our own hands!"
A murmur of horror was the reply.
A torrent of abuse was hurled at me.
"It is you who outraged the boeto!"
"It is you who undermined the ketni!"
"You have spoiled the child's bruhu!"
"It is you who defiled the bikbam!"
"You have destroyed the peace!"
And the leader, taking advantage of the general feeling and outshouting everybody else, bellowed:
"He is the one who used the knife for the most ignominious purpose!"
The crowd flared up - a mass of foaming consternation was the response.
One even pronounced it: "For eating!"
The lunatics burst into an ear-splitting roar.
The speaker hoarsely tried to outbellow the crowd.
"That's it!
Do you know what this lamik does with the knife?
He eats!
Eats!
He outrages civilization!
Why are you hesitating?
This will be the real buku!
After me!
Vake!"
With that he rushed towards me, leapt on to the running board, the knife flashed but I managed to push the button of the jet nozzle a fraction of a second earlier.
A burst of gas roared out.
It swept the Behin off the running board like a ball.
He fell prostrate in a faint.
The others, utterly infuriated by the sight, yelled even more noisily.
"Vake!
Vake!"
Many of them leapt towards me at the same time, I could hardly defend myself with the jet-nozzle.
Before long eight of them lay near my car.
The crowd fell silent for a moment.
And now a strange thing ensued.
In the middle, a betik held up a square fastened on a pole in one hand and a circle in the other.
And the crowd, snatching their right foot in their hand burst into an unearthly howl.
"Vake!
Vake!"
Tears shone in their eyes, and then, as if at a given signal, they all began to sing.
I could not help it. The atmosphere, in spite of all its oddity, was so touching that it carried even me away, though I knew that all this was directed against me.
I feared that their behaviour - stupid though it was and yet elevating - would win the Hins over.
I admit, I was anxious both for my position and my life.
The song came to an end. Now one of them shouted out:
"After me!
Even if all of us should die, the behas and the boeto will live!"
And waving his knife at me he started forward.
The crowd as one man flashed their knives high and followed him.
I was thoroughly bewildered. What should I do if I lost the sympathy of the Hins?
The weapons were unequal to such an extent that not only was I myself ashamed of the mass destruction, but being aware of the Hins' humane turn of mind, I knew that they would prevent me from carrying it out, and then I would be lost.
And on the lips of the crowd the song resounded again and, with circles and squares held high, they walked towards me like the first Christians might have walked to meet the swords of the gladiators.
I would never have believed that lunatics could be so enthusiastic about aimless and senseless obsessions.
They were no more than a few steps from me and in a fit of despair I squirted out the gas at them hoping to put them to flight.
But as soon as the first few had fallen, the others, following the rhythm of the song, steadfastly continued.
More and more Behins fell and the crowd came in serried lines towards, me jumping over the unconscious ones.
Suddenly, to my great surprise the Hins' cars moved into action; gas spouted from every jet-nozzle.
All this happened simultaneously, without a single word of command.
The mass took fright and retreated, but the Hins gave no quarter.
They advanced. The surrounding circle tightened; the white cloud whirled and rolled along. The Behins tried to escape, but the Hins cut off their line of retreat with jets of gas.
They gathered again in the middle, and the song resounded anew.
However, the Hins were now in no mood for mercy.
It wrung my heart to see how they sprayed the gas cold-bloodedly into the crowd, who were now giving up the struggle.
The Behins collapsed one after the other, the song became fainter and fainter. Suddenly the circle and the square held near each other also wavered.
The one who had held them collapsed but immediately they were snatched from his hands by others who held them high until they, too, fell.
They passed from one pair of hands to the next, until the last one stuck them into the ground and finally, he, too, broke off in midvoice.
Silence conquered the square and my eyes bulged with tears.
But it was only now that the real horror came.
The Hins changed the gas, put a different mask on me, and then flooded the crowd with the new gas.
I noticed in alarm that the chest of the people lying on the ground ceased to rise and fall.
I wanted to cry, but the mask prevented me.
Five minutes later they again changed the gas; this they squirted about at random, then everybody took off their masks.
This last was probably a neutralizing gas.
The cloud was so thick that to begin with I could not see anything.
It took some minutes before it became somewhat clearer.
A heart-breaking sight unfolded before my eyes: on the two poles stuck into the ground the circle and the square shone, around them one thousand two hundred corpses covered the ground.
After the howling rage of madness, an oppressive silence weighed heavy on the field.
The Hins untied and removed their masks, and took down the jet nozzles without a word.
The gloomy silence of death lay heavily on my chest.
Or was it perhaps that of the Hin life?
As soon as I could speak, I asked Zatamon what had been done.
With his usual dry composure he replied that they had annihilated the Behins.
To my question as to who had ordered them to do so, he answered in surprise that no orders had been necessary here.
Any man in his right senses could have seen that they had to be exterminated.
Then he explained that whoever ran into death while he was in full health was a hopeless raving lunatic and entirely worthless to society.
I can assure the Reader that I felt very grieved about this rigid way of thinking but I could not do anything.
After this I withdrew to my room and buried myself in my thoughts.
I thought for a long time about the unfortunate Behins, and finally came to the conclusion that whatever terrible things they had perpetrated, they had been unaware not only of the horror of their deeds, which would be unbecoming even to madmen, but also of whether they had indeed done this or that.
Poor Behins, they had run and run, chasing after castles in the air which they were not only unable to reach (as it is impossible), but they did not want them either, because as soon as they found the path to one thing, they immediately wanted something else.
The Behins' life is absurdity itself, impossible to put into practice.
Something may have been gnawing at their nerves making the living of life impossible for them.
Their life was without meaning, just like their words and struggles.
Indeed, it was better this way, and only this way did it make sense.
But alas!
And now my heart sank because poor Zemoeki and Zeremble occurred to me.
Perhaps they, too, were lying now among the many Behin corpses.
Two poor fanciful fellows, at whose follies I had sometimes laughed and sometimes become annoyed, and whom I had perhaps lost for ever.
It would have been difficult though to account for what I had lost in them, but after all, they had nonetheless been my friends and a feeling heart could not so easily forget such ties.
I went to bed that evening with a heavy heart and decided that I would not brood over things but relax thoroughly during the days to come.
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
In this chapter light will finally be cast on, he secrets of the Hins' strange life - The Behinity and the kazo - Author and his country are deeply offended by Zatamon, leading him to a decision
In the morning I lay down in the place for sun-bathing on the top of the hospital and the infinite happiness of relaxation descended on my nerves.
I was contemplating the mountain opposite me in a sleepy-happy mood, the side of which was divided into two by a long silvery spiral.
It rotated now upwards, now downwards.
I had no idea of its function.
It was one of their strange machines, of which I had seen hundreds during my stay, but had I lived for twenty years among them this would still have been too short a time to come to know all of them.
However, the machine itself was of no interest at the moment, it only gave a pleasant, soothing feeling to see this mystic perpetuum mobile.
My state of excitement gradually abated.
I had been enjoying the sweet freedom from care for many hours, when I felt a hand on my shoulder.
Looking up I saw Zatamon.
He brought up a chair and sat down by my side.
"Tell me," he said, "the impressions left in you from your life among the Behins."
To my question why that was necessary, he replied that it was necessary for the proper diagnosis of my present state.
I tried again to sketch my sufferings in a few words, but the wounds of my soul were still so deep that even the mere memory sickened me.
Trembling overcame me, my, voice faltered and I had to ask him to dispense, for the time being, with recalling the events.
"I am a British citizen," I said. "I was brought up to respect sanity and civilization, in a place where yes means agreement and no means denial.
Mental disorder I only cured, and you may figure what it meant for me to be exposed to such a degree of insanity that it is impossible to picture it."
I expressed my sincere regret that this most terrible disease of the world had struck precisely their flourishing and peaceful island and suggested that he might describe the disease in more detail, since it was of extraordinary interest to me as a physician.
Although he had said something about the cosmic rays of the sun before my being locked up, to my regret, owing to my then erroneous beliefs (of which I was by this time much ashamed) I had not paid due attention to it.
I truly ate humble pie and it gave satisfaction to me to do penance for my sin.
Among the wise Hins I actually felt like a child, who had fled back to his mother's arms from, the bullying of bad boys.
"I have already mentioned," Zatamon commenced, "that the functions of life are influenced by the cosmic rays of the sun.
That is the source of all life. The will to live also comes from the sun, together with warmth in the form of cosmic rays.
This radiation is received by the brain as an aerial, and its operation goes on in a manner determined by the rays.
This is what forms instinct."
"That is, the rays have an effect on the instinct similar to that which the hormones have on the functioning of the organs?"
"Yes.
Even you partly know the effect of the sun's cosmic rays on life.
You have experienced the coincidence of protuberances and sunspots with certain symptoms in life.
You have been surprised at the close correlation you yourself have observed between solar activity and certain diseases and even the frequency of accidents.
From such oscillations of the life force, you can see that it was dictated to the full by the cosmic rays of the sun to the nervous system.
The life force and instinct come from the sun.
And as long as instinct remains instinct without thinking, there is no trouble.
Have you seen the kazo life of the ants?..."
"What?!" I, interrupted him in surprise, as he had already used this comparison once.
"How does this witless animal come to the kazo which is the complicated rule of life for the intellectual beings of the Hin society?"
"Only that rule is complicated which is not life itself as, for example, the Behins' fantasies.
Life is simple and comes automatically.
It can be lived well in one way only and to live it wrongly is not only difficult, it is impossible.
In Nature there are no contradictions as contradictions themselves perish, as you saw with the Behins.
I'll give you an example: in the animal kingdom the long-lived and tough animals are the least prolific, while the short-lived and fragile species are prolific.
You, of course, respect in this the organizing force, the mystic miracles of Nature, while it is nothing other than the kazo simple mathematical truth, reality itself: fact which cannot be otherwise.
If the hare hadn't a high reproduction rate, there would be no hares in the world at all, as they would have died out.
Now you can imagine that man could not live either if a contradiction had arisen in his productive labour, let's suppose, in the erroneous idea that instead of food we have to feed on pebbles or knives.
You must admit that a man living like that would perish in the same way as a hare incapable of mating.
This is expressed by the more sane among you as natural selection."
"Well, is it not that?"
"It's much more simple.
It is a mathematical formula a-a=0.
That is: if I live but do not maintain my life I will perish.
This is simply existing reality, the kazo, which, therefore, requires no learning.
Knowledge and education are necessary only to be a Behin; the kazo is so.
By itself."
I felt somewhat hurt for his talking to me as if I were unaware of even the elements of arithmetic, and incidentally I mentioned that I was perfectly familiar with the laws of mathematics.
"Let's not say 'law', he replied, because that already represents some intellectual creation whereas the kazo need not be understood, for our life cannot even be imagined in any other way."
"So, accordingly," I said, "Behinity is the lack of capacity for the elements of arithmetic, whereby one is unable to perform even the simplest operation in subtraction."
"By and large it is so, but not because of an inability to count but because the patient is unaware of the meaning of the numbers.
The Behin imagines that non-eating is actually eating and the knife does not end but promotes life."
"And how do such terrible misbeliefs get into his brain?"
"From the brain itself.
The human brain is a more complicated receiver than the ant's nervous system and as such it also emits self-oscillation which mixes with the cosmic rays of the sun.
And the brain receives this mixed wave, by which its comprehension of things becomes distorted, and its functions of life diverge from the kazo.
Besides the real aims the brain itself produces aims, false or perverted instincts, ketni, kipu, bruhu, bikbam, boeto and thousands of other non-existent things, by which their existence destroys itself and turns into non-existence."
"Because they don't understand mathematics..."
"I repeat, the kazo does not have to be understood for it is so by itself.
One plus one equals two, and the expression 1+1=3 is not only senseless, but doesn't even exist.
It's kazi.
The kazo is what exists and the kazi is what does not exist, and he who wants to live in a kazi manner is no longer alive."
"But the Behins were alive."
"But in an unharmonious way.
And disharmony inevitably liquidates itself.
The kazi cannot stop.
Neither the knife, nor the mufruks' breathing into the thin air, nor the yellow pebble will ever be nourishment.
All these are non-existent things, and the result, too, is non-existent life, death, as you have seen for yourself: for the boeto, square, ketni and anebas one has not to become satisfied and live, but to starve and die.
The whole of their past consisted in massacring each other.
But for the real aims one has to live: houses cannot be built and a cornfield cannot be reaped by a dead man."
I reflected on his words for a long time.
They had a familiar ring, as if I had heard them already sometime, somewhere, but now I did not ponder on that.
I was interested only in the essence.
"This is quite understandable so far," I said, "but you have mentioned that the human brain produces this confusing self-oscillation through its being complicated.
How is it possible then that it confuses the Behins' brain while yours is free of it?"
"Physiological research has borne out that the original inhabitants of our island were all Behins.
But things out of harmony with the kazo or, as you would say, with Nature, cannot survive for long - they perish and only what is harmonic remains.
This is how the only organism which has staying power has developed - the kazo.
You know that in the blood, phagocytes have developed which devour the bacilli and maintain the kazo balance - otherwise no man would have been able to live for a long time.
And what the attack of the bacilli was, was the self-oscillation when human thinking began.
Because of struggling for imaginary aims the ancient Hin or Behin was dying out until finally through a lucky permutation of the germ-plasm the new species, the Hin, came about, in which the antidote to self-oscillation already existed."
"And what is that?"
"Electric conducting layers took shape in the brain which shield the self-radiation which thus cannot get out and cannot interfere with the cosmic rays.
The beings that have been produced in this way are the H i n s.
Now you also understand why we consider the Behina completely different species."
"And how is it possible that Behins exist today?"
"Behinity is caused by a latent gene which sometimes occurs even in us, but of course we don't perceive it.
It may easily happen, however, that when two Hins carrying this latent gene mate the Behinity gene from both parents gets into the zygote.
In such cases the electric conducting layer is missing from the descendant's brain, that is a Behin offspring originates from Hin parents."
"In other words, the Behins' mental disorder is in point of fact a reversion to type?"
"Yes, that's it.
A reversion to the disharmony of primitive conditions.
Now you can understand why we separate, the Behins and why we exclude them from mating with us.
We hope that with this continuous straining off of the sick species, this harmful latent gene will disappear in a few centuries."
Now very many things dawned upon me all at once.
"So this is why the Behins are not human beings?" I asked.
"That's it, exactly.
The Behin is an ancient Hin.
An obsolete, superseded species.
Do you understand our kazo life now?
Do you see how perfectly united cooperation of the termites is possible between reasonable, thinking people, too?"
"So, you have returned to Nature?"
"We didn't return. One cannot step out of the kazo; one can only be annihilated.
We are the self-evident result of a logical procedure.
We have developed from the self-destroying Behin species as the only solution which has staying power."
I fell into deep thought.
Newton might well have felt so when the apple fell to the ground before him and revealed to him the general theory of gravitation keeping the whole universe in balance.
I felt how I was being transformed from one minute to the next.
Huge perspectives opened up before my mind, and worlds wheeled over on their poles.
Suddenly everything stood before me in another way, clearly.
Things had become simpler and taken shape.
The flame of the Burning Bush lit up a torch in me and suddenly there emerged before me the trunk of the Tree of Life, of which I had previously seen only the leaves, and only the greatest biologists had been able to grope back to the branches.
After lengthy pondering, one more question rushed to my lips.
"I am still surprised that it is not possible to make the Behins understand simple reality.
For their brain is otherwise quite well developed; they can count, I've even seen mathematicians of great merit among them, but in the simplest matters..."
"The Behin' s brain doesn't separate self-radiation from the cosmic rays and that the receiver distorts in a complicated manner only confirms the fact of distortion.
The more they know the more foolishly they will think; the hungrier they are the more food they will throw out; the less struggle required to produce our daily bread, the more they will kill each other for it; and when they writhe hungrily, sick and suffering they will hope to regain their strength through the "breath" of the mufruk, the kipu, the boeto, the yellow pebble or the salvation of the knife."
"There were also quite sensible Behins," I put in.
"I heard of some bikru..."
"Yes, there are ones whose intellect understands the necessity of the kazo but their being is still Behin and this renders their way of thinking imperfect and prevents them from achieving full perception."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Their obsessions are characteristic of the Behins.
The imagined misbeliefs."
"And what of the bikru?"
"Don't speak of 'the' bikru.
You shouldn't think that they had only one bikru.
There were several.
Perhaps, you, too, might have become one of them."
"Indeed?!" I looked at him flabbergasted.
"Yes.
They burn every bikru first.
Later they recognize him because, as you yourself have seen, they have minds but the self-radiation doesn't allow them to dominate clearly and as soon as it comes to words, to say nothing of deeds, everything becomes reversed.
The bikrus, however, have the ability to manifest their intelligence but, as I have said, in their being they are Behins and they are not free of imperfections and fixed ideas."
"Of fixed ideas?
What is this fixed idea?"
"To be a bikru is also in fact a monomania; the erroneous belief that with the Behins there is a connection between the heard word and the brain.
A bikru is a Behin whose only Behinity is that he doesn't realize among whom he lives; for it could not be imagined, could it, that somebody who was aware of the Behinic disease would still want to explain reality to them."
A deep awe-inspiring silence ensued, broken only by the song of the birds, and occasionally the murmur of the sea from far away.
Zatamon stood up and gestured towards the sun with his right arm.
"It is only the kazo that exists!"
As I looked up at him from my recumbent position, he stood there in the spring sun's flood of light like the statue of life regained.
A breeze ruffled the light folds in his clothes, his high bronzed forehead flashed in the sunshine while his eyes received the rays unblinkingly.
The trees in blossom on the mountain-side opposite us, the silvery spiral snaking upwards, the sea, the birds, the high-speed train shooting away below and this motionless 'health-man' merged in some marvellous harmony to an indivisible whole, a pure world, under the brilliance of the kazo.
And as the wretched writhing of the recent past occurred to me, I, too, opened my arms involuntarily towards the sun and heaved a sigh of rebirth.
The majesty of kazo played music in my heart.
After the sick and dark tortures, the gates were opened up before me, and intoxicated with knowledge I drank the light.
Zatamon sat down beside me.
The only thing I regretted was that I had learned something which I could not turn to the benefit of my own country.
First, because the Behinic disease was incurable, and also because it fortunately did not occur with us.
Looking back to the horrors of their freakish and atavistic brain, their whole fate appeared to me as automatic and inevitable.
"Now I understand you," I said, "I fully realize that the annihilation of the Behins was not an act of inhumanity - on the contrary, it was a necessary process, kazo itself, which could only happen this way, and was inevitable.
Salvation.
How excellent that I, a man accustomed to the sane British environment, have been rescued from so horrible a society!"
Zatamon looked into the distance for some time and then said pensively, "One actually doesn't know one's own voice, one hears it from inside - through the bones of the skull."
"What do you mean by that?"
"When I heard my own voice for the first time from a speaking device I did not recognize it.
I felt it to be alien."
"And what does that imply?"
"That you never recognized your own voice among the Behins because you were hearing it for the first time from outside."
"What?" I exclaimed, astounded.
"You cannot mean..."
"And you did not recognize your culture as it differs from theirs in form.
Their life destroys itself with different words from yours, but both are the same: Behinity.
Or was it not you who told me once that the content of life was not the hospital, the factory, bread and health but the soul?"
I darted up.
All of my limbs were a tremble.
"I hope you don't really mean that!" I cried.
"Do you want to compare us to pebble squeezing and copper-cube worshipping lunatics?!"
"And you will never see yourselves," he went on in an unchanged tone. "You travelled throughout Lilliput in vain as well.
Your Behin species merely entertains the children with amusing 'exoticism'.
You have also come to us in vain.
You are unaware of reason.
You are an atavistic, transitional species which must at first drive itself from the existing world so that the kazo should shape the harmonic form."
For minutes I was on the verge of assaulting him to put an end to his abuse.
I reminded myself in vain that I was dealing with a senseless automaton whose gramophone-like gabble should not be taken seriously but an insult had now been thrown at my nation which a gentleman had at all costs to avenge.
I say I was on the border of hitting him: he would not hit me back anyway, and it was indeed a miracle of self-control that I was able to curb my temper.
It occurred to me, however, that they might shut me up in the Behin settlement, or they would perhaps exterminate me as well, and among the Hins there was no law, justice and authority to appeal to for redress of the grievances one had suffered.
After a moment's hesitation, I looked him up and down contemptuously and without deigning to answer his words I turned my back on him.
And he looked after me without a word.
CHAPTER NINETEEN
Author wishes to attempt to get home but Zatamon does not share his views - Eventually author him self makes a boat and successfully sets out on the high seas
This scene had finally sealed my fate.
Zatamon's rough words had suddenly brought back to me the repulsive reality of Hin life which the intervening Behin horrors had made me forget.
All the hopelessness of their bleak existence unfolded before me one by one; loneliness, alienation, supreme indifference towards people, their rigid heartlessness, the monotonous buzz of the textile factory, and finally the most terrible memory Zolema the scentless flower.
I had never been faced with such a hopeless deadlock.
The knowledge that everything was hopeless slowly suppressed my indignation and I reached that illusive quietness in which one can even consider suicide coolly.
And yet there might be a third solution that could change everything for the best: if I could escape from this accursed island and get back to my own country.
Not even a prisoner would have clung to the thin ray filtering in to him through the bars with such desire as I embraced the hope of returning home.
As soon as the throbbing of my heart calmed down I tried to consider matters rationally and came to the decision that I should at all costs attempt to escape and only failing this should I do away with myself.
An enormous task lay ahead of me - that much was certain.
The Hins have no knowledge of navigation.
The land was everything to them, it formed and shaped their livelihood, their whole outlook was bound to it.
It was perhaps because of this that they could not soar spiritually either.
The trading of the Phoenicians, the fever of expansion of the Romans, the thirst for adventures of the Spanish and the buccaneering of the Normans - I would have looked for all of them in vain, not to mention my own country's sense of vocation in the field of spreading humanity and Christian civilization.
They knew that the earth was round and a hundred thousand times bigger than their island but they did not even try to get into touch with other peoples.
No desire, or even curiosity, for conquest or for riches, had driven them beyond their boundaries.
They were simply not interested in anything beyond their prime necessities.
They cultivated only those sciences that were of use to them.
The science of navigation was represented by some light boats in which they did some rowing on the river or by the shore, but one could never have ventured out onto the high seas in them even in the calmest weather.
Thus if I wanted to get away from here I would first have to build my own craft.
After prolonged hesitation I brought myself to putting my ill-feeling aside and decided to talk further with Zatamon and ask his help.
The next day towards evening I called upon him again.
I sincerely confided in him that I could not bear life on their island and if he did not want me to commit suicide he should procure the Hins' help.
I told him that I knew something about boat-building and, if I got a few men to help me, in two weeks we could patch up something seaworthy and they could get rid of me for good which was the only solution for both of us.
Zatamon replied that he did not understand why anybody wanted imperfection but it was a fact that Behins did indeed have such fixed ideas from which they could not be dissuaded.
However, the Hins could not be persuaded to perform anything which would entail harm for me.
"How do you imagine," he asked, "that a kazo being could deviate from the kazo?
You can't force fish onto land and you can't feed a dog on hay - if you attempted it they would not live."
This epitome of narrow-mindedness amazed me so much that for a few minutes I had no idea what to say.
To begin with I thought that it was his grievance from the previous day that made him speak like that, but that he wanted to conceal his resentment because of my behaviour.
And now he grasped the first opportunity to harm me, meanwhile hiding his spiteful intentions behind such a polite pretext.
The knowledge came back to me only slowly that they had no idea of politeness and of the basic rules of gentlemanly conduct.
But if lie really was not lying, then any further discussion would be a waste of breath.
Without a word I turned on my heels and left him for good.
I resolved that I would escape from them come what may.
As a last attempt I would try to assemble the boat alone -and would do away with myself only if this failed.
The next day I simply left the hospital.
Nobody looked for me.
I went into town.
I took a car and some tools from a garage, drove out a good distance from the town and, near a deep rivulet with a good flow of water surrounded by dense bush, I dismantled the engine.
The next day by another car I took other tools, some iron rods, sheets and different machine parts. I put up a tent made from some raincoats, and with great difficulty I hammered out a primitive screw and a rudder from the iron plates.
Then I took out boards, and eventually knocked together a small barge, managed to haul it into the water with rope pulleys and set about installing the engine.
When carrying the things out, I naturally had no difficulties, as the goods were not guarded by anyone. But the work still had to be done furtively as if they had seen it they would obviously have taken me for a Behin.
I do not want to bore the Reader with details, suffice it to say that I worked in the forest for three months. At night I slept over in the town, but at last I had a job which did not bore me.
Patriotism and homesickness spurred me on.
After three months I visited almost every warehouse with a huge truck.
From one I took three barrels of petrol, from another oil, then all kinds of food, bread, zwieback and tins in sufficient quantity for about three months.
Although my voyage was unlikely to take more than a couple of weeks, I thought that there was no reason not to stow away more if there was the wherewithal.
These things were not guarded in any way.
I also wondered what would happen if one day some rogue were to loot their warehouses.
On the other hand, it was true that their stocks were extraordinarily large, and it would not have been felt too keenly if they were looted by a hundred or even a thousand rogues. Besides there were no such people on the island.
Viewing their enormous warehouses, I preferred to think that as soon as I had reached home I would organize an expedition to return and set up the British flag representing Christian civilization, before some greedy colonizing country subjugated the honest people of the island.
So, step by step, I was filled with the awareness of my elevating calling; my arriving in Kazohinia had actually been the special grace of Providence granting me this glorious and patriotic mission.
This awareness afforded me new strength. I thanked the Lord of infinite mercy in Heaven in a fervent prayer, and then continued my lofty work with redoubled efforts.
Everything was ready but the supply of fresh water for which unfortunately I had no suitable container.
I certainly could not pour drinking water into a petrol drum!
It occurred to me that in the textile factory there was a lavatory where I had seen a hot-water container on the wall.
So I drove away to the factory and there I asked the first Hin I came across to help me take down the container.
He, of course, immediately lent his assistance unquestioningly.
It is certain that in this respect I already understood them.
He even helped to load it, and I could hardly restrain my laughter at the thought that the next day they would turn the tap in vain.
They would definitely believe that I had met with a fatal accident and that that was why I did not take the container back, from the "repair shop".
On the way I looked in on the geophysical institute from whose laboratory I collected a very fine compass, a sextant, a telescope and other essential instruments.
This, of course, I had to do cautiously, waiting until the physicists were occupied elsewhere.
All this I then transported onto my vessel.
As I had already accomplished my patriotic work, only the departure remained.
I set sail deliberately by day and into the bargain late in the afternoon when most of the Hins were strolling on the seashore.
Let them burst with rage seeing my vessel vanish from sight!
Accordingly I embarked before twilight, inspected everything thoroughly once more, and asking the Almighty's guidance for my voyage I started the engine and put to sea.
At a distance of about two hundred paces from the shore I altered course and progressed along the coastline of Kazohinia.
After the bushy parts the beach soon appeared.
Hundreds of Hins were there lying, walking, sitting or bathing.
My boat attracted the attention of many of them and, intoxicated with the sweet joy of freedom, I stood out on deck, waved my cap and kept on shouting "Hullo there," at the top of my voice.
All of a sudden all my pent-up human joy found an outlet after having had to contain itself among them.
The Hins certainly took note and with every face gaping vacantly they turned their attention towards me.
The knowledge that I was beyond their power and here and now I could do whatever I wished gave another impetus to my high spirits which burst forth irresistibly.
Throwing my cap into the air and myself to the floor, I kicked about, shouted good-bye to them and laughed incessantly.
They were astonished for a while and marvelled at me. They could not understand the situation. Many of them shouted out asking what had happened.
In reply I yelled "Good-bye" to them. They seemed to have interpreted this as a request for help and thinking that the water had cast me adrift, several Hins flung themselves into the sea. At this moment even the siren began to blow to indicate that someone was drowning and more than one rowing-boat started towards me with life-belts.
This comic turn of events made me laugh so that my abdominal muscles began to ache.
I let them come close, then opened, up the throttle and shot away from them.
Again I stepped on deck, jumping and dancing, and then I stuck out my tongue.
For a while they splashed about, then in bewilderment swam back to the shore.
As soon as I had left the crowded beach behind me, my heart suddenly jumped to my throat and for a moment I became serious.
The lonely rock emerged in front of me on which I had once sat with Zolema believing in a fit of passion that I had found something worthwhile.
High up, on the peak of the rock there stood a Hin.
Was it perhaps Zolema?
I was already fairly far from the shore, and could not make out.
Possibly it was not even a woman.
They were so uniform.
One of the many.
With an instinctive gesture I reached for my telescope but I scanned the face in vain, I could make out no features as the head was in eclipse with the setting sun and because of the strong light radiating around the face I was unable to distinguish any features.
My high spirits suddenly vanished, the grief of memories twisted my heart, and snatching at the rudder, I directed my craft at full throttle towards the open sea.
But I could not take my eyes off the figure.
It simply stood, like a statue, motionless, as if at one with the rock beneath.
As the distance between us grew greater and the rock receded farther and farther from my eyes, the whole figure gradually merged with the blinding flood of light from the sun.
As I moved further out to sea the sun was setting, as if it had followed the figure slowly sinking into the horizon, slowly diminishing and fusing with the light.
After a while I could no longer distinguish the rock itself.
The whole island was now in the halo of the setting sun, as it sank lower and lower until it disappeared with a last flare in the limitless water, snatching Kazohinia away for ever.
And from my heart an enormous stone fell away, at last I could leave far behind me that terrible island where heart, love and beauty were unknown concepts and where the bleak gaol of cheerless life had caused me so much suffering.
And as I advanced the hope of the other coast unfolded before my exulting mind's eye - that of the soul's land.
My pleasure was marred only by the fact, that my eyes ached for a considerable while. I severely rebuked myself for having tried to look into the sun; being a doctor I should have known that human eyes were not created for looking into too intense a light.
CHAPTER TWENTY
Author is caught in a storm - By good luck he meets the "Terrible" - He is kindly received by his fellow-officers - His arrival home
As I travelled farther and farther, my high spirits slowly returned, and an hour later I again wept, sang and danced, giving vent to all the pleasure, grief and feeling I had had to repress during my long year of imprisonment with the lunatics.
I travelled thus for two days.
Each night I slept no more than a; few hours.
On the third day, with the help of my instruments, I established that I had reached the line of the sea-lane to India.
I ought to sight land in two days at most.
The situation was all the more urgent as my engine, not accustomed to such a long running period, had to be stopped more and more frequently, to be cleaned or to have the sparking-plugs replaced.
On this day after lunch, black clouds suddenly gathered on the sky-line and after half an hour I was caught in a fierce storm.
The wind caught my boat amidships with terrific force and I feared it would sink.
Exerting myself to my utmost limit I continually bailed out the water, and set the engine into the wind at full throttle.
After half an hour of desperate struggling the engine stopped dead.
That was the last straw!
I opened up the engine immediately. Drenched to the skin, bailing out water with one hand and staggering from fatigue and exhaustion, I worked until I realized the horrible truth: two cylinders had seized up and no force could budge them.
I was entirely at the mercy of the elements.
But the best was yet to come.
When the storm abated my instruments told me that beyond doubt I was farther back than I had been.
I was in those very currents which had a year ago taken me at the beginning of my voyage to the island of the lunatics!
Indescribable despair overcame me. Lying in the bottom of my boat, I tore my hair and writhed about, and then absolutely beside myself, I got on my knees and prayed to God to save me this once more from having to relive the past monstrosities and help me back to life.
I vowed that I would never put to sea again.
Only the murmur of the sea responded to my words, and I decided that if I sighted the island, I would drown myself.
Evening came and the horizon dressed itself in black making the situation even more gloomy.
Although I could have lit a lamp as my batteries were not yet discharged, I did not dare to do so.
My eyes were just about to close with exhaustion when I caught sight of a point of light, very far away on the horizon.
Hope gave new strength to my limbs. I jumped up, picked up a reflector and waved it in that direction shouting at the top of my voice although I knew that it could not be heard at such a distance.
A quarter of an hour passed before I was noticed.
The blast of a siren replied, then I saw a hull turn towards me.
What I felt at that moment my Readers cannot imagine and I am unable to describe it, but for me it will for ever remain an unforgettable memory.
Tears welled up in my eyes and falling to my knees I stammered thanks to the infinitely merciful Lord of Heaven.
Half an hour later the ship was close to me and once I was able to read her name, I cried out in perfect ecstasy.
It was the "Terrible"!
When the life-boat reached me I embraced the very first sailor and kissed him on both cheeks.
Climbing aboard I was taken to the captain.
Here I could not control myself any more.
Falling to my knees I kissed the British flag; then, standing up I sang the National Anthem in an almost delirious joy, at which off went the caps from all the heads around me, and eyes dimmed with tears.
Nobody knew what was happening, but they felt it, and they did not disturb me.
It only occurred to me afterwards that I should introduce myself.
I outlined the situation briefly, at which the captain sent me to the admiral under the escort of a lieutenant.
We found the admiral in the mess, where the officers happened to be sitting at their dinner.
Seeing his decorative epaulettes I sprang to attention, introduced myself briefly, the admiral shook my hand, saying "How d'you do," and I again burst into tears.
However, he kindly beckoned to me to take a seat, the stewards set another place at the table, every piece of which was adorned with the Royal coat of arms. Then I was offered a small glass of whisky.
All this I had not seen or tasted for a whole year (or more, for all I knew!).
I could hardly recover from my joy and it took quite a time before I was able to send the first bite down my, throat, as sobs choked me.
After dinner the admiral himself asked me to say a few words about my experiences, in so far as my condition permitted it.
I heaved a deep sigh and set about relating everything.
Needless to say, in a few minutes I was forced to observe more than once indications of doubt on the faces of my fellow-officers - in spite of all their goodwill.
Lest they should take me for either a fool or a liar I also tried to submit material proof, Fortunately my craft had been lifted aboard, so I could show them some reviews entitled "Textile Industry" which I had used for packing, with pictures of the factory in them.
They began to take me seriously only when I read it fluently and explained it in translation.
Then, however, everyone gathered around me and they listened eagerly to my story.
The deathly hush was only occasionally broken by a burst of spontaneous laughter when I mentioned this or that piece of nonsense of the Hins or Behins, which abated and turned into comradely sympathy only when I called their attention to the fact that I was the party who had been subjected to all this.
It caused great amusement when I spoke of the foot snatching, the vake- vake, and the betik's copper cube, and I take pride in having caused some merry moments especially to the admiral who laughed so heartily at these unbelievable insanities and aimless stupidities that his decorations clinked on his chest.
Encouraged by this success, I, too, became animated and merry.
I spoke with enthusiasm of the yellow pebble, earless women, the bikbam, the inscrutable ketni and kipu, the men defending their being exploited, the shukk, the Bigrusts, and above' all of Zemoeki's boundless stupidity.
The amusement grew from minute to minute and reached its climax when I related that Zemoeki would not have recognized himself in my account of my travels and would only have laughed at the whole thing.
At this point I had to interrupt my words because my audience's abdominal muscles began to ache.
When, however, I arrived at my last story, that of the massacre which had raged on account of the circle and the square, the faces unexpectedly turned serious.
The admiral politely remarked that although he did not doubt my veracity, here, perhaps, I had not observed everything properly, for starting a bestial bloodshed because of soft-headed obsessions and geometrical figures would signify a complete lack of thinking capacity and brain, which was unbelievable not only of men but even of brute beasts.
To him it also seemed improbable that one professing truth and solid common sense with a clear conscience should be called an extremist and an exaggerating inciter and that such a man should be put to the stake as an enemy of order and civilization.
This was perhaps an exaggeration, being incredible not only to the European way of thinking but to any other outlook as well.
Surely something had escaped my attention or my sufferings had by that time dulled my senses.
His doubting my words was on the point of making me contradict; forgetting about the respect due, the description of the whole massacre was again on the tip of my tongue when I was astonished into silence.
As I thought it over, in this environment, I myself saw it to be so unbelievable that I considered it a dream.
It was only when I read my travel notes the next day that I became convinced once more that it had all been reality.
But that evening I did not dare to say any more.
And I finally abandoned the idea of telling, them about the bikru's tenets which I myself cannot entirely, believe even today.
Suddenly falling silent I answered that at that particular, moment I was not entirely sure of it myself, and I would prefer, to be excused from recalling the madness, and it might be better to switch over to the normal and nice things I had not had the opportunity to hear from my compatriots for such a long time.
My words were received with understanding, then the admiral stood up, and with a glass in his hand began to speak.
He saluted me informally, expressing his pleasure that I had been lucky enough to get back from among the lunatics to the world of civilization where I had the opportunity to re-enter the forces in the service of my adored country.
He enthusiastically reminded us of the greatness and special calling of our country, which had posted her as the guardian of peace and civilization.
And the trustee of this elevating vocation to safeguard the peace was the army, which ensured balance in the world, the survival of Christian justice and, last but not least, the tranquillity of the family hearths of British citizens.
With a transfigured expression he assured us in a raised voice that there was no more elevating awareness than to serve under the British flag as this was what led to true perfection of the soul, which filled the British citizen with pride and exalted him above all the other citizens of the world.
"To the heights of this happy feeling," he said, "only the living and warm heart of a patriot can rise, in which the sacred respect for ideals and traditions is alive, while the barren, bleak soul remains far from it and loses its way in the desert.
The respect for the flag and the Bible gives an unswerving aim which adds aim and content to our life, which distinguishes us from the brute beast; that is what steels our arms in the noble battles, that is what makes the sons of the nation heroes who are happy to sacrifice their lives for honour and for the glory of death in action.
"The respect for military virtues and the national ideal is the source of the life of the peoples, without which our fate would be death and ruin.
Let us therefore foster higher ideas in our heart, our steadfast devotion to the Bible and our country, for a British patriot lives or dies with his sword and honour.
"For the time being we don't know," he went on, "whether the war to come will be fought against Germans, French or Japanese, but wherever we shall be called by His Majesty's order we shall hasten without thought or hesitation to defend the flag, that much is certain.
"I firmly believe that when the bugle-call is heard, every citizen, regardless of sex and age, will be happy to sacrifice his or her life for the ideals and the flag, for even if all of us should die, Great Britain and her ideals will live for ever!"
Proposing to the health of His Majesty he emptied his glass. Then picking up the small flag that had stood on the table and holding it aloft, he shouted three cheers for king and country.
A soul-stirring scene followed.
The officers jumped up, tears shone in every eye, and we all broke into 'God Save the King'.
After the last chord sounded the officers embraced each other, and it was minutes before everyone sat down again.
Now the officers wanted to have a word from me.
I would have liked to thank them fittingly for the rapturous happiness that filled me now that I was in their circle after such a long period of deprivation.
I rose, but the glass trembled in my hand.
My throat tightened; and in the end all I could do was shout in a voice touched with, emotion, "My country!
My King!
My life is yours!"
What should have followed was suppressed by my fit of, sobbing and the thunderous cheering of my fellow-officers.
Returning home to Redriff I found my wife and children in good health.
The pleasure of seeing me again at first prevented my spouse from speaking, but then, bursting into tears of emotion, she said that I was already considered dead by everybody.
I tried to comfort her with tender words saying that I had no more troubles and was able to devote my life to her and to my country.
Still sobbing, she asked me with the anxiety of the concerned wife whether, since the life insurance had already been spent for the proper conservation of the splendour of my house, it would not be advisable for me to return inconspicuously to Kazohinia to wait there until the thirty years required for the statutory limitation had expired.
This, of course, I could not accept because it would have been bordering on fraud, which was alien to the character of a British citizen.
And, furthermore, the whole staff of officers was already aware of my arrival.
Thus I reassured my wife by saying that we should be perfectly able to pay back the insurance money after I had published the account of my travels, as my experiences were so educative that any government would highly appreciate them and patronize their distribution in order that the subjects should learn, from the description of a society consisting of unworthy and stupid Behins and governed by vicious leaders, to appreciate their own environment.
And when my tactful but nevertheless determined attitude had also made the gigolo leave my house, the domestic peace which is so pleasant a feature of the cosy English home was completely restored.
