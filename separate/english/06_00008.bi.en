Albrecht Dürer - Portrait of a Man
This is one of the most famous paintings in the Museum of Fine Arts.
The black damask cloak with its fur collar, typical of men's fashion at the time of the German renaissance, and the hairnet over the long hair, are both indicative of wealth.
The picture clearly portrays the extremely open features and emotions of the young man.
Dürer painted the hair and eyebrows using an extremely thin brush, which is a device often employed in his portrait painting.
The smile on the tightly sealed lips has a striking resemblance to the works of Leonardo da Vinci.
Now there are further works by Dürer for the public to admire in the Museum of Fine Arts.
One can marvel at the 3.5 x 3-metre woodcut and at one of the largest prints ever produced, which are the 36 sheets that make up the Triumphal Arch of Emperor Maximilian I. The series of engravings on the Triumphal Procession of Emperor Maximilian I could actually be stretched out to over 50 metres and utilize 135 individual sheets.
Alongside other renaissance masters, Dürer took an active role in the creation of both of these unique works.
