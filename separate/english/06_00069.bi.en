Váci street property transaction
In the second half of 2003Biggeorge’s International JSC has realized one of the latest deals in the market of investment estate.
Biggeorge’s International JSC, assigned by Wallis Ingatlan JSC has sold the 4,690 m2 office building under Váci street 17, in district XIII not long ago.

According to Adorján Salamon, chief executive of Biggeorge’s International JSC, in the past few years the district XIII has become one of the most dynamically developing districts of the capital, becoming one of the highlighted areas of the real estate market of Budapest.

This change is embodied in large-scale and spectacular real estate development during which a number of office and commercial investments are concentrated here.
Characteristic examples include Wallis Ingatlan JSC, Plaza Centers, Ablon Ltd. or the real estate projects of BSR Europe.
The mid-term development plans of the above corporations predict the further dynamic development of the region.
Normatech Ltd., the new owner of the office building gives a complete renovation to the building and is willing to make it capable of accommodating quality office, commercial and other activities (e.g. fitness salon).
According to current rules, the 5-level corner estate can be extended through building a new floor and by the reuse of the plot nearly 15,000 square metres of new office space can be built.
Extension and redevelopment of the building is feasible, being excellent for commercial and office use.
After the EU accession the investor is expecting significant rise in the value stemming from the unique position of the estate.
According to Biggeorge’s International JSC that was assigned with further utilization of the estate and has completed the sale in five months for two million euros, the building, based on its finish and position, has both excellent developmental and lease potentials considering the absence of developmental and investment opportunities of similar position in Váci street.
