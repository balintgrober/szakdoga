ReSource Property awards 2003
At a gala reception, attended by almost 600 people, 2003 awards were presented to real estate developers or owners and to the best performing consultancy that were considered to be the best in the major sectors of the real estate market by the readership of ReSource.
The main aim of the awarding was to create publicity in Hungary for the most accomplished buildings, for the best performing consultancy company and for the real estate market itself.
Awards were given for projects in the office, retail, industrial and residential sectors and consultancy categories.
Prizes were presented at the joined Christmas Mixer of ReSource and BBJ at the WestEnd Hilton hotel on December 5 2003 along with the BBJ Business Awards 2003.
Voters were asked to make their choices based on efficiency of building and business centres (in terms of design and execution, quality of materials, and location), exterior and interior architectural merit, commercial success and the contribution of that project to the market with the services it provided.
In the consultancy section the decision was based on which company was the most successful commercially, which has contributed the most to the market and which was the most efficient.
