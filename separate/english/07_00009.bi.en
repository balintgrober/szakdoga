CROSS AND CRESCENT
THE TURKISH AGE IN HUNGARY (1526-1699)
HISTORY
POLITICAL AND MILITARY HISTORY
At the borderline of two empires
The Hungarian Kingdom, which incorporated the whole territory of the Carpathian Basin, was the most significant state in Central Europe in the 15th century.
Distinguished dynasties, such as the Luxemburgs, the Habsburgs and the Jagellos, who saw the chance to make Hungary the center of a great empire, competed for the throne.
But all their plans failed as the Hungarian ruler had a very significant rival in the Osman dynasty.
After the defeat at Nándorfehérvár in 1521 the armed forces of the Osman empire managed to destroy the borderline defense system of the Hungarian Kingdom within a few years' time.
Consequently the defeat at Mohács in 1526 was inevitable.
The country lost its southern territories, its ruler and political-military leaders.
At the same time, however, Chief Prince Ferdinand, who ruled the neighbouring Austrian provinces and represented the other great empire, the Habsburg empire, came to Hungary's aid - primarily to defend his own territories.
So Hungary soon became the battlefield of the two great empires of the age.
The Habsburgs' road to the Hungarian Crown
The rise of the Habsburgs, who originated from Switzerland, was closely tied to the history of the Hungarian Kingdom.
Their first emperor, Rudolph I (1273-1291), was helped by King Ladislaus the Cuman (1272-1290) to conquer the Austrian provinces, when in 1278, in the battle of Morvamezõ he supported Rudolph against the Czech king, Ottocar (1253-1278).
By the 15th century, however, the neighbour had become a rival, then, by the next century a world empire.
Owing to their successful marriage policy, the Habsburgs incorporated Burgundy, Spain and the Kingdom of Naples, and from the reign of Albert II - emperor and Hungarian king (1437-1439) - they filled the position of the German-Holy Roman emperor until 1805.
From this time on their main aim was to obtain the Hungarian throne.
Friedrich III (1440-1493), then his son, emperor Maximilian I (1493-1506) did not succeed, although they had signed several treaties with the Hungarian rulers (1563, 1491, 1506) in order to acknowledge their right to inherit the Hungarian crown.
These were followed by a marriage contract in 1515, according to which Ferdinand Habsburg married Louis II (1516-1526)'s sister, Anna Jagello, and the Hungarian king married Maria Habsburg.
After Louis II's death in 1526 Ferdinand was easily able to occupy the Hungarian throne.
The road of the Turkish empire to Hungary
The Osman-Turkish principality was formed at the end of the 13th century in the north-western part of Asia Minor (Anatolia).
Osman (?-1326), who gained respect for both the dynasty and the empire, and his successors expanded at a rapid pace, so by the end of the 14th century they had occupied the Balkan peninsula and the majority of the states of Asia Minor.
They reached the Hungarian border at around 1390.
The crusades, which were organised to push them back (1396: Nicapole, 1444 Várna...etc.) were all unsuccessful.
However, they were halted for a brief period by Timur Lenk (1402: Ankara).
Sultan Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (Byzantium) in 1453, then he defeated the sea power of the age, Venice in a protracted war, and he also reorganised his own state according to despotic principles.
His grandson, Selim I expanded the territory of the empire to cover Syria and Egypt.
In 1520, when Suleiman I mounted the throne, the territory of the Osman empire was over 1,5 million square kilometres (in contrast, the territory of the Hungarian Kingdom was only 300,000 square kilometres only) and the population was about 12-13 million (while that of Hungary was only 3-3,2 million). His annual revenues were around 4-5 million Forints (while the Hungarian kings had only 250,000-300,000 Forints).
His army was stronger than the united armed forces of Europe, and his fleet was able to break the monopoly of Venice, so he could take control of the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.
Turkish political goals and military campaigns in Hungary
It was sultan Mehmed II who launched the programme of reestablishing the Roman empire, that is occupying Christian Europe, but it had to be put off due to internal and external reasons.
Only Suleiman could start it, whose main aim was to incorporate Hungary so that he could use the country as his base to attack the German-Holy Roman Empire.
In 1521 he conquered Nándorfehérvár, the 'core' of the country, then on 29 August, 1526 he defeated the main army of the Hungarian Kingdom on the battlefield of Mohács.
After Ferdinand was chosen to be the Hungarian king, he did not continue the occupation of the country, but started to siege Vienna in 1529.
His attack, however, was unsuccessful, similarly to his campaign in 1532.
Suleiman could not conquer Europe, and even the occupation of Hungary seemed to be a difficult task for him.
So in the 1530s he supported János Szapolyai to be Hungarian king, but then after Szapolyai's death occupied some of his territories.
Later he and his successors continuously expanded in Hungary and tried to attack Vienna, but could not effect any major changes.
Half a decade of chaos after Mohács: two kings in one country
After the defeat at Mohács the Hungarian orders chose two kings one after the other: first the majority of the nobility chose János Szapolyai (1526-1540), who was one of the most highly respected lords of the country, then a smaller group chose Ferdinand Habsburg, Czech king and Austrian chief prince (1526-1564).
The next 15 years were characterised by armed struggles of the two kings, that is, a civil war.
Although there were two rulers in the country, the events were controlled by a third person, Emperor Suleiman (1520-1564).
With his campaign against Vienna in 1529 he forced King Szapolyai to enter into an alliance, while with his Kõszeg expedition in 1532 he let the Habsburgs know that he considered them an enemy.
Meanwhile the population of the country had to choose which king to support.
It was a very difficult task however, since neither of the nominees had enough power to attain their goals.
As a result of this there were several treasons and changes in the parties, that is, there was complete chaos and a state of crisis in the country.
The country is finally divided into three parts
The two kings could not subdue one another, so they finally signed a secret treaty at Várad on 24 February, 1538, in which Szapolyai claimed that after his death his territories would be inherited by his rival.
The efforts to unite the country all failed.
After King Szapolyai's death in 1540 Ferdinand twice tried to occupy the capital city, Buda (1540, 1541), but did not succeed.
Sultan Suleiman did not want to unite the country at all, on the contrary, he wanted to split the country.
After his triumphs in Persia he sought to finalise the situation in Hungary, so he occupied Buda on the 15th anniversary of the battle of Mohács, on 29 August, 1541.
So the medieval Hungarian Kingdom, which had been heading for disintegration since 1526, was now divided into three parts (Royal Hungary, Turkish Hungary and the Transylvanian principality) and remained so for the next 150 years.
György Fráter as governor (1542-1551)
In 1541 Queen Isabella, János Szapolyai's widower, and her son, János Zsigmond (János II) escaped from Buda to Lippa and they were accompanied by brother György Utyesenich (by his mother's name Martinuzzi), a Paulian monk, and an outstanding politician of the age.
György Fráter took an oath at János I's death bed to protect the interests of his children, then he moved the royal court to Gyulafehérvár in Transylvania.
He governed Transylvania and the neighbouring territories in the name of the queen till his death in 1551.
Besides being a governor, he was the treasurer, from 1544 the chief judge and bishop of Várad.
György Fráter tried to maintain good relationship with the Turks, but he realised that uniting the three parts of the country could be carried out only under the reign of the Habsburgs.
He believed that King Ferdinand I would be supported by his emperor brother in the war against the Turks, and in such a way Hungary could be saved.
However, Ferdinand had him murdered during the night of 17 December, 1551 in the castle of Alvinc because of his suspicious relationship with the Turks.
Fortress wars in Hungary
In 1542 King Ferdinand tried to reoccupy Buda with the help of troops financed from German emperial benefits, but his campaign was a total failure.
As a result of this the Habsburg ruler was forced to follow a defensive policy, as the Turks wanted to reach Vienna after occupying Hungary.
With this the age of fortress wars started, which lasted until 1566. The plains of the country were taken over by the Turks, but at the same time the Habsburgs established a strong border defence line.
Meanwhile in Transylvania an independent principality was formed under the reign of János Zsigmond (1540-1571).
By occupying Esztergom, Székesfehérvár, Pécs, then Vác and Hatvan the Turks expanded the territory of their Buda vilayet, then in 1552 they formed their second province after conquering Temesvár and the west of the region beyond the river Tisza.
In the meanwhile, however, they occupied the fortresses of Veszprém and Palota for a short period of time.
Only the heroic warriors of Eger were able to stop them.
In 1554 the fortress of Fülek surrendered, too, which became the northernmost base and administrational center of the Turks.
In 1566 two essential royal fortresses, Szigetvár and Gyula were also taken by the Turkish oppressors.
Ferdinand's reign in Transylvania (1552-1556)
According to the deal signed by György Fráter at Nyírbátor in 1549 in the name of Queen Isabella Transylvania and the nearby castle districts in the region beyond the river Tisza, which adjoined it, fell into the hands of King Ferdinand.
The Queen and his son were given an annuity and two principalities in Silesia (Oppeln and Ratibor) as recompense.
General Castaldo and his army of 6-7,000 marched into Transylvania in the summer of 1551 and they conquered the country in the name of King Ferdinand.
The king appointed two voivodes: István Dobó and Ferenc Kendy.
The occupation of Transylvania by the Habsburgs was retorted.
Sultan Suleiman launched another campaign against Hungary in 1552, during which the Turks occupied the region between the rivers Maros and Tisza, and the fortresses of Temesvár and Szolnok.
Ferdinand I could not defend his newly acquired eastern territories, and Transylvania could not support Castaldo's unpaid soldiers.
In 1553 General Castaldo escaped back to his home and by that time the Transylvanian orders also realised that they should accept the sovereignty of the ruler appointed by the sultan from the Szapolyai dynasty to maintain peace.
In 1556 they brought Queen Isabella and her son, Zsigmond János back to govern Transylvania.
The return of Isabella and Zsigmond János
In November 1556 the Transylvanian orders took an oath at the meeting of the parliament to be loyal to Queen Isabella and chosen king Zsigmond János, who had returned from Poland.
The Queen governed the country in association with the government appointed to help her till her death in 1559.
The most important achievement of her reign was a reform in the chancellery, which was carried out by her counselor, Mihály Csáky, who was with her in her exile.
Csáky organised the chancellery, which took over control of the government of the principality, according to late medieval patterns. The chancellery worked as the only tool of government under the direct control of the principals during the existence of the principality.
State administration started with this, and after a short transitional period Transylvania - together with the castle districts beyond the river Tisza, which joined the principality - functioned as an independent state.
The stronghold of Christianity: the establishment of the borderline defense system against the Turks
While the Osman troops were continuing to occupy the central part of the country after 1541, Ferdinand I's military leaders started to establish a new borderline defense system.
In Vienna they realised that they had to bring the enemy to a half within the territory of Hungary, outside the borderline of the permanent Austrian provinces - no matter how much it cost.
Although this battlefield was a great sacrifice from the Hungarian population, it was the only way to save the country.
The defense system, called propugnaculum Christianitis in Hungary, was finally organised by the Viennese Royal Military Council in the 1570s.
The 100-120 border fortresses were divided into six border headquarters (Croatia, Slavonia, Kanizsa, Gyõr, Bányavidék and Upper Hungary). The most significant fortresses were fortified according to the plans of Italian military architects, and in Komárom a sloop fleet was set up to defend the river Danube.
More than 60% of the 20,000-22,000 soldiers' pay was financed by foreign provinces which ensured their defense within the territory of Hungary.
The Turkish border fortress system
After occupying the capital city it took the Turks at least another three decades to establish a border defense system, which closed the borders of the empire guaranteeing safety for Buda and the military road along the Danube.
This system consisted of several fortresses, the number of which depended on luck in military actions (100-130).
By the turn of the 16-17th centuries a multi-layer fortress network had been formed; the main defense was based on a couple of huge fortresses (Buda-Pest, Esztergom, Temesvár, then in the 17th century Kanizsa, Eger, Várad and Érsekújvár - the majority of them were centers of provinces as well), and there were 1000-2000 quards in them.
Besides these big fortresses the borderline was defended by a chain of smaller fortresses (Szigetvár, Palota, Fülek, Hatvan) with an army of 400-500 soldiers.
Behind them there was the second line of defense with fortresses and 100-300 soldiers in each, and the third line of defense consisted of fortified rims with 50-100 people in each.
In the Turkish border fortresses there were 18,000-19,000 soldiers.
Among the guards there were units of horseman (gönüllü, faris, martaloc) and infantry (yanichar, müstahfiz, azab, topchi) and supplementary units. Along the major rivers there were independent sloop fleets under the commandership of captains (kapudans).
The total sum paid to these soldiers was more than all the revenues of the Hungarian province, and in the 17th century soldiers' pay was financed from taxes directed from the Balkans.
The difficulties facing the government of Royal Hungary
From the 1540s the Hungarian orders several times requested that King Ferdinand should finance the border fortresses from the revenues of his foreign provinces, however, they could not accept the consequences.
The Turkish subsidies, which were needed for the survival of the country, had a very big price: those who gave money for their defense, wanted to take part in the decisions made in connection with this issue, even if they were domestic issues in Hungary.
Owing to this fact by the 1560s the Hungarian orders were totally ousted from controlling the three main branches of state administration: from military, foreign and financial affairs.
From this time on these issues were directed from Vienna till 1848.
However, the Hungarian nobility played an important role in the local administration of border fortresses, and in the fields of domestic policy, justice and the privileges of orders they did not tolerate the interference of the court.
Military revolution in Hungary
The revolutionary changes in European military affairs, which took place from the first half of the 16th century, played a very important role in the successful border defense in Hungary.
A fundamental change was the spread of firearms.
This required totally new designs in fortress architecture, then it brought about a significant increase in the number of soldiers in the army. Owing to this fact tactics and strategies also changed.
All these had a great impact on the development of state and financial administration, natural and military science and economy.
As the Osmans could not keep up with European development, the Christians gained military superiority on the Hungarian battlefield - thanks to small arms.
However, this was not enough to drive the Turks out of the country.
Turkish military forces in Hungary
The Osman-Turkish military command could base their actions on fortress soldiers, fleets on rivers and the army of horseman (spahis).
These spahis were given service estates in return for their work, and they were obliged to set up a little army, where the number of armed men was in proportion to their income.
Those who broke this rule or refused to fight, lost their estates.
Spahis were responsible to the sandjak begh whose sandjak comprised their estates.
The deputy of the sandjak begh was called alaj begh, and the officers under their command were the subashis and cheribasis.
In battle Spahis were equipped with metal helmets, coats of mail, arm and leg mail, spears and bows.
Their number (together with their armed escorts) was around 7,000-9,000 in Hungary in the 16th century.
In the 17th century the importance of the spahi army was less significant, and there is no data on their numbers.
"Years of peace in war" throughout a quarter of a century (1568-1591)
Two years after Miklós Zrínyi's heroic struggle at Szigetvár in 1566, emperor Maximilian II (1566-1576) and sultan Selim II (1566-1574) made peace in Drinaple, which brought peace for a quarter of a century in Hungary.
There were no major campaigns in the country till 1591, but the continuous plundering of Hungarian and Turkish border fortress watches to the territory of the enemy made everyday life difficult.
These attacks caused only temporary problems for the population.
Indeed, this peaceful period during the Turkish occupation encouraged a limited economic boom.
But these years of peace were not advantageous for border defense, since the sorely needed foreign financial aid did not arrive too often.
This is why Hungary started a long war against the Turks with a rather old and outdated border fortress system.
The Speyer contract
In 1559 the 19-year old János Zsigmond Szapolyai who was chosen to be king at his birth, became the ruler in Transylvania.
The most important theological disputes of the Reformation took place during his reign (1559-1571), and even Zsigmond János himself came to know unitarism, originating from Lutheran thoughts, following the theological instructions of Ferenc Dávid and Doctor Blandrata.
In the meanwhile he was constantly at war with the Habsburgs over the territories of Upper Hungary, but by 1562 he had lost the regions of Szatmár, Tokaj and Kassa.
In the same year he exacted bloody revenge on the Székely revolt, he deprived the Székelys of their old privileges.
At the end of his reign, in August, 1570 he managed to sign the Speyer treaty with Hungarian King, Maximilian Habsburg I. It was the first international diplomatic agreement, in which Transylvania - with the territories annexed to it (known as Partium) - was referred to as an independent state.
According to this agreement Zsigmond János could bear the title Principal of Transylvania, but not for long, as a few days after the ratification of the treaty by the Regensburg parliament in March 1571, he died.
Principal of Transylvania: István Báthori (1571-1586)
After Zsigmond János's death (1571) the orders of Transylvania, disregarding the Speyer treaty, chose István Báthori from Somlyó as their ruler.
At first Báthori called himself voivode - showing that he accepted the treaty - but later, when he was chosen Polish king (1575), he started to use the title principal.
In summer of 1575 he triumphed over Gáspár Bekes (who was a pretender supported by the Habsburgs) in the battle of Kerelõszentpál.
In the next year he removed his residence to Krakow and appointed his elder brother, Kristóf, to the head of Transylvania to rule in his name as a voivode.
He tried to govern Transylvania from Poland, so he set up a Transylvanian chancellery there, too, but he was unable to keep in contact with the Transylvanian nobles.
In 1583, after his brother's death, he appointed his own son, Zsigmond Báthori, to his place, who was assisted by a governing council of three.
The members of his council were chosen from among the humanist "Padovians".
The principal - as Polish king - was engaged in organising an anti-Turkish eastern coalition (1582) and he tired to gain the support of the papacy.
His unexpected death in 1586 put an end to his plans.
Transylvania and the Porte
Turkish political leaders considered the state of Transylvania to be their vassal state, and this fact had a strong influence on the relationship between Transylvania and the Porte.
In contrast to Rumanian voivode districts, Transylvania was much freer.
To express the acknowledgement of her dependence on the Porte), Transylvania paid 10,000 Forints of tax from 1542, which was increased to 20,000 at the end of the 16th century, and to 40,000 during the reign of Principal Mihály Apafi (1660-1690), but the Turkish system of taxation was not introduced here at all.
It was a tradition that the principals chosen by the Transylvanian orders could mount their thrones only after the arrival of the ahdname, the official appointment, and the emblems of principality.
In contrast to this, in Moldavia and Havasalföld (High Alps) voivodes were appointed by the Porte from among loyal candidates.
The Principal of Transylvania was free to deal with domestic matters, but in regard to foreign affairs he could not act against the interests of the Porte. However, during the reign of strict rulers, the country could pursue an independent foreign policy.
These political acts were either revenged later, or forgotten by Turkish political leaders.
Whereas in Rumanian voivode districts both domestic and foreign affairs were directed according to the economic-political interests of the Porta.
The crisis of the Turkish empire
By the end of the 1580s the Osman-Turkish empire had suffered a general crisis.
Earlier the strongly centralised government exercised total control over economy and society, but now they could not solve the serious problems caused by natural catastrophes, the growth of the population, the crisis in agriculture, difficulties in supply, the influence of inflation in the international economy (price revolution), social movements (provincial revolts) and military revolts.
The balance of the state economy was broken, as a result of the costs of the long Persian war (1568-1590) and the reorganisation of the army (the increase in the number of yanichars and their firearm equipment) were too high.
The Turkish province in Hungary was in crisis as well.
In the "years of peace in war" the Turkish army stationed in Hungary grew slack: due to the loose discipline and lack of money the soldiers deserted their posts.
Public security and profitability were in decline because of the attacks of Hungarian fortress soldiers.
Although the treasury of the state was empty, in 1593 the Osman leaders decided on another war against Hungary (under the influence of Hungarian and Bosnian military lobbies) to avoid the loss of their military positions in Hungary and to get rid of their mercenary soldiers from Istambul, who were constantly revolting.
The fifteen-year long war: the first modern war of Hungary (1591-1606)
From 1591 there were big battles between the Habsburgs and the Osman empire in the territory of Croatia, then after the Christian victory at Sziszek in June 1593, then two years later at the border of Transylvania.
The fifteen-year long, or long Turkish war was the first modern war of Hungary, in which serious weapons were used.
Thanks to the military revolution, Christian troops were in an advantageous situation, but the first period of the war (1591-1596) brought Turkish success.
In 1592 they occupied the core of the Croatian border defense system, Bihács, in 1593 they conquered Veszprém and Palota, then in 1594 the fortress of Gyõr, which defended Vienna and Austria.
Two years later in the battle of Mezõkeresztes, which was the first open battle after Mohács, sultan Mehmed III (1595-1603), himself, took part in the fighting, and defeated the Christian army, ensuring the occupation of the fortress of Eger, which had been taken two weeks before.
Only Miklós Pálffy's 1593-1594 winter campaign could blunt the success of the Turkish army by taking back several fortresses in county Nógrád.
In the second period of the war (1597-1606) it was difficult to decide which army had performed the best.
Both parties had victories and took some important fortresses (the Christian army 1598: Gyõr, 1601: Székesfehérvár; the Turkish army 1600: Kanizsa, 1602: Székesfehérvár). However, continuous fighting proved only one thing: neither of the parties could win.
Advantages of the Christian army in military technology were balanced by the well-organised reserves of the Osmans and their advantage in number.
The replacement and logistics of the Christian troops were still based on the financial aid offered by orders of the Habsburg countries, which made the Christian army rather inefficient.
When the war turned into the Bocskai revolt in 1604, both parties welcomed the 1606 Zsitvatorok peace, as the long war destroyed large tracts of the country and exhausted the treasuries of both empires.
Zsigmond Báthori (1588-1602) and the war at the end of the century
The 16-year old Zsigmond of the Báthori family took over the principality in 1588. He had an unstable nervous system and he had numerous personal problems.
In 1593 he joined the 15-year war and owing to his military success he reclaimed several border fortresses for Transylvania.
In the meanwhile he was at constant war with the orders of his country, many of whom did not support his war at all.
However, his uncle - his chief political advisor and an outstanding military commander -, István Bocskai was in favour of the war.
In the 1595 Prague treaty Zsigmond Báthori acknowledged the superiority of Hungarian king, Rudolf Habsburg over Transylvania.
Imperial General Giorgio Basta and Havasalföld voivode Mihály Vitéz arrived for the takeover of power in 1599.
But Mihály Vitéz wanted the principality for himself, so general Basta quickly had him murdered.
Zsigmond Báthori was refused the throne several times, then returned to Transylvania, and then for the fourth time in 1602 he finally left the country and spent the rest of his life in Rudolf's court in Prague.
The raids and cruelty of General Basta's mercenary soldiers destroyed the population in Transylvania, while famine and plague also killed a lot of people.
The carriage of Basta became a notion in the region, and by 1604 Transylvania was already dying.
The crisis of the Transylvanian principality
During the military and political events of the fifteen year war it was impossible for the Transylvanian principality to survive.
In the struggle between the Osman and Habsburg empires there was an opportunity for the Habsburgs to gain the upper hand and conquer the eastern part of the country, including Transylvania.
The imperial forces could not keep up with the Turkish military force, so there was a balance of power, which created the political conditions for Transylvania to become an independent state in the middle of the 16th century.
General Basta marched out of Transylvania in 1604, the Habsburgs could not settle here permanently.
The orders of Transylvania took the necessary measures to be able to survive: they joined Bocskai's movement, and in the autumn of 1604 they chose the aristocrat as their principal.
Sultan Ahmed I's official appointment also arrived, in which the politician Gábor Bethlen played a very significant role.
The Vienna peace, which put an end to the Bocskai movement, resettled the Transylvanian principality, and Bocskai acquired the counties Szatmár, Bereg and Ugocsa and the fortress of Tokaj.
The influence of the Turkish-Persian relationship on Hungary
The Osman-Persian peace made in 1590 was preserved until 1603.
During this time Persia's young and talented ruler, Shah Abbas (1587-1629) reorganised the military affairs of the country.
Instead of a temporary army he set up a permanent one, following Osman example.
Within this army he set up artillery and firearm divisions (he was aware of the importance of firearms), and the total number of the soldiers here was over 20,000.
In 1599 he sent ministers to western Christian principals, asking for their support for an alliance and an anti-Osman war.
Although this alliance did not come into being, he took the advantage of the situation (in which the Osmans were exhausted and bound to Hungary) and launched an attack against the eastern borders of the Turks in 1603.
He forced the Osmans to withdraw their forces from Hungary.
This war lasted till 1639 - with short breaks - and was significant in that the court of the sultan started to negotiate peace with the Hungarian king. In the following decades the sultan enthusiastically sought to maintain peace with Hungary.
István Bocskai's revolt: the opening of a series of conflicts of the Hungarian orders
The revolt in 1604, led by István Bocskai - who led the movement of the Upper-Hungarian orders - was the culmination of the Habsburg-Hungarian conflicts.
The dissatisfaction of the orders was caused by the fiscal lawsuits against aristocrats who had been loyal to the Habsburgs earlier and the court's violations of law and anti-Reformation pursuits.
After chief captain Giacomo Belgiojoso gave back the St Elisabeth church of Kassa to the Catholics at the beginning of 1604 using military force, armed conflict was unavoidable.
Bocskai soon occupied the whole kingdom with the help of the hajdus, who came over from the imperial army.
Owing to his success he was chosen principal first by the Transylvanian, then by the Hungarian orders in the first half of 1605.
His anti-Habsburg efforts soon made him enter into an alliance with the Turks, who did not refuse Emperor Rudolf II (1576-1612)'s peace offer in November 1605.
The armed struggles between the Hungarian orders and the Viennese court were stopped by a Viennese peace treaty made in June 1606 by István Illésházy.
The principality of Zsigmond Rákóczi (1607-1608) and Gábor Báthori (1608-1613)
In his will, Bocskai appointed Bálint Drugeth Homonnai as his successor, but Gábor Báthori also had the chance to be chosen principal.
In 1607, however, the Transylvanian orders voted for Zsigmond Rákóczi, the old, experienced soldier.
Gábor Báthori gained the support of the Porta, persuaded the hajdus (who were in an insecure position and threatened with losing their privileges after Bocskai's death) to join him, and made Rákóczi abdicate in 1608.
During his short reign, Gábor Bethlen turned the Transylvanian orders against himself.
He took over the center of the Saxons, Nagyszeben, and made their cities cover the costs of his and his court's entertainment.
In 1610 he had the Hungarian lords who joined a conspiracy against him beheaded.
He attacked the Havasalföld for no reason, and he also almost entered into a war with Moldavia.
In 1613 he made a promise to let the Habsburg troops march into Transylvania, but he could not do so, because the Porta had enough of his chaotic policy, too and appointed a new principal to the head of Transylvania.
Consolidating orders
The Vienna peace, then the 1608 parliament (which enacted it) brought significant changes in the relationship of the court and the Hungarian orders.
The ruler promised to keep Hungarian law, freedom of worship and to give the most important offices to Hungarians.
From 1608 on the office of the palatine - which was not held for half a century - was again filled.
Besides these the Habsburg rulers were obliged to acknowledge the independence of Transylvania.
The orders realised that they could benefit from the fact that the country was divided: the Transylvanian state, which was a vassal of the Turks, was a winning card for them to defend their rights against the interests of the court.
In spite of the fact that the orders became stronger, the control of military, foreign and financial affairs remained the privilege of Viennese central offices.
Hungary in the Thirty Years' war
A new European conflict, the Thirty Years' war (1618-1648) started with the revolt of the Czech orders in May 1618 in Prague.
This movement, which was initiated by religious offences, soon became a pan-European series of conflicts, in which the Habsburgs and their major rival, France fought for European hegemony.
Hungary - defending the Habsburg empire from the Turks - could not be left out of the confrontation despite the fact that the Military Court Council was in favour of maintaining peace on the Hungarian battlefield for more than 50 years.
In contrast with the peaceful period in the 16th century the territory of the country was a battlefield again - in spite of the alliance with the Turks.
The Transylvanian principals' troops (mainly light cavalry), first those of Gábor Bethlen (1613-1624), then those of György Rákóczi I (1630-1648) destroyed the country, followed by regular imperial armies, which pushed them back.
In the meanwhile, Hungarian border fortress warriors, who were on field duty, died in the German empire for their Habsburg rulers who actually lost the war from the political aspect.
The great principal: Gábor Bethlen (1613-1629)
Gábor Bethlen was appointed principal at the Porte.
The Transylvanian orders chose him in 1613 "in fear, but free" as they followed him to Transylvania with a Turkish-Tartar army of 80,000 behind them.
In the first years of his reign he made peace with the Saxonians, reconciled with the old Hungarian dignitaries, and promised the Székelys that they could keep their privileges, and with these he managed to attain internal support.
In 1606 the Porte obliged him to hand over the fortress of Lippa, but as the warriors in the fortress did not want to give up, he himself fought in the battle and handed the fortress over to the Turks.
He gained the trust and continuous support of the Porte through this action, and thus he gained greater independence to carry out his goals.
He gradually managed to stabilise his central, absolutistic power.
He excluded parliament from power, and called the meeting of Transylvanian lords ever less frequently and in smaller and smaller numbers.
He made his decisions in important matters alone and strictly controlled the financial, military and political affairs of the country.
Bethlen in the Thirty Years' war
In 1619 Bethlen joined the anti-Habsburg revolt of the Czech orders with his army of 18,000.
He did not miss the chance to unite Transylvania with Royal Hungary.
Marching through Upper Hungary he gained the support of the Hungarian orders, conquering Érsekújvár and Pozsony.
The Besztercebánya parliament chose him Hungarian king in 1620, but he did not want to be crowned.
After the defeat of the Czechs at Fehérhegy at the end of 1620 his earlier supporters, the Royal Hungarian orders, turned against him. They were frightened by Bethlen's strict policy and a possible Turkish protectorate, which could have been established under his reign.
Owing to his victories in 1621, he signed the Nicolsburg peace treaty at the end of the year, which expanded the territory of Transylvania.
After this he launched a military campaign against Royal Hungary twice (1623-24, 1626), but the Hungarian lords did not support him any more.
It's to Bethlen's credit that Transylvania was able to join the community of European Protestant states, which considered this small state a significant military and political force during the Thirty Years' war.
Principal György Rákóczi I (1630-1648)
After Bethlen's death his second wife, Katharine of Brandenburg ruled the country for a while (1629-1630). The principal appointed her as his successor in his will.
However, the Transylvanian orders were rather hostile to her and soon forced her to abdicate.
György Rákóczi I became the principal of Transylvania, and his reign brought calm, peaceful and fruitful time.
In 1631 he made an agreement with Hungarian King, Ferdinand II to maintain peace.
He increased his private estates as well as those of the treasury. He defeated his inner opponents in lawsuits of possession and confiscation of property.
In 1643 - after a long wait - he joined the Swedish-French alliance and entered the Thirty Years' war in the defense of free religion.
In 1644 he occupied Kassa, but after the Swedish allies could not support him because of an attack by Denmark he suffered a defeat at Galgóca and had to give up the whole of Northern Hungary (Felvidék).
In December 1645 he signed the Linz peace treaty with Ferdinand III, according to which seven Hungarian counties were annexed to the territory of Transylvania.
At the same time the treaty guaranteed for the Hungarian orders the maintenance of the 1606 Vienna peace.
Military-like net of settlements
After 1606 there was another peaceful period of about 50 years on the Hungarian battlefield of the Habsburg empire.
Thus the Military Council - which sought to maintain peace at any cost - decreased the number of soldiers from 20-22,000 to 16-17,000 so that they could spend the saved soldiers' pay on the Thirty Years' war.
Yet during the peaceful years Turkish attacks were quite the norm and the campaigns of Transylvanian principals turned the country into a battlefield several times.
The population of the front line was forced into self-defense as those 5-6,000 dismissed border fortress soldiers had to be replaced somehow.
The solution to this problem was to militarise the settlements along the border.
Market towns were surrounded by fortification, the churches of the villages were used as watch-towers, while the civil population took on military duties for nearby landlords in return for certain privileges.
Besides the population of the front line settlements, important landlords joined the fight against Turkish plunderers with their private armies.
The difficulties of controlling the surrendered territories in the 17th century
The major economic and political crisis at the end of the 16th century changed the relationship of the center and the provinces.
While earlier the sultan's court made all decisions, in the 17th century it passed more and more things over to local authorities.
The most important changes took place in the field of finance: several taxes were introduced, while regular sandjak registrations and payments granted on the basis of these were stopped, instead of which the owners of certain offices (such as fortress soldiers) themselves took over the collection their due incomes.
As the center gave up control of the timár-system, redistributing the estates, a significant number of these became inheritable.
Because of the decline of the spahi army the military and administrative role of sandjaks and vilayets was continuously decreasing.
The begler beghs were able to set up their private armies from their bigger incomes even in times of inflation. With these private armies they were able to support the state more efficiently in foreign wars, maintaining public security and collecting state taxes.
This is the explanation of the fact that in the second half of the 17th century the Turks organised vilayets without sandjaks in the conquered Hungarian lands.
Besides the ones in Buda and Temesvár they set up new ones in Eger (1596), Kanizsa (1600), Várad (1660) and Újvár (1663).
The Osman-Turkish state before and during the Köprülüs
In the first half of the 17th century the power of sultans decreased.
The costly Hungarian, Persian, Polish and Cretan wars had exhausted the treasury.
The unpaid soldiers, impoverished spahis and rajas were collected by revolting pashas, who took control of whole provinces in Anatolia and Syria.
There was a complete chaos in governing.
Instead of the padishah, who had previously been omnipotent, the women of the harem and their allies, the yanichar chief officers made the decisions.
Chief commanders were replaced quite frequently and it was impossible to put an end to the repeated revolts of the yanichars.
In June 1656 the Sultan Mother appointed Mehmed Köprülü (around 1575-1661) as chief commander, who was in his eighties at that time.
A period of cruel terror (according to barely believable estimates he had 30,000 people killed in the first year of his reign alone), economising and a battle against corruption started.
The organising work of the powerful chief commander's son made the state an active empire again.
His son, Ahmed Körpülü (1635-1676), who ruled between 1661-1676, continued his father's policy, although with less cruel methods.
The Osman troops launched their attacks against Venice, Hungary, Poland and Russia, one after the other.
György Rákóczi II, the loser of peace (1648-1660)
György Rákóczi II was already brought up as a principal by his parents, but his unreasonable and irresponsible measures almost destroyed the country.
He tightened his relationship with the Rumanian voivode districts; he entered some wars of power on the side of new voivodes several times, when in 1655 Moldavia became the vassal state of Transylvania.
In 1656 he formed an alliance with the Swedish king, Charles X to divide Poland and his plan was also supported by two Rumanian principals and a Cossack hetman, Hmelnitski.
He was interested in a possible western European anti-Habsburg alliance, too, while at the same time he was trying to find Hungarian supporters.
His younger brother, Zsigmond, had connections with Pál Pálffy and Miklós Zrínyi from Royal Hungary, who wanted to choose György Rákóczi as the new king.
Without the permission of the Porta he launched an attack against Poland in 1657 with an army of 15,000.
His Swedish ally promised that György could gain the Polish crown but he soon let down the people of Transylvania, who suffered several defeats.
At that time the main Transylvanian army fell into the hands of the Tartars at Kalmenice.
Rákóczi was able to escape with about 300 people leaving his soldiers behind. He left for his home, Transylvania.
Transylvania - on the edge of destruction
In 1657 the whole Transylvanian army was captured by the Crimean Tartars. Although he promised to do so, Rákóczi did not offer to bail out his soldiers from imprisonment at his own expense.
A letter arrived from the Porte in which he was asked to abdicate. Even though the orders chose Ferenc Rhédey as principal (1657), Rákóczi did not abdicate.
In 1658 Mehmed Köprülü, the new chief commander flew into a rage and came to teach his vassal state a lesson.
The Turkish-Tartar troops occupied Gyulafehérvár, Torda, Kolozsvár and the whole of Transylvania.
At that time the Transylvanian parliament chose Ákos Bacsai as principal (1658-1660), who had an agreement with the Turks; he gave up Lugos and Karánsebes and accepted that the annual tax of the country would be increased to 40,000 Forints; nevertheless he managed to have Köprülü's troops leave the country.
In 1659 a civil war broke out between the followers of Rákóczi and Barcsai, and János Kemény, who in the meanwhile returned home from Tartar imprisonment, also declared his claims for the throne.
Pasha of Buda, Ahmed Sejdi also joined this fight.
In 1660 he triumphed over Rákóczi at Szászfenes, who died in his injuries gained in this battle.
But the campaign of revenge against Transylvania was not yet finished. Under the leadership of Pasha Ali in August 1660 the Turks occupied St Ladislaus's town, the gate and the biggest fortress of Transylvania, Várad.
A new Turkish war after half a century of peace (1663-1664)
After a long period of peace Turkish troops attacked Royal Hungary again in 1663.
The reason for the armed conflict was that György Rákóczi, Transylvanian principal (1648-1660) launched a military campaign against Poland without permission (1657).
The revenge of the Turks was the occupation of Várad in 1660, and the response from the Military Council was to send troops to the principality.
The armed fight of the two empires had been unavoidable sooner or later.
The army led by chief commander, Ahmed Köprülü, captured another very important fortress in 1663 (Érsekújvár).
At the beginning of 1664, however, the Hungarian-Croatian-German troops commanded by Miklós Zrínyi and count Julius Hohenlohe won a victory over the "eternal enemy" after half a century of failure.
In the winter campaign they took back several smaller fortresses as they pushed forward deeply into the conquered territories, then their actions were followed by the burning down of the bridge of Eszék.
Although the chief commander's counter-attack freed the fortress of Kanizsa, which was under siege by the Christians, and he took over Új-Zrínyivár, on 1st August he suffered a defeat at Szentgotthárd at the hands of the imperial forces led by Raimundo Montecuccoli.
As a result of these victories Europe again turned attention to the Hungarian battlefield.
Searching for the way out: the Wesselényi plot
In spite of Christian success the Vasvár peace, which was more favourable for the Turks, was received with great dissatisfaction.
The Hungarian lords could hardly accept that in spite of the victory at Szentgotthárd the Viennese court agreed to the fact that the losing party could keep its conquered towns, Várad and Érsekújvár.
They looked for an ally: first at Lipot I's main rival, the French king, Louis XIV (1643-1715), then in the autumn of 1666 at the Turks, under the leadership of palatine Ferenc Wesselényi.
For guaranteeing the privileges of the orders and the free choice of worship they were ready to accept a 10-50,000 golden Forints annual tax and the sovereignty of the sultan.
This would have meant the birth of a Turkish vassal state, similar to Transylvania, although this one would have been in a better position.
But the plot failed while it was still just a plan, similarly to Peter Zrínyi's and Ferenc Rákóczi's relevant movements in 1670.
Zrínyi, Ferenc Frangepán, Ferenc Nádasdy and Ferenc Bónis were executed.
Vienna took advantage of the chance to control the rights of the orders and free choice of worship with the tool of absolutism.
Searching for the way out: the movement of the hiders and Imre Thököly's kingdom
The revenge on Hungary did not bring the desired results for Vienna.
The Gubernium had to be distributed soon, the taxation system failed because of the resistance of the nobility and villeins, and the fact that Protestant preachers were sent to be gally-slaves increased the tension.
Organising the border fortress soldiers into a regular body, that is as permanent units took place at the worst possible time.
The people who escaped to Transylvania and the Partium organised armed actions as a reply to the Viennese measure from 1672 on.
Their movement almost failed when in 1678 a new commander, Imre Thököly was appointed.
The Kuruc leader's military success forced king Lipot I (1657-1705) to make an agreement with the orders at the 1681 Sopron parliament.
In 1682 Thököly occupied Kassa with the support of the Pasha of Buda, then in return for a 20,000 golden Forints tax he acknowledged the sovereignty of the Porte.
In the territory of Hungary a new state came into being for a short time: Imre Thököly's northern Hungarian principality (1682-1685), which was also a Turkish vassal state.
Turkish orientation in Hungarian politics in the 16-17th centuries
Hungarian politicians firmly refused any kind of cooperation with the Turks till 1526.
But the defeat at Mohács changed the universal anti-Turkish feelings and the forces gathering around King János Szapolyai believed that accepting dependence on the Turks would save the country from disintegration.
The occupation of Buda in 1541 demolished this illusion.
By the 1570s, however, another "Turkish" conception was worked out, which was put into practice by the 17th century fights of the orders: the Hungarian nobility objected to Habsburg centralisation and counter-reformation, acquiring support from the Transylvanian principality (and actually the Turks).
Meanwhile they did not even think of a complete surrender to the Osman empire as everybody knew it would bring about the downfall of the country.
But there was no other choice left, since Hungary did not take advantage of the "prosperity" of the 1660s and the aggressiveness of the Viennese government.
Turkish orientation was the strongest during the Thököly revolt, when the country was divided into four parts (not just three) and when the countries of Europe united against the Turks.
So in the 1683 war the majority of Hungarians were on the side of their "ancient enemy".
Mihály Apafi's principality (1661-1690)
During his short reign, János Kemény (1661-1662) hoped for and sought Lipot I's support in the struggle against the Turks. But Lipot I let him down: they chose Mihály Apafi as their ruler (1661), who was appointed by the Transylvanians and the Porte.
Kemény died in January 1662, in battle with the Turks, who supported Apafi.
Apafi had a very difficult task, but he did his best: he stabilised the government of the country successfully, showed loyalty towards the Porte, while searching for connections with the group of orders led by Zrínyi and Miklós Wesselényi.
The Vasvár peace, which put an end to the 1663-1664 Turkish campaign, had a part which concerned Transylvania: Turkish sovereignty was acknowledged and Várad was left in the hands of the Turks.
In the 1660-170s Apafi tried to preserve the independence of Transylvania both at the Porte and in Vienna. In the meanwhile he intended to form links with western Protestant countries.
In 1667 he made an anti-Habsburg alliance with French king, Louis XIV.
In 1684 the Saint League was formed, which liberated Hungary, and at that time Apafi tried to bring Transylvania into the Polish-French sphere of interest and save the independence of the principality for the future, when the Turks would leave the region.
The war of reoccupation against the Turks
In 1683 chief commander Mustapha Kara was the last one to lead the army of the Osman empire against the imperial town after the Polish-Russian wars.
The unsuccessful campaign against Vienna and the victory of the imperial-Polish army at Kahlenberg was the overture of a new war in Hungary.
In spring 1684 under the protection of Pope Ince XI (1676-1689) the Saint League was formed, which united the military-financial resources of Central European states against the Turks.
This union was a great success until 1689.
In the first phase of the war (1683-1686) the imperial army recaptured the fortresses of Esztergom, Érsekújvár, Szolnok and finally the previous capital of the country: Buda (1686).
The second phase of the war (1686-1689) brought new victories, and the capture of Belgrade (1688).
However, the increasing power of the Habsburgs was against the interest of the great western rival, the French king, Louis XIV, who withdrew from the armistice in the autumn of 1688, which had been signed four years earlier, and launched an attack against the province of Pfalz.
From this time on the Habsburg empire was forced into a war on two fronts.
In spite of the difficult situation of the empire the Osman army was not strong enough to fight back in the third, longer phase of the war (1689-1697).
Although they managed to take over Belgrade in 1690, in the following years strategically important Hungarian fortresses, which were under blockade (Kanizsa, Várad, Gyula), were occupied by the Christian army one after the other.
The 1697 victory at Zenta brought the end of the war closer.
After the peace of Karlóca in 1699 the country was liberated, with the exception of the Temesköz.
The success of the Christian army was attributed to the formation of the alliance against the Turks, the establishment of the permanent imperial army and the development of military technology and logistics.
Owing to these facts the imperial army was able to supply bigger military units in several battlefields and prove its military advantage and finally defeat the still powerful "eternal enemy".
As a consequence of the annual march of the big armies and their ravaging of certain territories of the liberated country both the population and the net of settlements were destroyed forever.
The fall of the Transylvanian principality
The war of liberation reached Transylvania in 1687.
The troops of chief commander Charles of Lotharingia marched into the principality and the Balázsfalva treaty was signed, according to which Transylvania would supply the chief commander's soldiers with food and fodder, in return he guaranteed the independence of Transylvania.
Vienna, however, did not accept this agreement and sent General Antonio Caraffa to Transylvania, who made the local orders sign the Fogaras declaration in 1688.
In this document the people of Transylvania accepted the sovereignty of the Crown and they agreed that imperial soldiers would be sent to Transylvanian fortresses and were obliged to pay a 700,000 Forints annual tax.
Not long after this Mihály Apafi, who foresaw the fall of the country, died in 1690.
The Porta appointed Imre Thököly principal, who managed to defeat imperial General Donatus Heissler in 1690 in a difficult battle at Zernyest, near the Tölcsvár pass. After his triumph the Transylvanian orders chose him as principal, too.
The imperial forces led by Lajos Badeni soon forced Thököly out of Transylvania, to which he never returned.
From this time on Transylvania unquestionably came under the rule of the Habsburgs.
The Diploma Leopoldinum
The new situation of Transylvania in the Habsburg empire was regulated by the diploma issued by Lipot I in 1690, which was later modified and accepted in 1691.
The text was compiled by a group led by Miklós Bethlen, who was sent to Vienna from Transylvania.
This document settled civil government in Transylvania by establishing a council of government, a Gebernium, the residence of which was in Nagyszeben.
The governor was György Bánffy, his chancellor was Miklós Bethlen , the treasurer was János Haller and the general-in-chief was Gergely Bethlen.
Lipot I guaranteed the keeping of Transylvanian laws and free choice of worship and set the annual tax at 100,000 golden Forints.
The Diploma considered Transylvania an independent province and part of the Hungarian Crown, annexed to the empire.
The Transylvanian people were to have Mihály Apafi II's principality acknowledged, but after the reoccupation of Várad (1692) they had him interned to Vienna, then he made him abdicate from the title principal (1701).
Plans for reorganising the country
After the recapture of Buda in 1686 the most important question was how to reorganise the country peacefully.
The goals aimed for the Hungarian orders and the court were quite different.
The orders wanted to regain their earlier leading role within the new circumstances.
According to the suggestion of Archbishop Lipot Kollonich, who represented the interests of the Viennese court, the positions at the court in military, foreign and financial affairs attained during the 16-17th centuries should not have been limited at all.
Vienna seemed to be stronger.
Although they could not prevent reorganising the castle district system, they set up the Neoacquistica Commissio, with the help of which they were able to influence the development of different regions in the country according to their own interests.
Moreover, in the southern border region the Military Council established a border-watch system with the cooperation of the Serbs who had fled to Hungary, which guaranteed the defense of Hungary and the Habsburg empire against the Osmans for a long time.
The consequences of Turkish reign
During the 16-17th centuries Hungary was one of the most important battlefields in the conflict between the Christian and the Muslim world.
The constant warfare between the Habsburg and the Osman empires, and 150 years of foreign occupation inflicted a lot of damage to the country in terms of human life, means of production and material possessions.
The irreversible damage was the most significant in demography and ethnography.
The increase of the population in the early modern age had not missed Hungary, but it was reversed by long periods of war, first of all the 15-year war and the war of reoccupation against the Turks.
As the troops and raiders pushed forward along river valleys, damage was the greatest in these areas, and the Hungarian population there was replaced by Serb, Croatian, Slovakian and Rumanian people.
As a result of this by the end of the 17th century the ethnic map of the country became similar to the one at the beginning of the 20th century, before Trianon.
There was a major damage to the net of settlements, towns and monasteries.
In certain conquered areas more than half of the population had been killed, while almost all the monasteries - medieval centers of knowledge and education - were pulled down.
The hierarchical order of the net of towns was also broken, since three previous regional centers (Buda, Szeged and Pécs) had become Turkish fortresses, and their populations had fled.
Thus the basis of economy became market towns, which prospered in cattle trade.
This shows what kind of damage the Turkish reign had inflicted in earlier economic relations.
That is agriculture remained the main branch of industry, and in the fields of industrialisation and the development in bourgeois mentality Hungary's backwardness compared to more developed European territories was further increasing.
In spite of these facts Hungary, which was divided into three parts, was able to preserve its independence and status as a state.
Owing to the border defense system financed by Habsburg provinces the Hungarian Kingdom was able to avoid Turkish occupation and the sad consequences of that. The countries south of Hungary on the Balkans had to suffer a lot because of the Osman occupation.
GOVERNMENT
Viennese central offices
The central governing of the countries of the Habsburg empire was the responsibility of Viennese central offices.
The most important one was the Secret Council (Geheimer Rat), where the emperor's counselors discussed the most essential domestic and foreign matters concerning the empire.
Another advisory board with more members was the Court Council (Hofrat), which became less important in the 17th century, and its activity was limited to justice.
The control of economic life and financial matters of the empire was the duty of the Court Chamber (Hofkammer), which also controlled the chambers of other countries.
Decisions, the orders and measures of the emperor were written down by the Court Chancellery (hofkanzlei).
Certain divisions of the chancellery became independent in the 17h century.
In 1556 the Court Military Council (Hofkriegsrat) was formed to organise the defense system against Turkish attacks and control military affairs, and its authority spread over to the whole empire.
Ferdinand I's reform of the government: the governor's council
When in 1526 Ferdinand Habsburg became Hungarian king, it meant that a part of Hungary joined a more developed empire as far as the methods of government were concerned.
Consequently these methods were also introduced in Hungary, and leaving medieval methods of governing behind, now modern organs of government were formed.
King Ferdinand's first step was to set up a governing body to lead the country - as he himself kept his residence outside the country - and function as a central organ of government.
The governor's council was formed in the 1540s during Archbishop of Esztergom, Pál Várady's governorship, and its members were lords and prelates who were also members of the emperor's Hungarian Council.
The governor had similar rights as the palatine, but he did not have any power in financial and military affairs.
From the end of the 16th century the office of the governor was associated with the office of the palatine, and as an independent office it lost its significance, since the advisory board of counselors did not function and satisfy Ferdinand's demands.
In the following centuries palatines bore the title of governor as well.
The organs of central finance: the chambers
The Hungarian Chamber was founded in 1528 by King Ferdinand I to control finance centrally. This chamber fled from Buda to Pozsony and started to function there in 1531.
The task of the chamber was to supervise and administer the total income of the treasury as a body of government (incorporating a board of advisors) in the countries of the Hungarian Crown.
It had to concentrate on regaining the estates taken from the Crown, to supervise and administer the collection of taxes, regal incomes including thirtieth customs duties.
The Hungarian Chamber was officially responsible to the king alone, but actually it came under the authority of the Court Chamber.
With the residence of Kassa the Szepes Chamber was set up in 1567 for Northern Hungary, which was far away from Pozsony but significant from the point of view of economics. The Szepes Chamber was under the authority of the Pozsony Chamber but in reality it was quite independent.
In the eastern regions of the country the Szepes Chamber conducted not only financial affairs but also other administrative and military duties.
The Hungarian Council and the Hungarian Chancellery
Besides the governor's council, which functioned as a government, the Hungarian Council became the successor of the medieval royal council advising the Habsburg rulers. The members of this council were appointed by the king.
In the 17th century the number of advisors was increasing, whereas their role and influence was decreasing.
The Hungarian Council had meetings unsystematically during the sessions of parliament, when the lords were together anyway, and could not really reach unanimous decisions.
The kings did not listen to these Hungarian advisors, so the orders at the meetings of the parliament always complained about the fact that in Hungarian matters the king should decide with the help of Hungarian advisors.
King Ferdinand and later Habsburg rulers neglected the Hungarian Chancellery in the same way.
Although it was formally functioning under the leadership of the Archbishop of Esztergom in power, who was the chief chancellor as well, but in practice one of the departments of the Court Chancellery gave the orders, letters of command and measures in the name of the Hungarian king.
Supreme jurisdiction
There were changes in supreme jurisdiction after the defeat at Mohács.
The king's personal judgement was stopped, thus the significance of supreme court jurisdiction decreased.
At the High Court of Justice the king was replaced by a person, who became the president of the Royal Board.
The practice of palatine jurisdiction did not change, and its importance increased at the end of the 17th century, later turning into the Board of Seven.
The civil lawsuits of the nobility and priests were able to appeal to the supreme court.
The cases of disloyalty towards the king and the Crown were discussed at the meetings of parliament.
The courts of the Supreme Court functioned in the 40-day law sessions in spring and autumn.
Because of wars and marches this kind of jurisdiction could barely function, so other, not always legal forms of jurisdiction became popular.
One of these was the appearance of travelling judging masters of senior judges: they travelled from town to town and passed judgements in the cases of people who turned to them.
Smaller forms of jurisdiction
In market towns and villages the judge of the settlement could pass sentences in cases of smaller importance, in other cases it was the authority of the landlord, that is, inhabitants had to turn to the lord's chair.
These chairs were quite popular in the 16-17th centuries, the presidents of which were not the landlords themselves, but another invited aristocrat.
The members of the chairs were the landlord's employees and office holders invited from other castle districts.
In civil, socage and criminal lawsuits the landlord's chair had unlimited authority, without the chance of appeal.
In special cases - usually treason or disloyalty - the king in power sent a special court.
Such a court passed sentences upon the Hungarian aristocrats, for example István Illésházy and István Bocskai before the Bocskai movement, when the sentence was made before, without the chance of appeal.
In Transylvanian Saxon and Székely chairs kings made judgements together with chosen chair judges, then in the 16-17th centuries Transylvanian principals sent royal judges, who represented the interests of royal power.
Local governments: castle districts
During the 16-17th centuries castle districts became more and more powerful as the central government could not interfere with their inner affairs except for collecting tax.
The most important forum of local noblemen was the noblemen's meeting, where decisions were reached in public matters and administration.
Parliament ministers and the most influential office holders were chosen here: the vice ispán (vice bailiff), magistrates and members of the jury.
The chief ispán (bailiff) of the castle district did not usually stay in his castle district.
At these castle district meetings regulations and statutes were compiled which regulated life in the given district.
The most significant juristic organ of the castle district was the castle district court, and one could apply to the royal supreme court in civil lawsuits.
At the castle district court the chairman was the vice ispán, members of the jury took part in passing the sentence.
Keeping written records, the minutes of meetings, and composing letters were the clerk's duty, who was usually a learned man with a good command of the Latin language.
Privileged areas, peasant castle districts
The people living in the region of Jász-kun were organised into chairs, the central organ of their local government was the unity of Jász-s and Kuns.
The main authority and chief judge had been the palatine since 1485.
This area fell into the hands of the Turks in the 16-17th centuries, but certain parts were annexed to Hungarian border fortresses.
The hajdú district contained the settlements of hajdús, who were settled there after the Bocskai movement.
Their main authority was the king, in the name of whom the captain-in-chief of Hungary took his orders.
Some of the hajdú settlements became towns, which kept their independence, others joined the county system as villages.
In the Great Plain peasant castle districts were formed in the 17th century, as self-defense organisations of neighbouring villages.
Their goal was to defend themselves from criminals. They had their own meetings, where lieutenants and leaders were elected.
The zapises in Northern Hungary - self-defense organisations of noblemen - were set up with the same aim.
National honours
There were no central bodies of government of the Hungarian orders in the 16-17th centuries, but they individually took part in the work of government organisations and their interests were represented by the leading dignitaries of the country.
The deputy of the king was the palatine, the first honour of the orders since the Middle Ages.
The responsibilities of the palatine were defined in the 1486 palatine acts: he substituted the ruler in his absence, and had the power to judge, he was the chief commander of the armies of the country after the king, and could give away estates as large as 32 villein lands, and he was the chief judge of the Jasz and Kun people.
From 1608 the parliament elected the palatine from among two Catholic and two Protestant aristocratic candidates.
The judge royal's duty was to take part in the work of the supreme court as one of the chief judges.
The role of the honour of the Croatian-Slavonian ban was limited, in this period their main duty was to judge.
The 'master tabernacules' and 'master personales' were judges at court of appeals in towns.
Free royal towns
The most significant Hungarian towns were the free royal towns.
These were walled towns and they came under the direct authority of the king, from whom they got their privileges.
Part of these privileges included autonomous local government, others were economical privileges.
These latter ones were important, they paid tax to the treasury in a lump sum, they had staple right and were exempted from paying customs duty.
There were two big groups of towns in Hungary: towns which applied the Buda laws, which were 'civitas tabernacules' and they could appeal from their own court to the chair of the 'master tabernacules' (for example, Buda, Pest, Nagyszombat, Pozsony, Sopron, Kassa, Bártfa and Eperjes); and towns which applied the Székesfehérvár laws, which were 'civitas personales', they could appeal to the chair of the 'master personales' (for example, Székesfehérvár, Esztergom, Lõcse).
Free royal towns represented themselves at the meetings of parliament through their ministers.
Thus the number of privileged towns increased in the 17th century, although the orders tended to prevent the king from presenting privileges to market towns.
Mining towns
Another significant group of towns were the mining towns, which were located in mountaneous areas containing ores.
Miners had already received privileges from the king during the Middle Ages, and had their own special laws. From 1466 Lower Hungarian mining towns near the river Garam formed their own group with the center of Körmöcbánya. They lived according to the Selmec laws. The towns in this group were Besztercebánya, Selmecbánya, Libetbánya, Bakabánya, Újbánya.
Their alliance lasted till 1863.
Northern Hungarian mining towns were unified in 1487 to administer their mining matters and lawsuits jointly. (Their center was Gölnicbánya, but Szomolnokbánya, Rudabánya, Jászó, Telkibánya, Rozsnyóbánya and Igló also belonged here.)
Their unity was broken by the end of the 16th century, when towns fell under the authority of landlords.
There were outstanding mining towns in Szatmár as well, such as Nagybánya, Felsõbánya and Kapnikbánya, which were later annexed to Transylvania.
In the Transylvanian mountains the most significant towns were Abrudbánya, Offenbánya, Kisbánya and Zalatna, where gold was to be found.
The government of the Transylvanian principality
The methods of the government of the Transylvanian principality were quite similar to those of the medieval Hungarian Kingdom.
Besides the principal there was the principal's council, but the members of the council had the right only to form an opinion, and the principal was not obliged to accept this.
Laws were compiled at special meetings of parliament, where the principal's interests dominated.
The only executive board of the principality was the chancellery founded in 1556 by Mihály Csáky along medieval patterns.
The bigger chancellery was responsible for foreign and domestic matters, that is, it gave orders and instructions in the name of the principal, whereas the smaller chancellery was in charge of writing down the sentences passed at the principal's court and administering juristic matters outside lawsuits.
Besides these the affairs in higher government were dealt with chief office holders, who were the familiars of the principal (for example, the chief tax collector supervised the collection of taxes and tithe rents, the captain-in-chief was the military leader of Transylvanian troops after the principal).
Local governments of the Transylvanian principality: the chairs
Chairs were organs of local government similar to castle districts, which had juristic and administrative functions.
In Transylvania the Saxon land or Royal land were divided into chairs, which derived their names from the central town (Szeben, Szászsebes, Segesvár, Medgyes, Újegyház, Szerdahely, Szászváros, Nagysink, Kõhalom).
Besides the chairs Saxon people lived in the district of Brasso and Beszterce.
At the head of the Saxon unity was the count since the public juristic unity of the Saxons was formed in 1486. The post of the count was filled in by the mayor of the most important town, Nagyszeben.
The Székelys also lived in chair districts, their center was Udvarhelyszék (the others were Aranyosszék, Marosszék, Csíkszék, Sepsiszék, Kézdiszék and Orbaiszék; the last three were called Háromszék [Threechairs] from the 17th century).
At the head of the Székelys there was the Székely ispán (bailiff), the honour of which was held by Transylvanian principals in the 16-17th centuries.
The government of the Turkish province
There were three main responsibilities of Turkish public administration in Hungary: 1. serving the army; 2. collecting tax and administering estates; 3. juristic service.
The administration, military organisation and finance of the conquered regions in the 16th century were primarily based on the net of sandjaks, in Arabic livas.
The population was registered according to sandjaks and so were the production capacity calculated, taxes imposed and service estates, the timars, distributed.
At the head of the sandjak was the sandjak begh (mir-i liva), who was the commander of the landowner spahis in the province, but he was also responsible for civil administration, public order and economic life.
He had to report to the begler begh (mir-i miran), who supervised the highest organisational unit of the province, the vilayet, which incorporated the sandjaks. Vilayets were also called begler begh's districts.
Till the 15-year war there were two vilayet in the territory of Hungary: the Buda vilayet (1541), containing 15 sandjaks along the rivers Danube and Drava, and the Temesvár vilayet(1552), with 6 sandjaks.
From among the two begler beghs the Buda one was in a higher position. The owners of these honours received the office of the commander from 1623 on.
The owners of important honours often changed; in the 16th century a begler begh could spend one and a half, a sandjak begh two years in their positions on average.
The financial matters and administration of the estates of the Turkish provinces were controlled by the defterdars in the vilayet centers.
The sandjaks made different listings (defters) from time to time.
The so-called 'detailed defter' contained the provincial law books recording the regulations of taxation (kanunname), the register and list of tax-payers of the population of towns and villages and the calculated revenues of the state and private landlords (for example, the sum of the jizye, the product tithes, rent fees, customs duties and incomes of mills and fish ponds... etc.).
The so-called 'comprehensive' or 'timar-defter' registered those landowners who had some of the incomes mentioned in the detailed defter.
The most prosperous settlements and the main sources of cash belonged the direct authority of the treasury (in the form of imperial has estates), others were in the possession of office holders and soldiers as has-, timar- or ziamet estates.
Soldiers' pay and the number of fortress watches were recorded every quarter in the soldiers' pay lists.
The key figure of Turkish public administration, the kadhi, was originally a judge.
But in the Osman empire he became the main figure of state organisation, appointed by the emperor's council.
Although the borders of juristic districts (kazas) and sandjaks were almost the same in Hungary, the number of kadhi districts outnumbered those of the sandjaks: there being about 50 of them.
In his own district the kadhi passed sentences in the cases of family and criminal law according to Muslim religious law (in principle quite independently).
Besides these he had numerous administrative duties: he accredited financial invoices, he collected the so-called extraordinary taxes; supervised the mobilisation of the army, and was responsible for organising food delivery; he also supervised the work of foundations and guilds, together with the market inspector he set and checked the prices and the markets; registered estates and took steps in cases of bequest; he was the local ears and eyes of the central government, that is he regularly reported to the Porta on public feelings and the acts of dignitaries.
As the Hungarian population avoided Turkish courts, the kadhis here dealt o only with military and financial matters.
SOCIAL HISTORY
The leading strata of the country: landowner aristocrats
The political, military and financial leading strata of Hungary in the Turkish age were the group of aristocrats.
Members of this group were those noblemen who were invited to meetings of parliament through a special invitation card from the king.
Barons, counts and dukes, who inherited their titles thanks to the Habsburg rulers' donations, were also included in the group. These people and the prelates of the country were called tycoons.
The most important honours of the orders (for example, the office of the palatine, royal judge) and military offices (captains-in-chief) were held by them.
This meant that they were in control of the domestic and juristic matters of the country, but they also played an important role in the local conduct of military and financial matters.
The basis of their power was their possessions in the form of estates, cash and jewelry. They usually increased their possessions by successful marriages and their connections or they could receive further donations from rulers for their services.
They did not have a close ties with the Austrian-German aristocracy, and actually they preferred to stay in their own castles to staying in the court of the Habsburg kings in Vienna.
Those who made a great career were usually educated at the court or had close connections with it (e.g., Tamás Nádasdy, Miklós Pálffy, Miklós and Pál Eszterházy).
The diversity of common noblemen
Although each and every noble person had the same privileges in Hungary in the Turkish age, common noblemen were separated from the aristocracy.
Common noblemen were not homogenous.
The richest common noblemen were landowners - the majority of them owning one or more villages - who were often in the service of a big landowner aristocrat as his familiare.
They formed the leading strata of politicians in the castle districts, who participated in the work of parliament through their representatives in the house of commons.
Besides the smaller landowners there were those who lived like villeins, indeed, they had to pay tax (taksa) to the landlord and the ruler.
Their noble origins were proved by their letter of nobility (armalis).
Conflicts with the Turks offered a chance to a lot of border fortress soldiers to join the group of noblemen as acknowledgement of their services.
From the 17th century on, however, rich peasants could achieve - with the mediation of their landlords - membership of the nobility with the help of their money. They took all possible advantage of this situation.
The birth of a new social group along the border: border fortress soldiers
Due to Turkish occupation a new group was formed in Hungarian society by the second half of the 16th century: the group of border fortress soldiers. They were also called "warrior people / order" at that time.
The independence of those 20,000 soldiers, who were on permanent duty along the border was the result of the privileges (exemption from paying tax and the juristic authority of the landlord, independent military jurisdiction, freedom of worship) which had previously been the exclusive privilege of the nobility.
Since the people of the 'warrior order' were villeins and small landowners who lost their properties, their officers were common noblemen, their leaders were aristocrats, thus joining this group was the best opportunity to work one's way up.
Owing to the fact that the dominant part of the border defense army was light cavalry, their way of life was quite different from that of the permanent army formed at the end of the 17th century. The border defense army made a perfect job until its liquidation.
Because of their privileges and components it was a transitional strata in Hungarian society between the nobility and villeins - although closer to the nobility.
Hajdús and peasant soldiers in Hungary in the 17th century
After the 15-year war the number of hajdús increased significantly compared to previous centuries.
Originally they were cowherds, but in this period this social group had several sub-groups.
Royal or registered hajdús served in border fortresses receiving their pays from the ruler.
The free hajdús served there too, but their pay was the goods they received in the course of plunders. If it was not enough, they attacked villeins.
Those 10,000 hajdús who had been settled by Bocskai in old hajdú towns in 1605-1606 with collective privileges formed a separate group.
In the counties of Szabolcs and Bihar along the rivers Sajó and Hernád Principals Bocskai's successors continued settling hajdús, while in Transdanubia and Northern Hungary powerful landowners (the Batthyánys, the Eszterházys, the Nádasdys) gave different privileges to their hajdús.
The Zrínyi family's peasant soldiers in the Muraköz received similar privileges in return for their service. These soldiers lived half a soldier's, half a civil life in their fortified settlements.
Burgers of towns in the shadow of Turkish occupation
Peculiar opportunities of the Turkish occupation and Hungarian economy hindered the development of a bourgeoisie, which in any case was in a handicapped situation.
When the country was divided into three parts several royal towns fell under Turkish authority, which further retarded the development of the net of towns.
Neither was undeveloped industry was favourable for the enrichment of burgers. The settling of noblemen and soldiers in towns limited their previous positions.
In a paradoxical way city burgers found the way to accumulate capital by joining the cattle- and wine trade and wine growing - instead of starting ventures in industry.
They did not invest their money in establishing means of manufacturing, but in buying lands and vine-yards, which was also advantageous for their ventures in trade.
Despite the negative factors they were able to keep their privileges.
The most numerous social strata: the villeins
Although the Hungarian nobility was the most populous after that of the Polish in Europe, the most numerous social strata of the country was that of the villeins, who did not enjoy any privileges.
Similarly to their lords this strata was not homogenous either.
Even though there were several experiments to bind them to the soil during the 16-17th centuries, these were not successful.
Their freedom of movement was encouraged by the fact that there was a need for new border fortress soldiers and hajdús, and landlords themselves wanted to repopulate their deserted estates.
Fleeing villeins could choose either way, they joined a group with privileges, that is, they could make their way up.
Where the power of the landlord was greater, villeins had to pay a lot of tax and do robot.
At the same time rich peasants or the zsellérs who were engaged in animal husbandry, wine-growing, handicraft industry or trade had a higher standard of living than noblemen, moreover, in the 17th century they could even a buy a letter patents of nobility.
Peasants and peasant burgers during the Turkish occupation
After the Turkish occupation more and more village peasants and peasant burgers from market towns joined the prospering cattle husbandry and cattle trade towards the west.
The peculiar development of the Hungarian economy in the 16-17th centuries was favourable for those farmers engaged in animal husbandry and tõzsérs.
Peasant burgers took advantage of the only chance for economic survival by being tõzsérs, moreover, in the 16th century their activity brought material wealth for towns in occupied areas.
Thanks to their wealth, they had an influential role in local administration and local government, since during the Turkish occupation the majority of previous institutions, noble castle districts disappeared because of the fleeing of noblemen, so peasant burgers took over the organisation of local government.
Thus they preserved Hungarian legal customs and communal morals.
In this way it was easy to revive them after the Turks had left the country.
The relationship of the Hungarian state and the Hungarians in occupied areas: alliance with the Turks
As time passed the state and castle district organisations of Royal Hungary had greater and greater influence on the everyday life of the occupied areas.
By resetting the right of possession the relationship of the Hungarian authorities and private persons with the Turks was regulated in detail.
In 1574, 1575 and 1587 the Hungarian parliament banned voluntary surrender to the Turks.
Laws enacted in 1622, 1625 and 1635 prescribed execution and the confiscation of animals for those who formed an alliance with the Turks, or delivered weapons to them, or travelled to occupied areas without the permission of the Hungarian authorities.
The 1659 law, par. 13 considered border and possession cases as serious a crime as alliance with the Turks.
At the same time in the legal practice of castle districts "Turkish" crimes were quite frequent from the 1630s.
In the second half of the 17th century "Turkish" crimes were committed by people who wore Turkish clothes, took up Turkish customs (like smoking), forwarded Turkish letters, often appeared at Turkish fortresses, sold or pawned estates to the Turks, which had previously been in Hungarian hands, or bought / pawned such an estate from a Turk, turned to the Turkish kadhi in cases, which came under Hungarian authority.
The growing number of intellectuals in the mouth of the Turks
Despite the Turkish occupation in the 16-17th century Hungary remained linked to Europe's cultural blood circle.
The intellectual strata, the members of which studied at universities in the German empire, Italy, Switzerland or far away Netherlands or Britain, had an important role in this fact.
The spread of the Reformation in the 16th century encouraged the formation of famous colleges (Brassó, Debrecen, Sárospatak, Pápa) and hundreds of village schools besides the use of the Hungarian language.
In the coming century the counter-reformation had its impact on the country: Jesuit grammar schools (Gyõr, Kassa) and the university of Nagyszombat - founded by Péter Pázmány in 1635 - helped the development of Hungarian intellectuals.
As a result of these book printing flourished, literacy spread, and libraries became popular in the circle of noblemen and burgers.
Joining the group of intellectuals at Catholic, Protestant or state courts, in the city or at the castle district was a brilliant opportunity for lower social groups to rise.
Three orders - three nations: the Hungarians
As a result of medieval development the structure of the Transylvanian orders was different from those in other parts of Hungary.
In Transylvania the notion of order was synonymous with the notion of natio (nation), which did not mean the same as today.
The Hungarian people formed an independent order, that is, a natio, which included Hungarian noblemen only.
The conditions for joining the group of Hungarian noblemen were gaining the noble title and owning a land.
So a Hungarian nobleman could stem from any kind of nation, he was the member of the Hungarian order / nation, if he fulfilled the requirements.
Transylvanian nobility, as an order, could not really stand up for their interests against the principal.
The reason for this could be found in their poverty: on the one hand they possessed much smaller estates than their Hungarian counterparts, so their financial power was also smaller; on the other hand Transylvanian powers hindered the chances of asserting the interests of the orders in jurisdiction and government.
Three orders - three nations: the Székelys
In the history of the order of the Székely people the 16th century brought the final disintegration of medieval Székely society.
The formation of strata according to wealth was in process, the three groups of Székely people were formed.
Common Székelys became very poor, and this meant that they could barely fulfil military duties.
Such poor Székelys went to serve a rich Székely landlord, but they could live a freer life than Transylvanian villeins, since they had a contract with the landlord, and could move freely.
Between 1542-1551 György Fráter obliged the Székelys to pay tax in cash, and besides this they had to present their traditional tax, the ox-grilling.
The Székelys rebelled against this, there was a revolt in 1562, which was avenged by Zsigmond János, and in his orders. After the revolt he deprived the Székelys of their privileges which they had enjoyed for centuries.
Following this Transylvanian principals, who bore the title the Székelys' ispán (bailiff), promised to restore their privileges if they wanted to use the service of the Székely army, which was still very effective.
In 1636 György Rákóczi I obliged them to be loyal, when he invalidated jus Regium in the Székely land.
Their organisation of chairs - which was formed in the Middle Ages - was still functioning during the principality.
Three orders - three nations: the Saxons
At the head of the government of the Saxon natio was the Saxon count, who had held this position since 1486. This post was usually filled by the mayor of Szeben.
The order of Saxon people was the richest nation of Transylvania, because of their rich towns.
They preserved their privileges in the age of the principality, too, and thus they were independent in a sense. This independence was encouraged by the national consciousness of the Saxon people which had formed by the end of the 16th century through being loyal to Lutheran religious principles.
In 1545, during Bishop Paul Wiener's reign, the Saxon Lutheran church was established.
Bigger Saxon towns, like Nagyszeben, Brasso, Beszterce, and the German tradesmen of Kolozsvár - who became Hungarian by the end of the 16th century - broke into western markets with the products of the Saxon goldsmith's industry.
This, however, did not bring permanent prosperity and economic growth.
The Saxon guild industry kept its medieval organisation, and the establishment of guild unions limited production according to the narrow demands of the local market.
Transylvanian society in the 17th century
The population of the principality at the turn of the 16-17th centuries was about 1 million.
After the destruction of the 15-year war the period between 1657-1661 brought another significant devastation and a wave of migration within Transylvania and between Transylvania and the neighbouring Rumanian territories.
In the second half of the 17th century the population decreased to 700-800, 000 and 40-50% of the people were Hungarian, 10-15% Saxon and 30-40% Rumanian, partly because of the fact that the Partium fell under the authority of the Turks after the defeat of Várad.
Transylvanian aristocracy consisted of a few families only, the members of which were the advisors of the principal or filled other important posts in the government.
The institution of eternal main orders was not formed here, so noble families were at the mercy of the principal.
In this century middle and small estate owners dominated in Transylvania, bigger estates were usually in the possession of the principal.
Although during Apafi's reign a greater number of people became noble, thus the number of noblemen increased within the society, power still remained in the hands of the principal.
Saxon society preserved the independence of its orders, a special Saxon law and order - which was based on medieval privileges - till the middle of the century.
In 1651 they lost the right that they were not obliged to appear at the principal's court.
At this time another order was taken, according to which non-Saxons could buy houses in Saxon towns, and this broke down Saxon unity.
Rumanian people assimilated to the group of villeins in even greater number, and they gained a political influence comparable to that of the principals.
In the second half of the century the typical common strata of Transylvanian society were formed: the strata of intellectuals incorporating priests, lawyers, preachers, teachers, doctors and clerks.
Many of them received the noble title from Mihály Apafi.
Only few of the poor villeins were able to work in salt and ore mines, iron furnaces, glass workshops or mills.
The society of the Turks in Hungary
The number of Turks who settled down in Hungary was around 50-80,000, the majority of them being soldiers and clerks.
At the top of the conquerors' society there were the begler beghs, sandjak beghs, their deputies and the kadhis of the vilayet centers.
They were followed by the leaders of certain military and civilian units, the defterdars, the alay beghs, the captains of river fleets, the kadhis of sandjaks and the leaders of religious life: the powerful imams and lawyers.
Beghs were highly respected.
In the 16th century the pashas of Buda received 1 million akches, sandjak beghs received 200-400,000 akches a year on average, which was a big sum of money compared to the 30-70 akches income of the district kadhis (except for the Buda kadhi, who got 500 akche a day).
These powerful office holders were often replaced and removed (they were usually removed to other parts of the occupied regions).
Time spent in waiting without payment, the maintenance of the escort and bribing money exhausted their cash source, and although they had some supplementary incomes, they did not leave considerable amounts to their successors.
The middle strata of Turkish society in Hungary consisted of two bigger groups.
The members of this were tax collectors and common clerks (subashis, voivodes, emins), who could use their direct connections with tax payers to increase their own wealth.
On the same level were the educated people who took care of the spiritual needs of Turkish people: teachers of medrese schools, prelates of monasteries, the imams of smaller djamis and mosques.
Between the middle and lower strata there were wealthy tradesmen and certain craftsmen and timar-owning spahis, whose service estates brought more money than those of their colleagues serving in the central part of the empire.
At the lower end of the social ladder were the masses of fortress soldiers, who lived on 3-10 akches a day.
Underpayment forced them to find second jobs (mainly in the 17th century, when their pay lost its value).
Most of them tried to open a shop, practiced an industry, traded occasionally, then in the 17th century many of them engaged in farming.
LINGUISTICS
THE FIRST HALF OF THE MIDDLE HUNGARIAN PERIOD
The characteristic features of the language in the period
From the point of view of Hungarian linguistic history the first half of the Middle Hungarian period started after the disastrous defeat of Mohács and finished when Turkish rule ended (1526-1699).
The most important change in the language was unification, the development of literary language regardless of regional dialects.
The first step in this process was the appearance of regional variants (mainly the western and north-western variants became dominant). The gap separating them later narrowed, and they mingled - creating a unified Hungarian language variant.
There were minor changes in the system of the language as well: new elements appeared, old elements disappeared, and the number of these either increased or decreased, but these changes did not bring about important changes regarding the whole system of the Hungarian language, they just made it more refined.
In the Middle Hungarian period the language became much richer and more colourful and flexible.
The best evidence for this was that it became the poetic tool of excellent Hungarian poets such as Bálint Balassi, János Rimay, Miklós Zrínyi, and István Gyöngyösi. Prose was also developed by outstanding writers, for example Péter Bornemisza and Péter Pázmány.
The political situation (the country was divided into three parts) broke the tradition, whereby the royal court had played a major role in the proliferation of culture. Instead of this a new audience was formed in noble castles (the Perényis, the Zrínyis, the Batthyányis, the Rákóczis, the Báthoris, the Thurzós and the Eszterházis), who supported culture.
From what had at an earlier time been scriptoriums (codex copying workshops) - in Óbuda, the Island of Rabbits and elsewhere - monks and nuns fled, so the cultural, text copying and linguistic role of monasteries, which had been so significant in the Old Hungarian period, came to a temporary halt.
The spread of the Reformation started a new text creating process, which also had a great impact on linguistic development.
The language of schools was Latin in this period (there were hardly any schools for the common people, and the development of public education was very slow).
Thus Latin became the basic language for literate people.
It was quite usual for Latin words and sentences to be used in Hungarian texts, and Latin words were ascribed Hungarian endings.
The Latin text was sometimes typographically separated.
The language of science and administration was Latin, so we can appreciate the efforts when the authors of the first grammar books tried to create a scientific terminology (for example, János Sylvester: consonantes = mássalzengõk [consonants], imperativus = parancsoló [imperative].
As far as the development of Hungarian language usage was concerned the Reformation played an important role in the 16th century.
Reformers talked and argued for the reform of religion in the mother tongue.
Bible translations and collections of sermons were made for the same reason, and the language of theological disputes was also Hungarian (for example, between the Catholic Miklós Telegdi and the Protestant Péter Bornemisza).
Among Bible translations Gáspár Károlyi's work is worth mentioning (The Holy Bible, Vizsoly, 1590). It was also called the Vizsoly Bible, which was the first Hungarian complete Protestant Bible translation.
The text became the model of Old Testament style for centuries, and it was also popularised by the songs of the Reformation. It had a great impact on the development of Hungarian literary language.
This complete Bible was so successful that Károlyi's text was reedited several times - with minor changes and modifications - during the following centuries.
Its Catholic counterpart, the Jesuit György Káldi's work, was published in Vienna in 1626. It also had some revised editions.
Regarding the development of the Hungarian language it was a great success, when the leading figure of the so-called Counter-Reformation, Péter Pázmány created a linguistic model.
The singing of the contemporary event of history is also connected to the mother tongue (for example, Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos).
The language was dealt with in a deliberate manner for the first time during the 16-17th centuries in Hungary, when the first dictionaries and grammar books appeared. Patriotic feelings implied a feeling of being in connection to the mother tongue, so the cultivation and systematisation of it became an important issue.
Written texts were created in great numbers, which lead to the development of a lot of new genres in Hungarian fiction and scientific literature.
New secular genres were chronicles in verse, school dramas, historical songs, occasional songs; new ecclesiastical genres were Bible translations, religious didactic prose (polemical essays, praying works), religious songs, Bible stories, and dispute dramas.
From the point of view of linguistics, correspondence in the mother tongue was a very important issue in the Middle Hungarian period.
Missile letters had two main forms: the humanist letter, which satisfied literary requirements as well, and personal letters, which served the purpose of keeping in touch with family members.
These personal letters were very close to contemporary living language, so it is worth examining them.
Book printing
A technological innovation, the appearance of book printing played a highly significant role in the spread of the mother tongue in the country.
Starting with the 1530s several printing houses began to function in different parts of Hungary (János Sylvester's, or Tamás Nádasdy's press in Újsziget, near Sárvár; the Hoffgreff printing house in Kolozsvár, which was taken over by Gáspár Heltai; Gál Huszár's press in Debrecen; the Klöss press in Bártfa, and the Brewer press in Lõcse).
The development of book printing had a great impact on the spread of culture and the Hungarian language, and it made cheap printed books available to a wide range of people. Books became travelling companions to educated people, and the permanent residents of castles.
Book printing encouraged the spread of literacy among simple people.
In contrast to previous manuscript forms, writers had to satisfy the demand for more authentic and richer ways of recording texts.
Codex copiers had had a very different attitude towards the original manuscripts than did printers (type setters, correctors).
In the 16-17th centuries they were able to intervene in the language of printed works, some of them - for example, Heltai - adjusted the original text of the author to their own language usage.
So certain linguistic inconsistencies and mixed text styles can be attributed to the printers.
The changes influenced the linguistic phenomena in various ways.
But they definitely played a major role in creating a demand for a unified Hungarian literary language.
So book printing was very important from the point of view of linguistic unity.
It raised literacy to high standards and made the recording of text more accurate. Since the rapid spread of works was in the interest of both the author and the printer, the use of local dialects was avoided wherever possible, and this process contributed to the unification of the language and encouraged people to pay attention to their language in Hungary.
Hungarian grammar books and dictionaries
The series of secular textual memories of the 16th century started with two works printed in Krakow: the first was Hegendorf's Rudimenta grammatices Donati, and the second was Heyden Sebald's Tverilium Colloquiorum Formulae.
These were multilingual books (besides the Hungarian parts, there were sections in Latin, German and Polish); used as grammar books in schools, the Hungarian example sentences and explanations of which originate from János Sylvester.
Sylvester's own, independent work is Grammatica Hungarolatina, which is a Latin-Hungarian grammar in Latin with Hungarian examples.
His goal was to summarise the grammar of the Latin language, but the Hungarian equivalents or differences following the Latin rules, and the comments on these reflect several special features of the Hungarian language.
Numerous spelling, phonetic, morphological (articles, possessive suffixes, definite inflection [objective]), vocabulary and stylistic rules were mentioned here first (with his encouragement several Bible translators felt the necessity to write essays on preaching).
He applied the described rules consistently in his works, so grammar could play an important role.
His significance was that he considered the Hungarian language - which was thought to be a barbaric one - suitable for fitting into a grammatical structure, just as Latin, Greek or Hebrew did.
In the introduction to his grammar he drew the following conclusion: 'if we can use our language, this treasure - which was hidden from us until now, but which we discovered and brought into the light - we will soon become wealthy (as I hope and desire)'.
The first printed grammatical work written solely in Hungarian was a book on spelling rules, Mátyás Dévai Bíró's Orthographia Vngarica (Krakow, 1549). The first edition from 1535 was unfortunately lost, so we can only learn about these rules from the second edition.
As a source of the history of the language, this work is more than just a collection of spelling rules. In the framework of orthographic rules Dévai mentioned a lot of phonetic and morphological features of the language.
Based on his knowledge of old and contemporary spelling, German and Polish orthographic literature he compiled the first set of spelling rules, which described every important bit of Hungarian spelling.
For example, he differentiated between the forming and marking of sounds a and á.
Another example of the consonants showed how exactly he knew the old and contemporary markings.
He did not favour the marking of the sound cs as cz, ch or c, and he was against using the old mark for L (Hussite marking).
For marking the sound cs, Dévai himself used cz at the beginning of the word, but in the middle and at the ends he used (.
His most special markings were the assimilated sounds of az/ez (for example, ak kerest'enecnec, al lelki, eh haszonra).
His aim - as he was a pioneer in the development of the language - was to spread literacy.
The first 17th-century Hungarian grammar was written by Albert Szenczi Molnár, and was called Novae Grammaticae Ungaricae (Hanau, 1610).
When compiling his work he probably did not know Sylvester's work, although he had the same aim, namely to prove the fact that the Hungarian language was on the same level as other European languages.
He also wanted to make Hungarian available for foreigners who wished to learn it, so he presented not only spelling rules, but also a complete grammatical system, the basis of which was Latin grammar.
For example, he describes the system of inflection in two chapters, first together with the Latin declination classes, then with the Hungarian suffixes of Latin prepositions.
Compared to previous grammars his most important innovation was that his work contained syntax as well, the old syntactical rules being mentioned here in detail for the first time.
He talked about agreement, and discovered that no subject was used after the third person plural.
His role in the development of spelling is worth mentioning.
He summarised all the principles about spelling, and fixed the marking of u and V. He decreased the variations in marking, and the so-called Protestant spelling spread throughout his works.
This system - as Heltai's heritage - fixed the marking of long vowel sounds, the writing of palatal consonants (which is the same as we use today) and the marking of sound sz.
Szenci was the first who used the language consciously in his works - having surveyed its contemporary condition (vocabulary and grammatical system).
His books had a tremendous impact on people.
He followed the é dialect instead of the í one, and used the ë instead of the ö one. Thus he created a more unified dialect free from local extremes.
István Geleji Katona was the first to write on language development in the broader sense of the word.
He developed Transylvanian culture, studying and spreading contemporary Hungarian language and spelling.
He dealt with Hungarian spelling, composition and style, probably under the influence of contemporary German linguistic societies.
He wrote about the peculiarities of the Hungarian language in two works: in his introduction to a collection of songs called The Old Gradual and in his Magyar Grammatikatska, which was added to a book containing his theological essays called The Secret of Secrets.
Geleji formed his conclusions about the Hungarian language based on his literary work.
In the introduction to The Old Graduale he drew attention to the following features: in contrast to the theory used in spelling up to that time, people should use the theory of word analysis.
His comment on marking sounds was quite significant.
He separated the letters i, y, j.
In connection with marking sounds his comment on runic writing was very interesting: he claimed that old letters should be used for marking the respective sounds.
This is in contrast with the word analysing method, and we do not know whether he knew these old letters, but it is a very important piece of information from the point of view of cultural history.
In the field of morphology he lacked the separation of active and passive verbs, and the fact that words of possession were used in the singular, no matter how many are being referred to.
Geleji's other work about the language was the Magyar Grammatikatska [Little Hungarian Grammar].
The most significant part of this was that he defined the basic principles of spelling with the development of phonetic signs used for the basic sounds (for example, he excluded c when referring to the sound k).
He also supported the word analysing method in spelling, and in connection with this topic he dealt with the spelling of assimilation and compound words, which had been a neglected field up to that time.
His comment on the spelling of compound words is also worth noting, according to which 'he connected the elements of the compound word with the help of a short line', for example, Anya-szent-egy-ház [the Church].
In harmony with the rules today, he suggested the usage of Hungarian spelling in the case of loan words, for example, Farao, Profeta.
He had some stylistic remark in his work about the suitability of the words used in a special context, as he attributed great value to emotions in vocabulary, and under Szenczi's influence he drew attention to the richness of suffixes in the Hungarian language.
Geleji played an important role in developing the vocabulary, especially in the field of technical terms, so could be considered the forerunner of language reform.
He bravely declared that forming new words is acceptable, and he really introduced a lot of common words in literature, and formed even more technical terms (terminus technicus), which are still in use today, for example, intézet [institution], emberiség [humankind], and élõbeszéd [living speech].
Thus he played a major role in the development of Hungarian literary language.
However, the Magyar Grammatikatska is not a systematic grammar, it is rather a collection of suggestions concerning spelling and vocabulary, it is the first book on the cultivation of the language.
He had a great impact on people and as a result gained numerous followers as well as opponents. He did not isolate himself when talking about his views concerning the language.
One of his opponents was Pál Medgyesi, who wrote a book on preaching and rhetorics in 1650.
We can consider it the first Hungarian systematic rhetoric, where he made a distinction, for example, between speeches for common people and speeches for noble audiences.
The most outstanding follower of Geleji was János Apáczai Csere, who wanted to form secular technical terms within the world of science.
He used Magyar Grammatikatska a lot, it is also possible that he had personal discussions with Geleji about the forming of technical terms.
János Apáczai Csere studied from great humanists, and recognised that the language is a system which can be formed and the vocabulary be developed in three major ways: 1. by rewriting words in the mother tongue which were less frequently used, 2. by creating new words, 3. by using words taken from foreign languages.
He used the second method a lot, the basic principles of which he studied from Geleji.
He adopted several expressions from him, for example, quantitas [quantity]; he acquired new ways of forming words, for example, passive structures and shorter forms, and he tried to use Geleji's rule, i.e. that one Hungarian word should be used for expressing a notion which was expressed with a single foreign word.
Apáczai's Encyclopaedia was highly significant, not only from the point of view of word forming, but also because of the fact that he emphasised that only the mother tongue is suitable for understanding the world and one another.
(This principle was previously explained by Comenius, but he preferred Latin in his school books, and the vulgar parts were only interpretations of the Latin texts.)
Unfortunately, Apáczai did not have a great impact on the language or science.
György Komáromi Csipkés's Hungaria Illustrata (1655) was the next Hungarian grammar book.
Although he concentrated on spelling and morphology in his work, he discovered numerous minor points in connection with the structure of the Hungarian language.
He re-evaluated the contemporary linguistic phenomena from the point of view of grammatical accuracy and style.
It is very important that in the process of forming the rules the author was driven by the function of the language and not Latin grammar.
He recognised the importance of establishing a unified spelling system, and he developed the phonetic spelling; for example, he approved the usage of long vowels: á, é. By describing morphological rules in detail, he fixed certain phenomena which had previously existed in variations.
To unify the spelling of words which existed in numerous forms he used only one form consistently.
For example, he corrected previous observations about the comparative and superlative of adjectives, in regard to declination he declared that there is only one type of declination in Hungarian.
He recognised the morphological and functional differences between general (subjective) and definite (objective) forms of declination.
In the course of his linguistic observations he also dealt with the question of how suitable the Hungarian language was for study.
This can be linked with the author's knowledge of languages (Greek, Hebrew, eastern languages), so he often compared Hungarian - especially phonetic features - with other languages.
He also published two books on Hebrew grammar and one on English grammar, so teaching languages must have been an important issue for him.
György Komáromi Csipkés - as a scientist - probably had quite a reputation at the time, since he was entrusted with publishing a new Protestant Bible in Debrecen.
Because of the chaotic situation this Bible was not published during his lifetime, but rather posthumously in Leyden in 1719.
Pál Pereszlényi's Grammatica Lingvae Ungaricae (1682) is the second almost complete summary of the grammar of the Hungarian language.
The aim of the author was to create a grammar book which would help in the teaching of the language.
He took his examples from the works of Péter Pázmány and György Káldi, proving his commitment to the Jesuits and his linguistic ideals.
The significance of Pereszlényi's grammar is that we can find comments on syntax as well (in this respect his predecessor was Albert Szenczi Molnár), and he recorded several contemporary phenomena backed up by lots of examples.
He dealt with possessive forms, and he realised that one element had en ending in the dative case (-nak/-nek ending) and the possessive word had a third person possessive ending.
Very systematically - without precedents - he described the cases when the -nak/-nek ending could be omitted in the possessive.
He set out a rule - similar to the one used today - about relative pronouns.
While observing linguistic features, Pereszlényi discovered a very important thing: vowel harmony. He described it as the key to the Hungarian language.
His long chapter on verbs and conjugation is probably the most valuable and most independent part of his work.
It is interesting and new that Pereszlényi categorised conjugation according to the different forms and endings, just as it is done today. There were four categories (subjective, objective, passive and ik-type).
It is also very interesting what Pereszlényi thought about tenses: the narrative past was really used for describing the historical past at that time.
If we compare Pereszlényi's work with previous grammars, we can see that he stuck to Latin examples, he used more of them than his predecessors, but he paid more attention to examining stylistic elements (he respected the different styles of authors and the different stylistic elements of different genres).
Even though his work developed from the Jesuit educational system, and his work remained the leading book on Catholic spelling, he adopted a lot of things from the works of Albert Szenczi Molnár, István Geleji Katona and György Komáromi Csipkés. In many cases he used these authors' norms, which showed that the Hungarian language was slowly moving towards standardisation and adjustment.
Printed word lists, dictionaries and phrase-books
In this period the publishing of printed word lists became a business, and the range of users also widened.
While earlier they were only used in school, by the 16-17th centuries they were being made for private use, and their function changed as well: they were not used for learning the Latin language any more, but became the tools of studying the mother tongue, they also functioned as a means of high-quality literacy, that is, stylistics. Besides these functions they helped the verbal communication of people who spoke different languages.
Multi-lingual word lists and dictionaries became very popular.
From among the ones which contained Hungarian János Sylvester's word list in four languages was published in Krakow in 1531. This is known only from bibliographical records, the original one has never turned up.
A Dutch scientist's, Murmellius' Latin-German word list was also very popular, and its 1533 Krakow edition contained Hungarian material as well.
In 1538 in Vienna Gábor Pesti's work in six languages was published, which was known mainly abroad.
Balázs Szikszai Fabricius compiled a Latin-Hungarian word list in 1590.
The Italian Calepinus' dictionary, which was finally published in eleven languages, appeared in the 16th century (Lyon, 1585: it included thousands of Hungarian words and phrases).
In Veranics's dictionary in five languages (Venice, 1595) there are only 5,400 Hungarian words, but this can be considered the predecessor of Hungarian etymological dictionaries, since at the end it listed the loan words in the Hungarian language which - according to the author - might have been of Slav origin.
The most significant dictionary of the 17th century was Albert Szenczi Molnár's work called Dictionarivm Latinovngaricvm and Dictionarivm Vngaricolatinvm (Nürnberg, 1604): this was the first dictionary, where Hungarian was the source language.
In the 16th century phrase-books - made after European models and using them as sources - became popular, which collected bigger phraseological units.
The first one in Hungary was János Baranyai Decsi's work, which was published in 1598 in Bártfa and contained 5,000 phrases.
The development of literary language
The sign of the birth of a non-dialectal ideal language was the appearance of the above-mentioned grammar books and dictionaries.
The period itself was also ideal for dealing with the mother tongue: the Reformation encouraged people to read religious literature in the mother tongue, and humanism placed an emphasis on the conscious study of the language.
As we have already seen, in the first half of the 16th century certain Hungarian writers used their own dialects, for example, Sylvester tried to bring the í dialect to literary rank, Gábor Pesti followed the tradition of chancelleries, Heltai used a special dialect in his works and Dévai tried to make up a transitional spelling.
All these experiments led to the fact that clerks tried to use a special dialect in written communication, which was different from all the existing ones.
Although they intended to stick to the rules, they tried to avoid dialectal features, but their sense of adjustment was not yet stable.
By the 17th century there were two separate systems.
The north-eastern dialect was the í-type, and it used the tött, vött type past tense.
The western dialect used the ö-type forms and the suffix ít was used like ét.
Not only scientists but also the cultivators of literature played an important role in bringing the mother tongue to a literary rank.
In this period several new genres were born (many of them were based on translation), which reflected the flexibility and richness of the Hungarian language and helped in the development of more punctual, more colourful expressions.
In the dedication part of János Sylvester's translation of the New Testament he used nice Hungarian distichs to prove that the language was suitable for classical poetry and only a few European languages could compete with it.
In the preface of Gábor Pesti's Aesop's Fables (1536) the author declared that the cultivation of the mother tongue is a duty that everyone must fulfil.
These experiments prove that humanist intellectuals felt it was their task to deal with the mother tongue.
Hungarian writers played a major role in the development of stylistics and style (on both theoretical - e.g.: Rimay - and practical levels - e.g.: Pázmány).
Only a few of them can be examined, since the majority of authors created their own, specific style, making the Hungarian language richer and more valued.
The two outstanding poets of the period were Bálint Balassi and Miklós Zrínyi.
Balassi's main merit from the point of view of the language was his talent in creating poetic pictures and images. He himself mentioned it in the prologue of the Fine Hungarian Comedy.
Balassi's text reviser, János Rimay also pointed out the importance of enriching the language through poetry.
In his rhetoric Rimay preferred the method of paraphrasing, though he was not happy about the fact that in Hungary knowledge of the secrets of rhetoric was rare on the ground.
He believed that the way to rise above common speech was to learn rhetoric, the characteristic features of which are: the richness of vocabulary, the enrichment of simple adjectival structures and the multiplication of synonyms in the case of verbal predicates.
The significance of Miklós Zrínyi's work was the conscious use of the Hungarian language.
In his works he wrote about the fact that he used a kind of unnatural language on purpose.
His prosaic works followed classical rhetorical patterns.
His Epic poem and his lyrical works still show some dialectical features, although we can find some tools of archaisation in them, for example, when he imitated the vala rhymes of historical songs or the usage of the past tense.
In his works he considered the limits of the Hungarian language as an insufficiency.
From the point of view of language development this was a warning and inspiration to form a standardised Hungarian literary language and form of spelling.
István Gyöngyösi was the most outstanding thinker of stylistics and poetry in the 17th century. He was the founder of light court style poetry.
Due to his popularity he had a great impact on the usage and forms of the language in the 18th century.
In the preface of his epic poem entitled János Kemény's Memory he wrote about the differences between common speech and the speech used in poetry. He mentioned the freedom of the poet to manipulate the language, word formation and the usage of words and forms of the local dialect carefully chosen from the point of view of style.
In connection with the prosaic style two persons must be mentioned, Péter Bornemisza and Péter Pázmány, who looked to different churches.
Bornemisza re-established preaching literature.
In his stories (especially in Devilish Ghosts) he used the poetic tools of dramatic concentration and emphasis, and he was the one who best used real life experiences as a technique for reasoning.
In his Electra translation he tried to reflect living speech.
Péter Pázmány raised several ecclesiastic genres to the level of the literary language (for example, polemical essays, preaching, gracious prose).
His polemical essays were the most excellent pieces of Hungarian prose: he made his writing even more colourful by the use of satire, mockery and humour, and he was very talented in the use of turns of style parody.
His merit in the development of the language was that he could turn living speech into a rhetoric art.
He was very good at using proportional, articulate and well-balanced periods.
A very effective element of his style was straight-forward, harsh naturalism; he used the linguistic treasure from the images of the Bible as well as dramatic turns.
In his works we can read about his views on the language (Preaching).
He concentrated on the moral impact of the language, and pointed out the role of language in culture: 'The aim of the language is to spread wise sciences'.
It is also worth mentioning Pázmány's views on translation.
This was a huge problem in the period as the new genres came from foreign languages, so the translators had to struggle with the differences in the structure of the languages.
It was very important when Pázmány emphasised the fact that the translation must sound as if it was from the mouth of a Hungarian native speaker.
The structure of the language in this period
The most significant changes in the Hungarian language took place in the Ancient Hungarian period.
The Old Hungarian period was also very important - although less significant, as there were only peripheral changes in the system, which concerned minor details rather than grammatical rules.
However, the structure of the language in the Middle Hungarian period became richer - in regard to both vocabulary and the grammatical structure.
Dialects
As was mentioned before, the most important development of the age was the establishment of a standardised literary language.
We can define the dialects compared to this linguistic norm. These dialects had their impact on literary language, especially in the vocabulary.
The most evident method of the categorisation of dialects is the examination of phonetic features, which were typical for a given region, and they were not adopted by the standard language (for example, ó > uo, ao in the region beyond the river Tisza).
Phonetic structure
In this period there were only a few changes in the general phonetic structure which took place not only in the majority of dialects but also in literary language.
One of them was when the long open e turned into é (kez > kéz), which was completed by the second half the 17th century, except for some dialects. So the long open e phoneme ceased to exist.
The structure of phoneme was broadened by one single element, dzs. It was adopted from Osman-Turkish loan words: findzsa, dzsida.
A more general feature in the Middle Hungarian period was the change in the load on phonemes.
This process concerned the phoneme ly: partly it became j, partly l, for example, Kiraj (1696), mihalt, heltelen (1585).
The ly > l change could be strongly detected in the Transdanubian region, especially in its southern and western parts, and later it became a dialectal characteristic feature, and the j pronunciation spread to most parts of Hungary.
The affricanisation in the suffix -ózik/-ozik (1645: Rugodzik) increased the frequency of phoneme dz.
Vocabulary
The acceleration of the change in the way of life in the 16-17th centuries also enriched the vocabulary of the Hungarian language in spite of the historical vicissitudes.
This process was helped by the development in literature, the spread of book printing, which increased the number of readers, and the developing literary language.
The strong literary influence contributed to the forming of new expressions of full delicate tones. So the forming of expressive, onomatopoetic words became quite intensive in the period.
Word formation contributed to the richness of the Hungarian language with several new elements from the Mohács disaster in 1526 to the reoccupation of Buda in 1686.
Words referring to concrete objects were formed: szegély [edge], kendõ [kerchief], kenõcs [ointment], tekercs [roll], küldemény [parcel].
A lot of words were formed which referred to abstract ideas: lehetõség [possibility], karcsúság [slimness], aggodalom [worry], lelemény [creative thought].
From among new noun forming suffixes the diminutive suffix -i is worthy of note, which became popular very soon (for names like Mari, Feri, Pali).
The suffix -né, used for referring to the marital status of women [= Mrs], had already appeared in the Old Hungarian period, but became general only in this age (Kápolnai Ferencné [Mrs Ferenc Kápolnai]).
New noun forming suffixes were -aj/-ej, which was added to fictive onomatopoetic roots: kacaj [laugh], dörej [thunderbolt].
The most vivid verb forming frequentative suffixes were -dogál/-degél/-dögél, -doz/-dez/-döz, -gat/-get.
From among motif suffixes -amodik, -int, -ít were active.
There were changes in the function of certain suffixes: -at/-et, which had referred to the process of the action previously, but now signified the result of the action.
The previous role of -at/-et was taken over by -ás/-és; this suffix also signified the place of the action in the Middle Hungarian period (lakás [living in an apartment], szállás [accommodation]).
But the majority of suffixes functioned in the same way as before.
Compound words were made up to refer to new notions, it was a more efficient method than word formation.
In this period there were a lot of new compound words: e.g., könyvnyomtató [book printer].
Many of these new words do not exist in modern Hungarian any more, e.g, hajnyomtató [hair presser = hair band], igazlátó [judge], szembelétel [trial, interview].
There were reduplicated forms in the language: dirib-darab [pieces], terefere [chat].
Conscious word forming was the characteristic feature of the language reform (later), but there were individual initiations in this period as well.
János Sylvester, for example, formed a lot of technical terms: köznév[common name], tulajdonnév [proper name], vádoló [accusative]. He also used new names of months: instead of februaris or böjtelõ hó [the month before the fast] he used lágyhó [smooth month], instead of október or mindszent hava [the month of all saints] he used borvetõ hó [wine month].
Geleji Katona also encouraged word formation in theory.
A lot of his words have been forgotten since then, but some of them have survived szerzemény [acquisition], hozomány [dowry], emberiség [humankind].
János Apáczai Csere also created several scientific terms: középpont [origo], súrlódás [friction], kiterjedtség [expansion], számláló [numerator], nevezõ [denominator].
In the 16-17th centuries the polite form of addressing people was formed in the language; in connection with this, new pronouns were used; for example, maga [self > you] became a personal pronoun.
This process might have started when the second person pronoun was supplemented with very polite titles: te Kegyelmed [your grace], ti Nagyságtok [you greatness].
These were the forms used for theeing each other.
However, owing to longer forms of address the second person pronoun (te tegyed, ti jóságotok) were changed into third person pronouns (te Kegyelmed tegye, ti Nagyságtok jósága).
One of the ways of enriching the vocabulary is to attribute new meaning to words - especially the main forms of speech (verbs and nouns).
In the 16th century jámbor [good man] meant 'honest, sincere', but Geleji Katona explained that it was used for 'fool, ugly'.
The word agyafúrt [cunning] had several meanings until today: 'one with a broken skull' > 'crazy' > 'stubborn' > 'cunning, shrewd'(1616).
One explanation for the change in meaning is that homonyms are created when the name of an object is transferred to an other object; there are two parallel forms in the language, then one of the meanings becomes dominant.
So the word bolt [arched ceiling, a room for trade] got its meaning in the same way in the 16-17th centuries.
In the Middle Ages bolt referred to workshops on the side of bigger buildings, so it was frequently used for places of trade or selling.
In the 16th century compound words like kalmárbolt [merchant's shop], patikaszerszámosbolt [apothek tools shop] were quite popular, while in the 17th century it was very rare with this meaning (búzásbolt [seed store]).
Another way of enriching the vocabulary was borrowing words from foreign languages.
The language of science, politics and culture was still Latin, and its usage was so widespread that several Latin words were built into the Hungarian language as loan words.
The words of Protestant church organisation (kollégium [college], kurátor [curator], presbyter [presbyter]), and school (ceruza [pencil], kotta [musical notes], professzor [professor] ) and the life of the state ( apellálni [to appeal], citálni [to cite], dieta [parliament]) were adopted during the 16-17th centuries.
German loan words were used in every field of life: porcelán [porcelain], kugli [pinball], kalap [hat], cukor [sugar], prés [press], drót [wire], mundér [uniform], and kvartély [accommodation].
Slav loan words were associated with farming (szecska [chaff], repce [rape], hombár [garner]), illnesses (csömör [surfeit], zsába [neuralgia]).
Italian loan words were connected to cooking: saláta [salad], mazsola [raisin], torta [cake].
Turkish loan words were used in state administration and for military ranks (we can meet them in Balassi's and Zrínyi's works), but some of these are used as historical terms only: vilajet [vilayet], szandzsak [sandjak], bég [governer].
Besides words which slowly disappeared from the language, there are some old ones used in connection with eating, for example, kávé [coffee], ibrik [cup], findzsa, (tea-cup), and items of clothing (pamut [cotton], papucs [slipper]).
The grammatical structure
In conjugation the following main changes took place in the usage of general (subjective) and definite (objective) forms: in the Old Hungarian period the second person forms of certain verbs (ending in -t) in the imperative were used as taníts [teach], láss [see].
In the second half of the 16th century even Péter Bornemisza used this form like this: ne keseríts [do not make {her} sad].
However, in the 17th century this phenomenon disappeared from the language, and the regular tanítsd [teach], lásd [see], tanítsad [teach], lássad [see] came back into use.
There was an inconsistency in using other forms of definite conjugation: next to a definite subject we could often find a general verb.
Although the regular form - which is used in modern Hungarian as well - was more frequently used, this does not constitute a change in the rules, it was only a vacillation.
In many cases the definite conjugation might have been a tool for expressing different styles, as Zrínyi used the archaic technique in his epic poem, The Disaster of Sziget, which tried to copy the atmosphere of historic songs with the modification of grammatical rules.
The -ik type conjugation was also modified.
The forms of paradigm with -ik and without -ik were mixed, and it can be traced in contemporary grammar books.
For example, Pál Kövesdi (1686) thought it was all the same which form we use (the -ik or the one without -ik), sometimes he preferred the one without -ik.
The group of verbs ending in -ik itself became changeable: some verbs ending in -ik (lépik [step], köpik [spit]) lost their endings, while the ones without the -ik ending (buv [hide], hazud [lie], foly [flow]) took on an -ik ending, and even more, some verbs had two forms in the third person singular, for example, omol [come down], romol [go bad], omlik, romlik (Pál Pereszlényi, 1682).
Regarding tenses, the different functions of past tenses became unified.
First the function of vár vala [was/were waiting] type past continuous became weaker.
Although Tinódi's numerous rhyming vala-s referred to incompleted actions, it replaced the narrative past in several cases.
The vártam vala or vártam volt [I waited] type (it was another kind of past tense) slowly took over the role of the narrative past.
The functional differences between vára : várt also became insignificant.
Both versions appeared with the same function.
According to the Latin conjugation system grammar books still made a distinction between the past tenses, although they did not identify them with Latin verb forms.
So the system of past tenses became simpler.
As a result of this process the most frequently used form of the past tense became the -t, but the várá type was also in use.
There were changes in the usage of the future tense as well.
The future tense expressed with a time suffix became rare (várand), instead of this form the analytic fog type was used (várni fog), or the simple present.
All these changes in conjugation were encouraged by the fact that the system of prepositions also began to develop.
New prepositions were formed as some adverbs changed their function: agyon [all/over], neki [against], keresztül [through], szét [apart]. The function of some prepositions became different, for example, the function of the -nd type future was taken over by a prepositional present tense: látandom - (majd meglátom) [I will see]; while the perfective role of the preposition to express past continuous and past perfect tenses became an easier and more flexible tool than relevant verb forms (thus the perfect forms could be expressed in the conditional: meglátta volna) Prepositional verb forms from this period were, for example, megbotoz [beat with a stick], felcifráz [decorate], lemond [resign], leborotvál [shave off].
There were changes in the morphological structure of verb forms: conditional forms such as várnája, kérnéjék (conditional with definite conjugation) were pushed back, simpler verb forms (várná [he/she would wait for it], kérnék [they would ask it] became more popular.
However, in the case of other elements, paradigms or long forms remained in use besides the short forms: láttak, kértek - láttanak, kértenek.
The usage of Latin moods (the usage of the conditional mood in certain subordinate clauses) in the literary language was still in practice in the period, but the Hungarian usage of the language became more widespread.
The system of adverbial suffixes and postfixes was also characterised by richer, finer forms at that time.
Számra [for me], számára [for him/her], szemben [opposite], folytán [during] became postfixes in the 16th century.
The meaning of alatt [under] widened and became more abstract.
The postfix képpen (> képp) [as, in a ...way] turned into an inflectional ending.
In Transylvanian linguistic sources the so-called family ending of place -nott (where?), -nól (where from?), -ni (where to?), which followed proper names or nouns referring to jobs, appeared in this period.
Nominal qualifying adjectives became rare by this time.
Certain nominal adjectives turned into adjectives.
From among infinitive predicates the ones which referred to perception were in use, for example, Heltai: 'It's easy to understand how evil drunkenness is'.
Besides its original adverbial function the infinitive was also used as a subject or object, following other nouns (or participial) patterns, it played the role of a verb, too.
During the 17th century the ván/-vén type adverbial participles were pushed back.
Their function changed: they turned into time and casual complements, while the va/-ve type forms turned into adverbs of manner and state.
Mondvám, mondvád type participles with personal endings were also pushed back (for the lack of a function).
The -val/-vel type and the rare atta/-ette type adverbial participles were out of use by the end of the period, and were preserved only in the Székely dialect.
It was an important change in the Middle Hungarian period that instead of participle forms detailed, analytic subordinate clauses were used.
In the 17th century periods adjectives and adverbial forms became very popular.
The greatest Hungarian writers, such as Pázmány and Zrínyi followed this baroque style.
This fact had an impact on the usage of compound sentences.
The baroque style enriched the language, including harmonious and multi-level co-ordination and several new conjunctions.
Conjunctions such as szinte [as if], szintén [too], separator részint ... részint [on the one hand ... on the other hand], the contrastive ellenben [but, however], the concluding tehát [so, thus], and the explaining ugyanis [since, as] were created or widespread at that time.
The number of conjunctions in subordinate clauses also grew, for example, in time clauses meddig, ameddig [until, till] were used and in conditional sentences if became the fixed conjunction, mert [because] - which meant 'that' previously as it was the translation of the Latin quia - was used as the conjunction of casual and final clauses.
TURKISH LOAN WORDS
Linguistic review
Turkish, the source language
Osman-Turkish loan words in the Hungarian language - ignoring the changes that took place in the Hungarian language when adopting them or later - reflect the 16-17th-century Osman-Turkish language.
This Turkish language was under the strong influence of the Arabic and Persian languages, and its vocabulary was full of Arabic and Persian elements.
The phonetic characteristic features of loan words in the Hungarian language were influenced by the fact that the transmitters of these words were the Turks of the Balkans (closest to Hungary) and not the Turks originating from the centre of the Empire.
This means that the 'hinterland' of the occupied territories of Hungary was not Anatolia, but the closer part of the Balkan Peninsula.
The armed forces, the administrational staff and the craftsmen and tradesmen who supplied them, came from there.
So the deliverers of Turkish loan words were the Turks settled in the countries of the Balkans and the native Slav people, who became Turks.
Southern Slav delivery
The Turks in Anatolia did not have enough power to conquer south-east Europe, which had previously been under the authority of the Turkish sultan.
After conquering the Balkan Peninsula, the Slav people of the Balkans played a major role in further conquests.
The majority of the Muslim army which occupied Hungary was of Slav origin: Bosnians, Croatians, Serbs.
The most important element of their army, the yanichars, were usually the children of Christian parents living in the Balkans - as a result of the recruitment method.
These Slav soldiers from the Balkans spoke Turkish as well as their Slav mother tongue.
Besides soldiers, whose mother tongue was Slav, the Slav population of the Balkans who fled from the Turks and settled in the southern part of Transdanubia and the Great Plain, also played an important role in transmitting the language.
The fleeing people from the Balkans sometimes reached Buda or Esztergom.
Owing to this fact the Hungarian people were exposed to Turkish words from Turks and Slavs at the same time, so the loan words were built into the language from two sources: Turkish and Slav.
Words which were used in two variants - for example, szpahi - szpahia, pite - pita - reflected this situation very well.
Rumanian mediation
Transylvania had a direct connection with Constantinople and the Turks.
The majority of loan words appearing in Transylvanian sources was directly taken from the Turkish language, but the possibility of Rumanian mediation cannot be excluded. Thus Rumanian forms might have played an important role as well. For example, kantár 'scales', kilim 'carpet, blanket' and muszuly 'type of textile'.
Western mediation
In the history of the relationship between East and West the expansion of the Osman Empire into south-east Europe and to the Mediterranean played a very significant role. As a result of this Turkish words used in the army, government, diplomacy, trade and religion (such as aga, basha, begh, sandjak, sultan, kaftan, coffee, mufti and minaret) found their way into European languages.
There is only one double loan word, where the Turkish and the Western form might have been the same, and this is Osman - Ottoman. The variant Osman was directly from the Turkish language, Ottoman was taken from European languages.
Words of Turkish origin
Warfare
The occupied territory in Hungary was a critical border region of the Osman Empire, and warfare raged continuously there.
It is not surprising that people borrowed a lot of words used in warfare. They knew Turkish expressions referring to ranks, weapons and several words in connection with war.
The Turkish army consisted of infantry, cavalry, artillery, a fleet on the Danube and various supplementary units.
Infantry included yanichars, secondary troops consisted of azaps (azabs), who sometimes outnumbered the yanichars.
Originally seymens also belonged to the yanichar force, and later mercenary soldiers were also referred to in this way.
The expression haramia originally meant a soldier of the infantry.
The first line of the cavalry consisted of gönöllüs (voluntary soldiers, in Hungarian gyömli-s).
A separate, smaller group of cavalry was called the group of beslis or beslias (five).
A similar special group was that of the delis, that is 'the crazy ones', who were responsible for very dangerous action.
The troops of martaloc-s consisted of Christian mercenary soldiers.
The largest and most important element of the cavalry included the units of spahis and zaimons, who were paid in estates, called timár.
The artillery had an important role in besieging fortresses.
Canon men, bomb throwers and miners also belonged to this group.
It is surprising that the names referring to these units were not used in the contemporaneous Hungarian language.
The words szatyma - which still exist in certain dialects meaning 'hail-shot' - and kazán - which originally meant the cauldron for making salpetre necessary for gunpowder - referred to the usage of fire-arms.
At the head of the Danubian fleet was the 'Danubian kapudan', and units of smaller fleets were lead by the kapudan.
The crew consisted of people living near the Lower-Danube, called azabs.
There are several names in the sources for types of ships, however, only the name tombász is used today in some dialects.
The word kátrány [tar] is the memory of Turkish shipping, which originally referred to the material used for preserving the wood of the ship.
Special units were those of sappers, gunsmiths, tent builders, wagon makers and cooks, but the names for these appeared only in very few sources.
The only exception is the word szahora, which meant the irregular soldier who built bridges and roads or carried weapons.
Messengers, who forwarded orders, were called csausz-s.
They worked not only in the army, but also in field of state administration.
Smaller military units of the Turkish army were called bölük and oda, they usually consisted of ten people, headed by the bölük basha or the oda basha.
The leaders of yanichar units were called csorbacsi.
The head of bigger units incorporating soldiers performing the same service was the aga or basha.
The deputy of the aga was the kethüda - in Hungarian the kihaya.
The ranks basha and kihaya were also used in state administration.
The head of yanichar units sent to towns was called szerdár, but the same word referred to the leader or commander of the army.
The szeraszker or cseribasha was one of the military leaders of the timar army, but szeraszker also meant commander-in-chief.
All these words died out from the language by now, but the expression dandár survived, which means rearüguar or supplementary force.
From among names of contemporaneous Turkish weapons the ones referring to the offensive of attacking weapons of the cavalry and infantry have survived, such as dzsida [a type of spear], handzsár [short sword], fringia [made of fine steel] and dömöcki [from Damascus] sabre or sword.
The word boncsok and sandjak was rather widespread, but not as military symbols.
Boncsok meant a decoration (made of pearls) for horses, which was put around the neck, and its secondary meaning was that of a military symbol with the tail of the horse.
Sandjak, which originally meant banner, had another meaning: a state administrational unit.
It is striking that the Turkish names of tents, which played a significant role in the period, appeared in sources only insignificant numbers.
The reason for this might have been the following: the word sátor [tent] originating from the times before the Conquest could easily substitute the Turkish word cadir [tent].
The Hungarian word csárda [tsarda] originally referred to a military building, and its source was the Turkish csardak.
The accommodation of a moving army was the konak, from which the word konok [stobborn] might have developed.
Dögönyeg was an implement of punishment, a stick or a leaded whip.
Kalafa was a type of pillory, in which the legs of the punished person were beaten with a stick.
The cuffs on the hands, legs or neck of the convict were called csincsér.
The words korbács [whip], referring to a leather whip with a short handle, and pajzán [playful, frolicsome], which originally meant galley-slave and changed its meaning several times, became widespread in this period.
State administration
The biggest military and state administrational unit of the empire was the vilayet.
This contained several districts, livas, and those included smaller units called nahijes or kazas (judicial districts).
The head of a province was the begler begh, who had the same power as the pasha.
In Hungarian instead of the begler begh the word pasha or basha was used, so the begler beghs of Buda were often called the pasha of Buda or basha of Buda.
The deputy of the governor was the kajmakám or kihája, his representative in the Empire was the kapikihája, his messenger was the csausz.
The leader of the chancellor in the province was called rézefendi, and the inspector of stables was the imrehor.
The Turkish equivalent of the middle unit of state administration (liva) was the sandjak, with the sandjak begh at the lead.
The deputy of the sandjak begh was the alaj begh, who was the leader of the spahis as well as of the sandjaks.
As the higher rank officers were often replaced in the Turkish Empire and it was easy to lose one's post, the word referring to a person deprived of his office was mazur or mazul, and it was widely used in the occupied regions, too.
Matters of everyday life were settled by lower-rank clerks, inspectors, the emins and the basis - in Hungarian the emings and the bashas.
Estate and financial matters of the province were recorded in the tax book called defter, the head of which was the defterdar.
The greatest burden upon the population of the occupied regions (raja) was the harács tax collected from the non-Muslim inhabitants.
When settling their problems they had to give baksis.
In the course of paying taxes to the Turks and trading with them Hungarian people became familiar with Turkish money and their system of measurement.
The value of their money was not the same everywhere, it depended on the region and the age. The values of measures also depended on the material.
The basis of the Turkish monetary system was the small silver money, the akcsa (ospora).
Even smaller and less valuable was the mangur made of copper.
Small change was called para, it was a small metal plate.
The local representative of Turkish jurisdiction was the "Turkish judge", the kadhi, who was also the most important local person in state administration. He was responsible for estates and taxation problems besides other less important duties.
The head of jurisdiction was the highest judge, the kadiasker.
Higher rank kadhis, law experts were the mollas.
Besides the kadhis there were the muftis, whose role was that of a counsellor.
In the bureaucratic administration system of the Turks there were several types of documents in the period.
The best-known ones were the atname [letter of contract at an international level, diploma of inaugurating a sultan], the berat [letter of appointing a sultan, deed of gift], the ferman [the sultan's or other high-rank official's written order signed by the sultan], the bujurdi [high-rank officials' written order], and the teskere [a deed of gift for service estates or other estates].
The legal decision issued by the kadhi was the hücset, and the written resolution of the mufti was called fetva.
The Islamic religion
In Muslim religious practice people uttered the name Allah or Mohammed several times a day in everyday life and in war-cries.
From among the names of fasts and celebrations bajram and ramazam were generally known. The Muslim man who made a pilgrimage to Mecca was called a hadji.
Religion was practised in the mosques, the leading priests of which was the imam. The teacher of the church school near the mosques was the hodja.
The time of the afternoon prayer was called ikindi.
Monks, (in their Persian-Turkish names dervishes) played a very important role in Turkish religious and intellectual life.
In contrast to Muslim Turks, Christian or Jewish people were called gyaur or csifut, and those who converted to Islam were the potors.
Dressing
The Eastern way of dress - which was more colourful and varied than the European way - had a great impact on Hungarian people, who took easily to eastern pomp.
Some of the textile or leather products needed for clothing was imported, and some of it was produced in Hungarian workshops by Turkish, Bosnian or Serb craftsmen, then later Hungarian masters.
The most important textile was the thick aba or aba cloth, which was often used by the army.
A similar thick cloth was the csuha, but in Hungarian sources it referred to the apron made from it.
A thinner linen was the bagazia, the muszuly and the futa.
Even thinner materials were the bulya and the karman-patyolat.
The word pamut referred to the source, cotton.
Turkish seamstresses and embroiders, the bulyas played an important role in the spread of beautiful Turkish embroidery.
Kerchiefs woven with gold threads or decorated with embroidery were the teszteménys.
The famous colourful woven Turkish carpets, blankets and pillows became very popular, especially in Transylvania.
These were the kilim-carpets, sofa-rugs and pillows and the kelevet-carpets and pillows.
The impact of Turkish clothing was the greatest in upper clothing.
The most popular item of all was the Turkish dolmány [dolman], which was a tight, decorated coat.
Among poorer people the csuha - an apron made from thick cloth - was the most popular item of clothing.
The Turkish kaftan was introduced into Hungary through diplomacy, which was slightly modified.
The predecessor of the zubbony [a kind of jacket] was brought into the country in this period, but then it was just a gown, a kabátka [short coat].
The pocket - which was a separate item of clothing originally - was added to the breast part of the upper clothes in this age.
The kalpag [a kind of hat] - which had a fur lining - became very popular together with the dolman, and they quickly became necessary items in Hungarian clothing. However, turbans were never worn by Hungarian men.
The ancient Turkish leather art developed under the strong influence of Persian art, and reached its highest level during the 16-17th centuries.
At first Turkish leather products reached Hungary through trade or as plunder, but later they were made in local workshops as well.
The masters of leather products were Turks from the Balkans or the Rac-s.
This is why there are so many loan words in Hungarian which came through Slav transmission.
The mementoes from the developed Turkish leather industry are the words bagaria and szattyán [names of leather types].
The names of Turkish shoemakers and tanners were preserved in the word tabak or tabakos, and the names of tanning workshops were preserved in the name Tabán, which refers to a certain part of a city.
Two special types of shoes originate from the Turks, the long boots and the slippers.
Although csizma [boots] slipped into the language through Slav mediation (csizmadia), it is most likely that the fashion of these eastern boots can be traced back to the Turkish age.
The glue of shoe/boot makers was the csiriz.
Eating
Another field where Turkish influence was quite significant was eating.
Some food, which we consider typical Hungarian food, for example, stuffing made of rice and meat, stew-type meat dishes, dried noodles, were adopted from the Turks, partly directly, partly with Balkan Slav mediation.
Tarhonya and pite are such Turkish noodles.
The name of the latter is of Greek origin, but it became popular in the age of Turkish occupation.
The dried bread called peszmet was once the food of sailors.
From among meat dishes the pasztormány was a dried, smoked meat, or the beef-cattle it was made of.
The word kaszab [butcher] was also used as family name, and it still exists in Hungarian as a verb.
Because of the lack of ingredients for Turkish fruit drinks - orange, lemon and other eastern fruits - only the serbet was known, although it was usually imported.
Coffee, however, became very popular.
As a valuable imported product, it was at first available only for people in high-society.
However, it spread so fast that neither its high price nor measures of prohibition could hold back its popularity.
During the Turkish occupation different plants entered the country.
The most important one was tobacco.
The German word tabak and the Hungarian dohány of Turkish origin appeared at the same time in the Hungarian language, but the habit of smoking was undoubtedly spread by the Turks, as growing tobacco also started under Slav and Turkish influence.
Smoking was rejected by both the state and the church, without success.
From among fruits some preserved the Turkish origin in the name: kajszibarack and kálmánkörte [apricot and pear]. The original form of the latter was kármánkörte, and the first part karaman comes from Turkish folk language.
Presumably spices and other herbs also reached the country, but their Turkish names were not adopted, only the first part refer to their origin (for example, Turkish wheat, Turkish peas, Turkish beans, Turkish pepper, Turkish hazelnut, Turkish millet).
It is also surprising that there are no Turkish names for flowers. The name of the most typical Turkish flower, tulip is of Turkish-Persian origin and it is the same as the word for turban, but it came to Hungary through European mediation.
The other typical Turkish flower, carnation, became popular under the name Turkish carnation.
Besides the two important luxury products, coffee and tobacco, Hungarians became familiar with the drug called maszlag through Turkish mediation.
The Turkish name for opium became well-known through Miklós Zrínyi's work, in which he called it áfium.
The word mámoros [intoxicated] was used in connection with smoking, alcoholic drinks and drugs.
Turkish baking and cooking utensils were usually made of copper.
The typical utensil for cooking in the open air, the stew-pot (in the name of which there is the Turkish word for copper), was also made of copper.
Baking plates were copper plates, but in finer versions they were made of silver or gold.
The same is true for ibrik.
Findzsa - which was adopted together with coffee - was made of porcelain.
Wheat, cereals and rice were kept in sacks, or harár in Turkish.
The hombár, a chest made of planks, was used for storing or carrying grain.
The szofra, a suitcase for carrying food for a journey, was used as a tablecloth, when it was open.
The Turkish name for chests or baskets used for storing and carrying clothes, food or money was szepet.
LITERATURE
HUNGARIAN LITERATURE
The changes in literature after 1526
The decline of monastic culture
The system of institutions of Hungarian culture underwent a significant change in the 16th century.
At first it was a slow process, but in the middle of the century it accelerated.
The pioneers of Hungarian literature - those intellectuals who created Erasmist, Protestant, vagant or court literature - started their ways from this changing medieval system of institutions.
Hungarian literature was limited mainly to the monasteries until 1526.
After the decline of the medieval state the decline of monasteries became an irreversible process.
However, some of the monasteries managed to survive: five or six monasteries of the Paulian order, Franciscan monasteries throughout the country, so they remained important intellectual centers both in Transylvania and in the occupied regions.
Nunneries were deserted, although the Clarissans of Nagyszombat and Pozsony survived these times - that is why several Hungarian codices also survived destruction.
The new centers of royal and ecclesiastic patrons
The Turks destroyed Buda in 1526 and in 1541 they occupied it.
Between these two dates Hungary had two kings: Ferdinand Habsburg and János Szapolyai.
There was no real court - similar to that of King Matthias - at that time, and the lack of this lead to the slow decline of culture.
This process, however, was quite ambiguous.
In the chaotic political situation the role of intellectuals became more significant, since there were two royal courts and two royal chancelleries at the same time, and neither ruler could do without educated humanist and juristic intellectuals.
In 1543 Esztergom fell, and the archbishopric district had to flee to Nagyszombat.
The decline of bishopric residences, chapters and monasteries resulted in the collapse of credible places, so the centers of medieval literacy slowly disappeared.
However, there were some exceptions.
For example, the chapter of Gyõr managed to survive the war and it was able to preserve humanist traditions under the guidance of Bishop Demeter Náprágyi.
So not all the political and ecclesiastical centers - together with royal and ecclesiastic patrons - were demolished.
The necessary changes resulted in the increase of the cultural role of Pozsony, Nagyszombat and Transylvania.
The royal court had already fled to Pozsony in 1526.
As the dignitaries of ecclesiastic districts occupied by the Turks also fled there, it also helped the second flourishing of humanist literature.
It was not by chance that the Hungarian counter-reformation later started in Nagyszombat.
The dignitary patrons of literature
During the great political and religious movements the court of dignitaries were havens for literature.
The main patrons of Hungarian literature became landowners, who possessed huge estates in the country.
The boom in political and religious life, the modernisation of culture and education would have been impossible without dignitary patrons.
Cultural centres were established by Tamás Nádasdy in Sárvár-Újsziget, by the Batthyánys in Németújvár, by the Perényis in Sárospatak, by Zsigmond Rákóczi in Vizsoly and by Zsigmond János, Transylvanian principal in Gyulafehérvár.
The intellectuals of the age found their homes in the courts of dignitaries. Usually the patrons paid for their studies at foreign universities - as there was no university in Hungary, they also supported the publishing of books and left their marks on the spirit of literature.
Towns and market towns also played an important role in the change of literature: Lõcse, Bártfa, Sopron, Debrecen, Kolozsvár, and even Tolna and Ráckeve in the occupied regions brought up and supported their own bourgeois and peasant-bourgeois intellectuals.
The spread of the Hungarian language
At around 1526 the use of the Hungarian language became more and more frequent in correspondence: missiles and sometimes charters were composed in Hungarian, and the Latin language was gradually pushed back.
The reasons for this change are not at all clear.
National feeling inspired by Turkish rule, the development of public education, the programme of the renewal of religion in the vernacular and the role of women who wanted to study but did not speak Latin might all have been significant factors in this process.
At the end of the 16th century Hungarian letters were full of Latinisms, but in the beginning the direct expressions, similes and proverbs of the spoken language had been in use.
This had an impact on the language of literature as well.
Nuns, who left their orders taught young girls how to write.
Clerks who were familiar with letter writing were highly respected by not only illiterate noblemen but also the Turks. In the 16th century the pashas of Buda corresponded with their Christian enemy, including the Habsburg court, in Hungarian.
Book printing
The bookprinter as a mediator between the patron and literature
The spread of the Hungarian language in the field of communication, entertainment, education and religious life developed in parallel with the rapid spread of book printing.
The richest patrons of literature were founding printing houses in royal Hungary and Transylvania one after the other (there were no printing houses in the territories occupied by the Turks).
Besides the patron and the writer attention also must be paid to the printer in the system of institutions of literature.
Tamás Nádasdy invited Benedek Abádi to his estate in Sárvár-Újsziget to help him print the first book in the Hungarian language: János Sylvester's New Testament (1541).
The writer and the printer were frequently one and the same: Péter Bornemisza founded his own moving printing house in royal Hungary to publish his own works. In royal Hungary one needed a privilege to run a printing house, but in Transylvania permission was not needed.
Most Hungarian printing houses served the interests of the Reformation.
The printing house founded by Gáspár Heltai and Georg Hoffgreff in 1550 in Kolozsvár was also a successful business, thanks to the publishing of Hungarian literary works and translations.
The spread of literary texts
Paper was in general use for printing literary texts by this time, and was much cheaper than parchment (one twenty-first), although it was quite difficult to obtain.
Usually it was imported - from German or Polish paper mills. Water marks referred to the place of origin.
The first Hungarian paper mill was founded in Lõcse at the beginning of the 16th century.
Only a few manuscripts survived from the 16th century.
A proof-sheet was made of the setting, and the author corrected the mistakes on the proof-sheet.
There were professional proof-readers: sometimes János Sylvester and Albert Szenci Molnár also worked as a proof-reader.
For example, Gáspár Károlyi's own proof-sheet was preserved, which he made for the Vizsoly Bible.
Printing did not completely retard hand-written books, as texts were often spread in hand-written manuscripts.
A lot of manuscripts survived which did not appear in printing for various reasons.
For example, the majority of love poems of the period survived only in manuscript songbooks.
Although the printing of literary works on the topic of love was not officially banned, the churches - both the Protestant and the Catholic - fought against it, and the majority of printing houses were under the strict supervision of the church.
Printed books
The spiritual development of the 16th century was closely related to Johann Gutenberg's 15th-century invention, the type-founding and the press, even in Hungary.
At first the printed materials imitated codices, the decorated manuscript models of the previous century.
After 1550, however, practical solutions were preferred, so the printed book became different from the manuscripts.
Printing, make-up, decoration and illustration developed in a totally new direction.
There were various sizes of books, ranging from huge, folio-size to tiny, hand-size books.
The complex, hierarchic typography reflected the structure of the text following medieval, scholastic patterns.
Paragraphs were first used in this period.
The cover-page became much simpler, the type-setting was easy to survey, quick orientation was helped by headings, and there were marginalia at the edge of the pages.
Instead of page numbers there were gathering marks, and guard words ensured the proper order of the pages.
In Transylvania there were book binding workshops near printing houses, and these usually reflected the taste of German book printers.
Book trade and libraries
The growing interest in books brought about a slow development in the book trade.
Noblemen and Transylvanian principals, who owned significant collections of books, often entrusted students studying at foreign universities with buying books for them.
Nevertheless official book agents and book sellers also appeared in Hungary, and in most cases they were responsible for binding the books as well.
There are some book seller's catalogues from the 16th century (for example, the one which enlisted Hans Gallen's 604-item stock from 1583).
The most significant collections were private ones.
For example, Boldizsár Batthány, who had a modern European education, collected contemporary literary pieces, including Spanish romances.
The Hungarian humanist scientists of the century or those living in Hungary - for example, Hans Dernschwam, János Zsámboky and András Dudith - also had huge libraries, and they bought these books abroad.
Private collections of prelates were usually much bigger than those of ecclesiastic libraries. The books of Miklós Oláh, Miklós Telegdi, Zakariás Mossóczi or Demeter Náprágyi became the basis of later ecclesiastic collections.
Smaller libraries of intellectuals and noblemen were also very important.
Collections destroyed in wars were mentioned in inventories and notes of the possessors.
The system of education
The language of schools, education and science was still Latin at this time.
The renaissance curriculum was compiled according to medieval principles, the so-called seven free arts (septem artes liberales).
At lower levels the subjects of the trivium were taught: grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics (that is logic).
At higher levels the subjects of the quadrivium (arithmetics, geometry, astronomy and music) were taught in the elite schools.
In the process of education - mainly at primary and secondary levels - the mother tongue played a very important role.
Hungarian examples helped in the understanding of the Latin texts in school books.
So did multi-lingual collections of dialogues written for children.
Students memorised several Latin-Hungarian word pairs day by day, and this process was helped by nomenclatures, that is dictionaries, appearing in print.
The curriculum, which was reformed according to humanist principles, aimed at the acquisition of humanities - studia humanitatis.
The Hungarian translations of Aesop's fables, Cato's sentences or Horace's odes reflect the demands of schools for a high-level education of grammar and rethoric.
Humanist intellectuals
Besides the churches of towns and market towns, parish schools had also been functioning since the Middle Ages.
In the age of Reformation, when towns changed their religion, these schools often became the centres of new religious ideas and new Protestant culture.
In the schools of Sárospatak, Kolozsvár, Debrecen and Tolna (in the occupied region) the teachers were outstanding Protestant humanists, who were rather significant in Hungarian literature as well.
Besides the chapters which survived, there were chapter schools, where the new curriculum was taught, such as the Nagyszombat school reorganised by Archbishop Miklós Oláh.
There were other forums of primary and secondary education: the children of Hungarian noblemen and border-fortress officers studied in Viennese provincial schools.
The schools in towns became theatrical centres, too: the first Hungarian schools dramas were performed here.
Some of the noblemen and dignitaries sent their children to a neighbouring castle or mansion to study instead of a school.
At the court of the Batthánys there were several masteres at the same time.
However, there were no universities in Hungary.
Students went to the universities of Krakow, Vienna, Padua, then Wittenberg and Heidelberg. This was called peregrination.
The result of going to foreign universities was that the students had direct connections with the outstanding personalities of the age, they got to know the latest results of scientific research and thus could spread them in Hungary.
The highest form of educating Hungarian intellectuals and scientific and religious life was peregrination.
Travelling students - visiting one town after another - collected their experiences in travel descriptions and diaries.
The most successful and the best European travel description in Hungarian was written by Márton Csombor Szepsi: Europica varietas, Kassa, 1620.
Students went to study and discover the world: they enrolled in various European universities, they wanted to listen to the lectures of famous professors, since for most of them this was the only possibility to travel in their lives.
Hungarian erasmists
Erasmism
In the decades around the defeat at Mohács the uncrowned king of humanists in Europe was Erasmus of Rotterdam.
Hungarian intellectuals read and studied his work even before Mohács - they were the first generation of Hungarian Erasmists.
The master added the principles of devotio moderna to humanism and he created a basically new, honest and intimate Christian way of life.
At the centre of this was the New Testament published from original Greek text sources.
Erasmus often rejected the official teachings of the Catholic church, but he never joined the Reformation.
Although he did not write a word in any vulgar language, he encouraged the translation of the Bible into the mother tongue as well as its proliferation.
The goal of the second group of Hungarian Erasmists (after Mohács) was to create a Hungarian Bible which would be spread among a wide range of people.
The aims of the Hungarian Erasmists were identical with those of the reformists in several cases, but they remained loyal to Catholicism.
National literature
The works of Hungarian Erasmists were the outcome of a unified, well-organised literary conception, and this is why they are different from the works of monastic literature.
First they wanted to make the Hungarian language suitable for interpreting the Bible, and only then did they intend to translate the Holy Scripture into Hungarian.
They wanted to create an educated Hungarian literary language according to rhetorical principles.
They therefore started to study Hungarian linguistics.
Their literary programme brought about the renewal of national feeling, and during their work to protect and create the language they were the first to discover and appreciate the beauties of the Hungarian tongue.
Their literary organising work remained outside the conflict between different religions: Reformation did not use the Erasmist Bible translations.
However, their activity was not isolated from other literary activities of the period.
The Protestant humanist János Baranyai Decsi, who translated Erasmus's collection of proverbs into Hungarian, was the later follower of the Erasmists in respect to the aim to reform the language.
Benedek Komjáti
Benedek Komjáti was Erasmus's follower, and the first to write in Hungarian.
In 1533 he published the Hungarian translation of St Paul's letters in Krakow with the support of the Perényi family. This was the first printed book in Hungarian.
He did not mention Erasmus by name but in fact he worked from Erasmus's translation, adopted the introductions in front of the letters from him, and also incorporated Erasmus's commentaries into his text.
These were introductory steps, but Komjáti's literary consciousness was deep.
Gábor Pesti
The real establishment of Erasmist literary programme was Gábor Pesti's merit, who belonged to the intellectual circles of the royal chancellery.
He studied at the university of Vienna, and had very good relations with the Erasmist, anti-Lutheran group of professors.
In Vienna in 1536 he published two books in Hungarian: Aesops' fables and the New Testament.
Two years later he published Gábor Pesti's six-language dictionary there.
He interpreted the ancient Aesop's fables in a simple, clear Hungarian language.
His basic aim was to enrich the language and teach moral lessons to people.
At the same time he was aware of the fact that the charm of the tales pleased the readers.
The Erasmist Gábor Pesti used the same methods when he studied the Bible.
The similarities of the Holy Scripture and the ancient works could have been proved by the fact that both used fables.
János Sylvester
The most talented representative of Hungarian Erasmism was János Sylvester (1504-1552).
He was the founder of Hungarian linguistic and literary studies.
From 1534 he led the Bible translating workshop together with the printers Johannes Strutius and Benedek Abádi. The workshop functioned at Tamás Nádasy's estate in Sárvár-Újsziget.
Simultaneously with the translation of the New Testament he studied the grammatical structure of the Hungarian language.
His work entitled Grammatica hungarolatina appeared in 1539, this was the first systematic Hungarian grammar.
When describing the sound system of Hungarian he was able to use his knowledge of Hebrew.
His complete New Testament published in 1541 followed Erasmus's translations and commentaries.
During translation Sylvester recognised that the Hungarian language is suitable for rhythmic poetry: the summary of the books of the New Testament was compiled in distich.
The book contains an essay on words with several meanings, in which Hungarian love songs are mentioned for the first time.
It was also the first description of the essence of Hungarian poetry.
Hungarian literature in the service of the reformation
The spread of Reformation in Hungary
There is little information about the beginning of the spread of the Reformation in Hungary.
It is certain, though, that it began to spread before 1526 among the circles of the royal court - Louis II and his wife were accused of supporting Luther.
Later Maximilian (Habsburg) I was also interested in Protestantism.
Some of the humanists of the Jagello age liked Luther's ideas, and so did some of the members of the second generation of Hungarian Erasmists, such as Queen Maria's chaplain, János Heckel.
The new bourgeoisie of towns, who wanted independence, also found the new ideas challenging.
The German population of the country stood by the Lutheran Reformation unanimously, and through this the reform of religion was complete for them.
The Transylvanian Saxons were led to the camp of Protestants by Johannes Honterus, while the Northern Hungarian Germans were led there by Leonhard Stöckel.
Many of the Observant Franciscans saw the sins of dignitaries and the church as the causes of the downfall of the country, even before 1514.
This Franciscan radicalism also encouraged the success of the Reformation.
The Carthausian Anonym, for example, who wrote the Érdy codex, wanted to stop the spread of 'lethal Lutheran herecy' in monastic orders with his work.
The ambition of noblemen to possess more and more estates also contributed to the dissection of Catholic institutions.
The territorial division of the Reformation
By the end of the second half of the century the divided country was a colourful picture concerning religion.
In the territory of royal Hungary Catholicism was pushed back to the region of Pozsony.
The original unity of Protestantism was soon broken, and the reformists (Calvinists) called sacramentarians pressed forward in Northern Hungary. They had some arguments with the Lutherans in regard to receiving the sacrament.
Reformists dominated even in the occupied regions.
Their temples were deprived of the pictures of the saints - their destroying of pictures being in harmony with Islam.
After the murder of György Fráter (1551) Catholicism was pushed out of Transylvania, which sought to be independent, although it never ceased to exist.
During the reign of János II (János Zsigmond) the Reformation not only spread but also gradually became radical: the Unitarians appeared, who rejected the dogma of the Holy Trinity.
Their most outstanding representative was Bishop Ferenc Dávid, who stood out from among the Unitarians with his radical views: he refused to praise Christ.
He was imprisoned in 1579 because of his views, and died there in the very same year.
Kolozsvár soon became a Unitarian town.
At the end of the 1570s the Unitarian church split into two parts: from its radical wing the sect of the Sabbatists was formed.
For many decades Transylvania provided a haven for refugees, who had to flee because of their religious views (even in Protestant countries). It was unique in Europe.
The heretic religious philosophers who settled here, such as Jacobus Palaeologus, Christian Francken and Matthias Vehe-Glirius, were able to teach in the Unitarian college, and write in a peaceful environment as well as spread their ideas relatively freely. Thus they left their marks on the intellectual life of Transylvania.
The first Hungarian Protestants
The literary programme of the Hungarian reformers to develop the mother tongue was subordinated to religious conflict from the very beginning.
The first Hungarian Protestant writers - for example, Mátyás Dévai Bíró and Imre Ozorai - actively fought against Catholic ceremonies and the Latin language used in the church, which was a tool to deceive the people, in their view.
They forced their dispute partners to use the mother tongue, as it is shown in Mihály Sztárai's plays and Unitarian dispute dramas.
Abstract theological disputes were performed before common people, and the mother tongue was developed for religious purposes.
Their basic interest was to make themselves understood, so they wrote in a clear and simple style.
There were a lot of educated Protestant humanists among them, who studied at foreign universities. They used their knowledge on ancient Latin and Greek literature for moral and religious purposes.
In principle the emphasis was put on moral education, and they rejected the role of literature to provide pleasure.
In reality, however, a lot of high-standard literary works were created 'in the name of the Reformation'.
The main genres of the literature of the Reformation
Congregation songs
The Protestants soon realised that Hungarian congregation songs made people enthusiastic and had the force to unite them.
Several types of song collections were compiled.
These made the songs necessary in religious life available for a broad range of people, selected and regulated ecclesiastic genres, excluding everything they considered objectionable from theological or moral points of view.
Although masses were abolished, they needed liturgical and service songs.
The graduale collected these.
Singing religious songs outside the service was even more popular: communal songs were collected in congregation song books.
Protestant identity was best expressed by psalms from the Old Testament.
Hungarian composers made their psalm paraphrases one after the other following the patterns of the most significant psalm interpreters of Western Europe, such as Theodore de Beze and George Buchanan. Protestant congregations all tried to compile their own complete books of psalms.
Biblical stories
There was a separate type of Protestant song collection, in which long preaching songs devoted to private reading and narrative religious (Biblical stories and other) works were collected. A nice example of this is the Hoffgreff song book (Kolozsvár, 1554-1555).
Educational songs which preached the ideas of the Reformation with great enthusiasm and prophetic zeal were also included in them.
Their preacher authors saw the causes of the downfall of the country and success of Turkish conquest in the widely spread sins.
The historical picture of Hungarian Protestantism was formed by Hungarian students studying at foreign universities according to the so-called Wittenberg historical view based on Luther's and especially Philip Melanchthon's points of view originating from medieval principles.
According to the Wittenberg view the end of the world was quite close, and the Turks coming in the name of the Antichrist were God's punishment for the sins of the world.
András Farkas's song written in 1538 about the Hungarian and Jewish nations drew a parallel between the history of the Old Testament Jews and that of the Hungarians. He tried to prove that as the destruction of the Jewish people was a consequence of their sins, God punished the Hungarians in the same way.
This Jewish-Hungarian parallel in fate became very popular in Hungarian literature. It appeared in Miklós Zrínyi's epic poem and Kölcsey's Hymn.
The same thought was represented by András Szkárosi Horváth with even greater poetic force.
In his poem about malediction he called down Moses' Biblical curse upon the sinful Hungarians.
The Wittenberg historical view applied to the Hungarian situation had a great impact on the anti-Turkish propaganda of the 16-17th century.
Collections of preaching and Bible translations
A great part of the prosaic works of the Reformation included collections of preaching, that is postillas.
They reached their educational goals through examples used in preaching - these often turned into enjoyable stories or anecdotes.
Another part of Protestant prosaic literature included polemic, disputing works.
However, the greatest impact on Hungarian literary language was made by Bible translations.
Besides Gáspár Károlyi several anonymous translators worked on the Vizsoly Bible (1590).
These translated texts - in spite of the revisions - played a significant role in Hungarian literature until the 20th century.
In all probability Péter Melius Juhász also translated the whole New Testament, but it was lost.
Miklós Bogáti Fazekas wrote a special paraphrase about the Song of Songs, which used a lot of tools of Hungarian love poetry.
There was whole group of Bible translators around the Heltai press in Kolozsvár, but their work remained incomplete.
Gáspár Heltai
One of the most outstanding and talented figures of 16th-century Hungarian prosaic literature was Gáspár Heltai. His origin was German, his original name was Kaspar Helth, and he was born into a Transylvanian Saxon family.
As a printer from Kolozsvár he soon became one of the most respected writers of Hungarian prose.
The Hungarian of his 'Dialogue on the Dangers of Drunkenness and Living in Luxurious Abundance' (1552) was sometimes inaccurate, but it was compensated by the liveliness of his dialogues and the richness of the language.
His One Hundred Fables (1556) was based on Aesop's tales and it gives the original atmosphere of the German source.
In contrast to Gábor Pesti's straight-forward but rigorous tales Heltai's sentences are still lively, fresh and humorous even today.
His book entitled 'The Net' is an adaptation of the adventurous story of inquisition about a Spanish monk, who left his convent.
He was rather significant as a historiographer, too. His Chronicle appeared in 1575 - after his death. He rewrote Bonfini's work and adapted it to the Hungarian situation.
This book was written in the Matthias-cult. Heltai was the first to apply the moral Protestant historical view to Hungarian history.
Péter Bornemisza
Besides Gáspár Heltai, Péter Bornemisza was one of the most outstanding writers of 16th-century Hungarian prose.
His huge life-work served the Reformation.
His talent as a writer was reflected in each of his words - his works are enjoyable even today.
As a poet, however, he did not write much, but his farewell poem I am Miserable, written in the 1550s, is one of the briefest pieces of Hungarian secular poetry.
During his studies in Vienna his professor, Georgius Tanner, gave him Sophocles' Electra, which he translated into Hungarian, and performed together with his fellow-students (Vienna, 1558).
This play was the clearest manifestation of Protestant humanism.
Bornemisza not only closely followed the development of Hungarian literature, but wanted to make it richer still following the examples of ancient classical authors, such as Cicero, and contemporary nations.
The basic idea of his work is completely Protestant: with the fall of Aigisthos and Kluthaimnes he preached against murder and lechery, the most serious sins against God. In contrast, he accepted killing a tyrant.
Similarly to Gáspár Heltai, he totally rewrote and modernised his source.
He transformed the choir of the Greek drama into a single character.
He also created a new figure, whose name is Parasitus. He is the prototype of later court intriguers.
Péter Bornemisza's new book, Devilish ghosts was published in 1578, which made a great impact on contemporary readers, and it is probably one of the most interesting writing from the 16th century.
According to sources in Wittenberg Bornemisza collected most of the devil stories of world history, emphasising the immense evil in the Devil, who tempts people to lechery, and the defenselessness of man.
He openly talked about the sexual sins of the period, including his own and those of the dignitaries (for example, the Balassi, the Perényi or the Török family).
The appearance of the Devilish Ghosts was a great scandal.
This book is a great source of ethnographic and cultural historical data.
We can read the first known charming prayers - containing extremely archaic and pagan elements. Bornemisza heard these prayers from a woman called Mrs Benedek Tardoskeddi Szerencse.
Charming prayers were rejected by official church forums.
Similar folklore texts were found in living folk traditions in great numbers by the ethnographers of our century.
Péter Bornemisza recorded two trufas as well, the hero of which was the well-known jester, Balázs Trágár of Eulenspiegel type.
From the Devilish Ghosts it clearly turns out that not only Salamon's and Markalf's jokes were spread by word of mouth but also the stories of Balázs Trágár, sometimes they were written down.
Albert Szenci Molnár
Albert Szenci Molnár was the one who completed the literary programme of Protestant humanism.
He spent almost all his life abroad, in German-speaking regions, but his activities served only the Hungarian Reformation and science.
His linguistic and literary works were in a harmonious unity together with his theological works.
His Hungarian Grammar (Hanau, 1610) and his popular Latin-Hungarian, Hungarian-Latin Dictionary (Nürnberg, 1604; Hanau, 1611; Heidelberg, 1621) brought Hungarian science up to a European level, and gave Hungarian literary language a firm basis.
He was the one who gave the Calvinist church a complete book of psalms.
The Psalterium ungaricum (Herbron, 1607) is the form-perfect interpretation of Huguenot psalms.
The 130 different verse structures reflected French melodies - which sounded strange to Hungarian people - in Hungarian.
He was also very good at Bible studies, theology and philosophy, sometimes he had time for poetic games (Lusus poetici, Hanau, 1614) and picture poems.
Poetry, folk culture
The place of poetry in literature
One of the most interesting sections of old Hungarian literature contains genres and works of art, which were written for a wide range of people regardless of their religion, social level and education.
This public literature was not at all homogenous, there were several types of authors and readers.
The common feature of popular literary genres was comprehensibility.
This type of literature was not distinct from the others: in Protestant preaching, dialogues and different occasional poems there was a certain openness towards profane literature.
Funny wedding songs performed at wedding ceremonies, or the christening songs preserved this double genre - secular and ecclesiastical - at least for a certain period of time.
From the end of the 16th century Protestant literature became more and more gloomy: 'practical' jokes were no longer understood nor tolerated.
The elements of common poetry were integrated into court culture only in a modified, noble form. A nice example is Balassi's folk figures in his Fine Hungarian Comedy, or his 'latrican' poem about 'Viennese flowers'.
In these the court poet expressed his superiority over the commonplace.
Vagant poetry
We do not know any real, authentic 16th-century folk songs: nobody wanted to record the pieces of illiterate, oral tradition song poetry at that time.
However, we have some information about certain pieces of the repertoire of travelling students, called 'violinists' - this is the borderline between literacy and illiterate poetry.
Hungarian equivalents of vagant poetry, which flourished throughout Europe, were performed everywhere, including pubs and noble courts.
Love songs, dance songs and dance words, that is satirical verses, were sung according to the taste of the audience.
The Mischievous Song, which was preserved in the Job codex of Fanchali, was not a real poem, but a series of such: it collected the vulgar topics and genres of the anonymous minstrels of the century. These songs are about robbery, drunkenness, making fun of a spinster, a girl in love, 'breaking the pot' - that is rape -, a love affair of a noble lady with her own coachman. These 'mischievous' or obscene scenes follow one another in this special poem, which can be related to the oldest generation of folk songs.
Historical songs
A more educated group of minstrels was gradually becoming distinct from folk 'entertainers'. They turned away from oral literary forms towards literacy.
Although they also called themselves 'violinists' or 'luters' like their less sophisticated colleagues, they looked down on pub musicians.
The poetic means of illiterate poetry and the violinist behaviour itself often appeared in their poetry in ironic forms.
Instead of light-minded topics they chose historical ones.
They tried to defend their poems from unauthorised users with the aid of acrostics and colophons.
They were the authors of historical songs.
The oldest historical song is from King Matthias' time, it is Szabács's struggle.
The song about the occupation of a fortress near the river Száva on 15 February, 1457 had quite a modern rhyme pattern - several scholars have doubts about its authenticity.
Demeter Csáti describes The Acquisition of Pannonia in his poem which was rich in archaic alliterations. He was a Franciscan monk from the beginning of the 16th century.
Mihály Szilágyi's and László Hagymási's stories were preserved in folk ballads and in the poetry of the neighbouring nations.
Péter Ilosvai Selymes wrote several historical songs, but he became famous for a single poem about Miklós Toldi adapted by János Arany.
The great master of this genre was undoubtedly Sebestyén Tinódi.
Today he would be a war correspondent: he was present on the battlefields of Turkish-Hungarian conflicts and informed people about the latest news walking from fortress to fortress.
He recited his poems himself, composing music for them and singing them, encouraging warriors throughout the country.
His songs were collected in a book, which was published in his life by Georg Hoffgreff in Kolozsvár.
The 1554 Cronica - as it is shown in the title - was a verse history in Hungarian. It was highly respected, similarly to humanist historiography. Tinódi considered communicating reality more important than fiction and decorative poetry.
Humanists acknowledged his merits as a historiographer. János Zsámboki translated his poem about the battle for the fortress of Eger into Latin.
Data proving the historic authenticity of Tinódi's poems turns up even today.
Ferenc Wathay
Ferenc Wathay lived and worked at the turn of the 16th-17th centuries.
He acquired his literary skills as a border fortress soldier.
His life was the typical life of soldier. He was captured by the Turks in Székesfehérvár during the 1602 siege.
He was imprisoned in the fortress of Galata in Constantinople for years.
In the prison he compiled a book of songs from his own poems and also wrote his biography.
He knew Balassi's poetry without experiencing courtly love.
He wrote Protestant Bible stories and religious songs, but the majority of his works were historical songs, soldiers' songs and lyrical pieces - related to the popular love songs of manuscripts - written in Tinódi's style.
His most beautiful poem is the nightingale song to his wife who was in far-away Hungary. This poem contains elements from prisoners' songs known from folk song collections.
He decorated his manuscript with hand-painted, naive illustrations.
We can recognise the impact of Turkish miniature painting in these touching water-colours.
The Wathay song book is a summary of 16th-century communal poetry.
This culture was related to the vernacular programme of Protestantism, but it barely reached humanist or court spheres.
In the 17th century several more modern means were used to form public opinion.
The place of historical songs was taken by newspapers and political publicism, and baroque epic poems.
Elite poetry, court culture
The birth of court culture
National language was consciously turned into a literary language by court poets.
The theory and practice of writing songs in the language of common people was the merit of the Middle Ages, not of the Renaissance. Court love poetry was already flourishing in the 11-13th centuries in Provansal, Toscan and Sicilian courts.
In the age of Dante court poetry was called 'the sweet, new style' (dolce stil nuovo).
The innovations of this style were the topic of love and the court cult of women, and 'sweet' meant the rhetoric sophistication of the language, as Dante put it 'excellent vernacular'.
Balassi and his students compiled a homogenous literary programme from the topic of love and the desire to elaborate the vernacular. This programme was put into reality - thanks to Balassi's extraordinary talent.
Love stories
At the same time as Bálint Balassi's appearance - probably under his and his poet friends' influence - love stories in verse became very popular by the last third of the 16th century.
They appeared in paperback, and people read them until they were threadbare.
The poet of Euralius and Lucretia, written in Sárospatak in 1577, was unknown.
The author, the Anonym of Patak, adapted a Latin erotic short story in the style of Hungarian court poetry.
The poetic language of the work is so similar to that of Balassi's court love poetry that many people think Balassi himself must have written it.
Balassi created the Balassi verse using the 19-syllable Lucretia line.
The most beautiful example of love stories is Albert Gergei's Argir.
This work of art was the source of Mihály Vörösmarty's Csongor and Tünde.
The importance of the poem describing the adventure of the prince and the fairy in the real world and in the fairy world is that it is free from every kind of moralising element: it is a clear fairy tale.
The folkloric and mythic motives of the poem fit into the conception of court love: Argir and the fairy's love dialogues are written in Balassi's poetic language.
Albert Gergei's Argir is one of the greatest myths of the history of old Hungarian literature.
The author claimed that he translated the poem from 'an Italian chronicle', but it has not been found so far.
All the efforts to try and find the plot of the poem in the world's tale folklore and European literature have failed.
There are many arguments for antique Greek, Eastern and Celtic origin, but we do not know any text that contains all the main elements of Agril's plot.
Bálint Balassi
Bálint Balassi's importance
Balassi was the founder of Hungarian love poetry and the first great figure of individual religious poetry.
He was known for the latter one for a long time, since only the religious verses appeared in print long after his death.
His love poems were discovered at the end of the last century in the so-called Balassi codex, which - probably - contains the fragments of 'A Book Written with his Own Hands'.
The 17th-century unknown copier introduced this piece of art with the following words: "Here come Bálint Balassi's kölem-kölem type love songs, some of which praise God or warriors".
Balassi was the educated representative of Renaissance poetry: the structure of individual poems within the closed composition of the volume was sophisticated.
He renewed the verse form (Balassi verse).
During his career the text and the melody were separated: his early poems were still songs with musical notations - at the end of his life he left these.
Balassi's innovation in genre was the court play: the Fine Hungarian Comedy, the complete text of this play was discovered only in the 1950s.
In all probability he was the central figure of the poetic academy which was called 'eight young men', who competed in writing poems in Hungarian.
Balassi's love poetry
Balassi lived a passionate life.
As a poet he must have known contemporary love songs.
His love poems, however, were at first similar to court poetry: the man in love praises his lady as a godess, but their relationship is like a feudal hierarchy.
In this early period he called the women of the poems by her own names, and used false names only later (Anna Losonczy became Julia, another became Calia ir Fulvia).
This gesture shows that Balassi was quite close to the renaissance idea of poetry.
After the adaptation of antique examples (Ovid) and mythic figures (Cupido) the impact of neolatin poetry (Marullus, Angerianus, Joannes Secundus) could be felt.
The renaissance features of his art were represented not only by the use of imitatio.
Another important feature was compiling his poems into a composition.
After the first complete unit (of 33 poems) in the Balassi codex there was a second one, probably planned to be a 33-poem cycle.
The basis of this was Balassi's (Credulud - credible) and Anna's (Julia) love story: the poet described his miserable feelings about a hopeless, Petrarcan love in 25 verses.
(This is called Julia cycle.)
Scholars seemed to have found the fragments of different planned volumes, or at least the possibility of it, in the incomplete life-work, which survived.
His last known composed set of poems was the 'Collection without Title' - which was the only piece written in his own handwriting which survived.
Each piece of the cycle is an epigramme-like brief picture containing a single verse, which is a Balassi verse.
His religious poetry
Both cycles of the Balassi codex contain religious poems - he may have planned a third cycle, containing 33 religious poems.
If this had been written, the introduction of the complete volume would have been the 99-line Three Hymns to the Holy Trinity.
Numbers are symbolic: three means the Holy Trinity, 33 refers to Christ's age and perhaps the age of the poet as well.
Balassi's religious songs can be called supraconfessional (nonsectarian).
The reasons for this were the following facts: the poet changed his religion during his life and the collection of his religious poems was often published by both the Catholic and the Protestant church.
Examining the texts the Protestant features are more dominant: the sources of his psalms were the Latin paraphrases of Theodore de Beze and George Buchanan.
He also used congregational songs as sources, when he referred to his relationship with God as a direct (without a mediator) one.
The gesture of seeking God and belief in God full of doubts and ambiguities seemed very modern, which was the returning motif of Balassi's religious poems.
Fine Hungarian Comedy
Cristoforo Castelletti's Amarilli (1587), an Italian pastorale, was adapted by Balassi (1588) when writing a comedy, which fit in with his love for Anna Losonczy.
(The names of the heroes are Julia and Credulus, the same as in the Julia cycle.)
The end of the play - in contrast to real life - is a happy ending: in the course of adventures and misunderstandings the lovers, who had lost each other and later failed to recognised each other, get married.
This close is a request to Anna and it also connects the play to a humanist conception, according to which honest love ends in marriage.
In the Prologue of the play Balassi summarised his literary conceptions and goals.
Besides the intention to create a new genre, the programme of enriching the Hungarian language also played a significant role.
Unlike Erasmist and Protestant traditions, the topic was not history or religious moralisation, but love.
The choice of topic, which was a typical renaissance one, was very modern, just like the aim of the poet to provide the reader with pleasure and entertainment (besides education).
A Soldier's Song - In laudem confiniorum (The praise of border fortresses)
This poem is a very good example of closed, proportionate structure.
The first (addressing and poetic question) and the last (poetic exclamation and a request for blessing) verse out of the 9 set the work in an ode frame. Right in the middle of this, in the central line of the 5th verse the poet placed his message.
These three verses (first, fifth, last) give the rhetorical frames of the poem, and they embrace 3-3 verses: 2-4 and 6-8. These phases describe the typical scenes of a warrior's life.
Both internal units starts with the appearance of the 'enemy', but while the first part finishes with the peace of the night, the second one is closed with the final peace, death (as the end of the battle).
The even units are vivid, while the odd ones are descriptive - accommodating to the three frame verses.
The first and the last verse are connected from a grammatical point of view as well: both subjects are the second person plural, and the warriors are addressed as 'you'.
In the rest of the verses the subjects are the third person in plural.
With this the poet expresses that he is inside the circle, but for the sake of authenticity he had to write these hymnic, praising words as an outsider.
János Rimay and late Renaissance literature
In the first decades of the 17th century the intellectual face of Europe underwent a serious change.
The contrast between different religions became greater, ideological stands became firmer.
This period was the crisis of the Renaissance.
We can declare without any doubt that the humanist ideal of education did not fit the modern, practical requirements of the age any more.
Bálint Balassi's students and followers tried to save his literary heritage, but they were forced to defend themselves from the strictness of the church.
Balassi's most loyal student was János Rimay.
He was said to be a genius, Balassi asked and took his advice concerning his poems. At that time Rimay was only 10-12 years old.
He tried to preserve the memory of his master in a moving mourning verse cycle, the Balassi epicedium (1596).
This complicated piece introduced Bálint Balassi and his brother, Ferenc - who both died in the 15-year war - as models of Pallas and Mars, that is, culture and valour.
Epicedium, full of references to Homer, has an epic structure, which had a great impact on Miklós Zrínyi.
Rimay collected and wanted to print the complete works of Balassi, but this edition was never published, only the preface is known.
In this Rimay defended his master's love poetry, which - according to Rimay - was the basic condition of establishing a national literary language.
Rimay did not imitate Balassi in his love poems, but used scientific imitatio.
Rimay validated the poetical requirements of humanist literature within the framework of court love (created by Balassi).
This resulted in a new style, in which exaggeration, wit and disharmony dominated over the renaissance order of forms.
This new style was mannerism.
The concepts of the late renaissance literary programme manifested in the last spring of humanism, neostoicism.
This conforming system of thoughts characterised his most beautiful poems written at his son's death.
Rimay corresponded with the founder of this movement, Justus Lipsius, a Dutch philosopher.
Rimay compiled a unique cycle - mixing prose with verse - in the topic of nonsectarist religion and stoic moral.
His poem This World is Like a Flower is the miserable, stoic ironic equivalent of Balassi's Slodier's Song.
He wanted to publish his well-structured collection of poems together with Balassi's religious songs in a single volume, but it was carried out only after his death, regardless of his wishes.
Rimay was involved in intensive literary organising activities.
The authors of court type love poems were organised into a certain poet's group by Bálint Balassi himself (eight young men), and Rimay must have been a member of this group.
Later he organised another unofficial literary group, bearing the name of the God Pallas, from the followers of his master.
He kept in touch with Lipsius' Hungarian followers, he corresponded with the representatives of late humanism and the anti-Reformation, for example, Demeter Náprágyi and Péter Pázmány.
Rimay was the first Hungarian literary critic: in his letter to György Rákóczi he judged András Prágai's stoic dignitary mirror, the Urging Hour of Principals (Bártfa, 1628), according to manierist poetry.
The spread of the anti-Reformation
After the synod of Trident (1564) the dissection of the church was inevitable.
Earlier many people hoped that there might be a reconciliation.
By this time, however, the Catholic church was pushed back in Hungary by the forces of the Reformation.
The Catholic renewal in the 17th century headed by Péter Pázmány started from the centres which had been under Catholic authority all along: Nagyszombat and Pozsony.
Miklós Telegdi - with the school and printing house of Nagyszombat behind him - was successful against Péter Bornemisza.
The real chance for the recatholisation of the country was the settlement of Jesuits.
These educated and devoted warriors for Catholicism tried many times to settle in both royal Hungary and Transylvania and they were able to build up their system of institutions, especially the Jesuit schools.
Their first significant Hungarian representative was István Szántó, who supposedly made a complete Bible translation based on the Vulgata - but the manuscript was unfortunately lost.
Thus the task of Catholic Bible translation had to be completed by another Jesuit, György Káldy.
Jesuits were chased away from Hungary and Transylvania again and again: in 1603 their monastery in Kolozsvár was destroyed, but the brothers did not care about people's hate: they returned as soon as they could.
Péter Pázmány
The success of the anti-Reformation was prepared by the new political system of the period after the Bocskai revolt.
At the 1608 parliament Hungarian orders made an agreement with the Habsburgs and realised that that their interests could be supported by the Catholic church.
This process became irreversible through the literary, organising and conversion work of the Archbishop of Esztergom, Péter Pázmány.
First he was a Jesuit, then he became a cardinal, who was a totally new and modern type of intellectual: he could be characterised by adorable preparedness, discernment, the ability to react very quickly and last but not least a talent for writing.
Returning home from Italy and Graz he became the leader of Hungarian intellectual life in a very short period of time - this was even acknowledged by his Protestant opponent.
He used the national language in literature mixed with excellent humour - this was his main weapon. At first it was used by the representatives of the Reformation, but later he turned it against them (for example, against the Lutheran István Magyari and the Calvinist Péter Alvinczi). (Answer, Nagyszombat, 1603; Five Fine Letters, Pozsony, 1609.)
His main work was a polemic theological work built up with the help of crystal clear logic: The Guide (Pozsony, 1613), which summarises and systematised the basic Catholic principles - to defend these from the attacks of the Protestants.
His opponents could hardly recover from the shock, which was caused by this book.
They were forced to translate it into Latin and send it to Wittenberg, so that the theologists there could react to it.
His other great work was the Preachings (Pozsony, 1636), which was published at the end of his life.
His unique style is best represented in this book: he did not intend to use a decorative language but he did.
His prose was fine, rich in periods, and the secret of his magic cannot be found out. We cannot really categorise him as the representative of literary baroque style.
His style had a great impact on the writers of Nyugat, especially Dezsõ Kosztolányi.
Miklós Zrínyi
The significance of Miklós Zrínyi
He was born into an ancient Croatian-Hungarian dignitary family, his great-grandfather was the hero of the battle of Szigetvár in 1566.
Zrínyi was an outstanding figure of Hungarian literary history and also a well-educated, open-minded historical personality even by European terms. He was a politician and a military leader.
János Arany wrote about him that 'he was devoted to the period' and by this he meant that Zrínyi was consciously making himself modern as a politician and an artist.
His devotion, taste and views on life sprang from the age.
He was the rare person, whose walk of life, ideology, high morality, social rank and commitment, education and concrete activities formed a harmonious, inseparable unity.
Zrínyi's most important works all reflect this many-sidedness.
As a politician he realised that there was only one chance for the independence of Hungary: if the country pushed back the Turks alone, without foreign assistance - even against the Habsburgs.
In his emotional, essay-like prose, correspondence and literary works he urged the unity of Hungarian political forces, and he rose above the Catholic-Protestant opposition in this programme of unity.
He dreamt of a modern Hungarian army and a strong national kingdom. His model was Attila and King Matthias, reviving the 16th-century Matthias cult with this.
The emergence of ideological propaganda and literature was not very far from the Baroque idea of art.
As a writer, Zrínyi was a conscious reformer: he adopted several genres in Hungarian literature, he was the first one to print love poems, but the most important thing about him is that he wrote the first Hungarian epic poem.
The Siren of the Adriatic Sea
Zrínyi collected his poetic works into a single volume (Vienna, 1651) - similarly to Balassi and Rimay.
The title of the book needs to be explained: he calls the siren Syrena, and the Adriatic Sea was the southern border of the Zrínyi estate, so we can interpret the title as 'Count Miklós Zrínyi, Hungary's poet'.
In the book the epic poem is preceded by love poems, then come elegies, epigrams and a religious-patriotic ode (To the Crucifix), and finally the Peroratio.
The structure is more than a chronological order.
In the spiritual life of people love comes first, then male maturity - a struggle for the homeland, glory on earth - but both are destroyed by death.
But fame can survive death, in Zrínyi's case it triumphed over time, and indeed, it becomes more important than religious glorification.
However, this kind of immortality belongs to the warrior, not the poet.
Heroism is an important aspect of his lyrics.
In his poems he followed Marino, one of the representatives of Italian baroque, but Zrínyi's tone was more tragic, dramatic and simple.
He tried to introduce the usage of Hungarian versions of the Italian forms, and reformed genres and compositions.
Obsidio Szigetiana - The Sziget Disaster
The aim of the epic poem is many-sided.
First of all, it is quite obvious that in recalling the memory of Turkish-Hungarian conflict he directs the reader's attention to that fact the most important goals of which is to drive out the Turks.
God sent the Turks to Hungary as a punishment for sins, and his revenge will last for three to four generations - that is, it would end in his grand-grandson's life.
God's anger and intervention has another meaning: only the true believers can defeat the pagans and save Christianity.
Zrínyi's moral, religious message is in harmony with the world of ideas of the anti-Reformation, and the composition and form of the epic poem reflect baroque taste.
The basic conception of the epic poem is a paradox: he wanted to introduce the losing heroes of Szigetvár to the readers as the triumphant ones.
This task corresponds to baroque ideas.
The paradox was solved successfully by the author: the attacking Turkish army do not fight against the sinful Hungarian army, but a moral one.
Although soldiers can be destroyed physically, they nevertheless represent moral values which crush and disperse the Turkish army.
(It is also important that the poet attributes the sultan's death to his great-grandfather.)
The glory of the Szigetvár heroes are ensured by the composition as well: the poem starts in Heaven with God's anger and it also finishes there, when the forgiving God raises all the heroes next to Himself.
Sources
It is the poet himself who wrote about the sources in the preface: first of all he followed antique patterns, Homer and Virgil.
The works of contemporary Italian epic poets had a great influence on Zrínyi, the most important one was Tasso's epic poem, Jerusalem Saved.
The topic of Aeneis and that of Zrínyi's epic poem are identical.
According to medieval traditions the figure of Aeneis is a Christ figure (figura Christi), that is Christ's symbol. Tasso based his own epic hero on this religious, pious model.
Zrínyi's figure of his great-grandfather was more human and vivid, compared to the figures of his poet predecessors. On the other hand, for him the hero of Szigetvár was athleta Christi, that is, the champion of faith, who - similarly to Christ - saves Hungarian people and gains redemption for them through his own sacrifice of blood.
In the preface Zrínyi refers to the fact that he recognised and used the works of famous humanist historiographers (the Latin works of János Zsámboky and Miklós Istvánffy), but he also added - as an important artistic principle - that he mixed history with fables.
Zrínyi also had a huge library, the inventory of which has survived in the inheritance inventory, and the majority of the books can still be found in the National and University Libraries of Zagreb.
Unfortunately, the manuscript collection mentioned in the inventory did not survive. It contains Balassi's 'lascivious songs' (love poems).
This piece of information is very important, firstly because it shows how Balassi's poetry spread in the decades after his death, and secondly because Zrínyi's love poems reflect the continuity of Hungarian court poetry.
Baroque court poetry
Zrínyi's work is a complicated, multifold one, so it did not become popular among the common people.
However, several of his contemporaries and followers created very entertaining literature with their popular, easy-to-understand works.
Literary bishops, poet canons and court priests used the effective, baroque topics of the Holy Heart, the four final things (death, judgement, hell and heaven) or judgement day. This latter one was adopted by Kristóf Darholcz in his excellent prose translation, Novissima tuba (Kassa, 1639).
The dignitary representatives of intellectual life lived in dignitary courts, and their activities were many-sided: in the service of court representation they were responsible for the heroisation of the lord's deeds and recording his family life.
The most outstanding representative of this style was István Gyöngyösi, who became very popular in his lifetime.
His verse epics was based on the historical tradition of Tinódi and Zrínyi.
He knew Balassi's love poems, so his work of life is also the continuation of this poetic tradition.
He is one of the most conscious authors from a poetic-rhetorical point of view, as is shown in the prefaces of his works.
His excellent verse forms, technical skills, clear language and the ability of crate images made him the most popular writer in the 18th century.
He had a great impact on the forthcoming generations.
He consciously developed the Hungarian language. Although later Kazinczy accused him of spoiling the taste of the Hungarians, he considered him his predecessor as a language reformer.
Gyöngyösi's patrons were the representatives of different political circles of the age: Palatine Ferenc Wesselényi, who followed the views of Zrínyi, the poet, the court-loyal Pál Eszterházy (who was a many-sided artist himself), Imre Thököly - the chief principal of the insurrectionists (he wrote the famous epitalamium for his wedding), the pro-Austrian István Koháry, who was Thököly's prisoner for a long time and dealt with poetry, and Péter Andrássy, to whom he dedicated his work entitled Chariclia.
Puritanism and Encyclopaedism
The sudden advance of Catholicism gradually pushed back the forces of the Reformation, which became more and more elevated in the 17th century.
Puritans returning from Dutch and English universities had a new view of literature in the middle of the century.
He found a shelter in Zsuzsa Lorántffy ( the widow of György Rákóczi I's) court at Sárospatak.
Pál Medgyesi translated one of the basic works of English Puritanism, Lewis Bayly's Praxis pietatis into Hungarian with a great rhetoric invention (Debrecen, 1636). This work is the manual of individual religion, free of external bonds, which is based on strict self-analysis.
Its practical views reject mannerist 'court pomp'.
The modern ideal of education of the Puritans, the reform of education was written down by the encyclopaedists.
At this time the greatest pedagogist of the period, Comenius (who searched omniscience), taught at Sárospatak.
János Apáczai Csere from Transylvania studied the learning methods of encyclopaedists from the best manuals and he wanted to compile scientific knowledge into a logical system - in Hungarian, (Hungarian Encyclopaedia, Utrecht, 1653).
His sources included the works of Descart, but Apáczai's cartesianism is inconsistent and ambiguous - so he could not avoid slanders.
One of the most talented Protestant figures of the age was Miklós Tótfalusi Kis.
He studied typography in Amsterdam.
Letters set by him, the classical, so-called 'Dutch antique' letters, are still considered masterpieces in Europe today.
With his technical knowledge he wanted to serve the Hungarian readers. For example, he published a sample-sized Bible in Amsterdam (1685).
He corrected the Holy Scripture according to the principles of rational Bible criticism, so he had to suffer from contempt and disdain at home.
His efforts to defend himself in the biographical book, Excuse (Kolozsvár, 1698), were in vein, ecclesiastic and secular authorities managing to break this self-conscious, modern, bourgeois thinker.
Writers of memoirs
The outstanding works of art of baroque prose were memoirs, diaries and autobiographies.
They did not appear in print, but rather were spread in manuscripts.
This was not a Hungarian phenomenon, since the memoir was a popular genre throughout Europe.
This genre had some preliminaries in Hungarian literature: Mihály Vörösmarty (1572-1645) started to write his History of His Conversion in 1610 (1634).
The author was a Calvinist preacher, who became a Catholic under the influence of Péter Pázmány. His book is a confession and a theological work related to religious debates.
Hungarian memoir writers were outstanding personalities, mainly politicians, whose works were usually written during imprisonment.
In their memoirs they tried to clear their historical situation and deeds, so these works are consciously subjective.
In spite of this fact memoirs were important historical sources.
János Kemény (1607-1662), later Transylvanian principal, wrote about the important events of his life during a period of two-year Tartar imprisonment on the Crimean peninsula. He made boring history more interesting by adding anecdotes to it.
János Szalárdi (1616-1666) wrote about the same period in his Miserable Hungarian Chronicle.
Although he talks about himself in the third person singular, subjective details, descriptions make his work a memoir, rather than a historical work.
Miklós Bethlen wrote his works after the recapture of Buda and the country, but those reflect the ideas of the previous period.
He considered St August and Petrarca his models. At the end of his life, during his imprisonment in Vienna he wrote Biography, in which we can read about the experiences of an educated thinker, politician and believer.
Upon Zrínyi's death he participated in hunting, and we know about the details of the accident from his work.
Driving the Turks out of the country did not mean a redemption or a real period of change for either politicians or writers.
Culture remained the same for a long period of time and intellectual life became even more depressed and low-spirited.
TURKISH LITERATURE
The layers of Turkish history of literature
The history of literature was a neglected segment of the history of culture of the occupied regions.
There are three layers in Osman literature - from the point of view of quality: folk, asic and divan literature.
Another categorisation could rely on the relationship of authors with the occupied regions.
According to this one there were works known in the occupied regions but written elsewhere; works written about the occupied regions and works written in the occupied regions.
The first group reflects intellectual works coming to the occupied regions, the second one reflects interest in the occupied regions, while the third one reflects local intellectual activities.
We are going to examine literature according to the these two different systems.
Folk poetry
There are almost no data about folk poetry, we can only suppose that the conquerers brought their folk songs with them.
It is certain, however, that there were hardly any Turkish settlers in the occupied regions and the majority of soldiers were of south-Slav origin.
So the 'Turkish' folk songs of the occupied regions might be Serb or Bosnian folk songs originally.
There could have been a Slav folk poetry mixed with Muslim elements similar to that of Bosnia at the beginning of our century.
We have some data about Turkish folk songs, though: several songs mention the fall of Buda and the other important fortresses.
These were known not only in the Balkans (Ignác Kúnos collected such songs in Ada Kale), but also in Anatolia.
Asic poetry
Turkish minstrels are called asics.
Their art was basically verbal, and their songs were accompanied by musical instruments - copuz or chogur.
Recordings from the beginning of the 16th century included a mature, clear style, which is still in use today with minor changes.
The origin of asic poetry is double: on the one hand it derived from traditional Turkish culture before the spread of the Islam.
Verses are syllabic, their structure is the so-called kosma-form.
On the other hand - in contrast to this - the content and composition is connected to Persian love and mythic poetry.
Several events, and pictures are the mirror translations of the original Persian work of art.
The asics were the ceremonial musicians and hymn writers of a special Turkish religion - the alevi-bektasi religion, popular among the nomadic people of Anatolia, the bektasi dervish sect sprang from this group.
As the yanichars - although just formally - belonged to the bektasi sect, the asics appeared on the battlefields, too.
The asic poetry was well-known and practiced in the occupied regions.
Firstly because minstrels were popular in border fortresses, among soldiers; secondly because the bektasi dervishes who settled here spread it.
The most famous centre was Gül Baba's residence in Buda, but there were monasteries in Eger, Fehérvár and Lippa.
Several Christian travel accounts, charters or Muslim chronicles mention the asics of the occupied regions.
Turkish manuscripts, which preserved their poems, also serve as proof of their existence (for example, the Palatics codex).
A lot of names are mentioned in sources from the occupied territories.
One of them, Kul Piri, wrote about the death of a Turkish warrior, Deli Bajadzid, who died in a battle near Tata.
Another one - Ramazan - compared the beauty of Buda to that of Bagdad.
Karadjaoglan described the loot of Petersbourgh, Asic Hassan Temesvári Gázi cried over the loss of the occupied regions.
Besides the local poets there were several others, who stayed for only a short period, or a few campaigns.
Gevheri, one of the most significant asics of the 17th century, mourned an aga of Eger.
His contemporary, Asic Ömer threatened the 'German king' with another Mohács disaster.
Üdüskari sang about the conquest of Érsekújvár, while Mustafa Kul remembered the bloody waves of the river Danube.
Poets wandering from campaign to campaign and the wandering dervishes exchanged literary information between the different parts of the occupied territory.
It is not surprising that the works of asics who never visited these regions were widely known.
The songs of Abdal Kajgasus of the 14th century must have been brought by bektasi dervishes.
Asic Kerem represented Turkish stories (hikaye) in the conquered regions.
There was also a similar love story in Hungarian literature as well, it was called Karadjagoglan and Sultan Ismigan.
Divan literature
Divan poetry was formed under the influence of Arab-Persian literature, which was based on rhythmic verses (aruz).
But the Turkish language was less suitable for metric poetry, and this was a great difficulty for poets: either the language or the verse became imperfect.
The solution was brought by the change of literary language: it was gradually filled with Arab or Persian words, with the help of which it became suitable for metric lines.
This language - the osmanli - was used only by the cultural elite, simple people did not understand it.
The 'osmanification' of the language reached its peak in the 18-19th centuries.
The Osman language - as a language layer - reached every part of the empire, so it was also known in the occupied regions of Hungary.
It was used in administration and religion, taught in the medresek, and of course, all literary works were written in this language.
The basic element of divan poetry was the beyt, most of the verse forms were built from this: the gazel, the caside and the mesnevi.
There were other minor verse forms, for example, the murabba or the muhammes.
Poems were either collected into a volume by the poet (divan), or they were compiled in anthologies (medjuma).
Divan poetry was well-known in the occupied regions of Hungary.
The works of the great predecessors (Nizami, Sadi, Ahmedi) as well as contemporaries (Fuzuli, Hataji, Zati, Revani, Muhibbi, that is, Suleyman the Great) were all popular.
Local poets were also known.
Mehmed Vüdjüdi sang about the beauty of Buda, Hisali remembered Gül Baba.
Dervish Lamekani was brought up in Pest, Miri in Buda.
Saji was a kadhi in Szigetvár.
Tasli-jali Jajha begh fought in all the campaigns of Suleyman and wrote his works on his estate in Zvornik.
According to Evlia Chelebi the most outstanding poets of Buda were Gazi Chelebi, Nazi Chelebi and Sami Chelebi in the middle of the 17th century.
The other branch of divan poetry included narrative poems and novels in verse (masnevi).
The great classics of the genre were read in the occupied regions: Mevlana's Masnevi or Firdaus's Sahname.
The paraphrases of Fuzuli's Opium and Wine was written by Crimean khan, Gazi Girej II in Pécs (Coffee and Wine), although this work was lost.
The name of mesnevis which described military events was gazavaname.
Many of them were about wars in Hungary: the occupation of Buda, Esztergom, Siklós, Gyõr, Kanizsa.
The most popular topic was the siege of Szigetvár.
Even though some authors participated in military campaigns, their works were not written there.
The mesnevi about the heroes of Görösgál was interesting because it could have been written by the local kadhi and it was preserved in the Pecsev chronicle.
On the basis of its name Gyulevi (Gyula) might have been from the occupied regions, he mentioned the siege of the fortress of Gyula.
From among the prosaic works of divan literature only the historical ones deal with the occupied regions in Hungary.
The majority of them describes the history of the Osman dynasty (Nesri, Sadeddin, Pasha Lufti).
The continuation of these works are Ibrahim Pecseri (of Pécs)'s chronicle using Istvánffy and Heltai as sources and Kjatib Chelebi's work.
There were stories about the glory of rulers, such as the Suleymannames, where we can find references to Hungary (Jelalzade).
Some of them described only a military campaign, like Kemalpasazade's Mohács-name, a copy of which was made by Ibrahim bin Ali in Szolnok in 1575.
(This work is also the only memory of miniature printing of the conquered regions.)
Chronicles about the pashas of Buda, like Mustapha Sokullu and Hassan Tiryaki represent local stories.
The Tarih Üngürüs (The History of Hungary) is a special one, which was written by Mahmud Terjuman of Hungarian origin.
Travel descriptions, scientific, religious and mystic essay also belong to divan prose.
The most significant travel description is Evlia Chelebi's Seyahatname, which is the most important source of the cultural history of the conquered regions.
A less important example is Behram Dimiski's brief essay from the end of the 17th century.
There were scientific and religious works in each medrese.
A school book, which contains the explanation of the Koran, law and poetry, also survived.
The teachers of medreses (hodjas) sometimes wrote their own books.
Ömer Efendi, one of the professors in Buda, compiled a book on law, and Ibrahim's essays on the law of Buda (mufti fetva) were also collected in a book.
Ali Dede, a guard of Suleyman's turbe, wrote mystic essays. Ahmed Dede worked in the mevlev monastery of Pécs.
Ahmed Bidjan's mystic writing from the 15th century was available in Hungarian: Gábor Bethlen's Turkish student, János Házi translated it into Hungarian and it was printed in Kassa in 1626.
The influence of Turkish literature
Cultural relationships between the Turks and the Hungarians were first of all financial; there were hardly any in the field of literature.
Bálint Balassi knew the poetry of the conquerers very well.
Two of his songs were written under the influence of asic poems, following their melody patterns.
The source of the third one, which was translated into Hungarian quite freely, is not known.
He collected Turkish beyts - which belonged to divan poetry - and their reinterpreted translations into a book.
Besides Balassi's works only a few poems were of Turkish origin: a poem in asic form, but in Hungarian, and a bilingual one in murabba form, and a couple of Turkish songs of unknown origin.
We can presume, however, that several motifs of Hungarian love poems are of Turkish origin.
ARTS
HISTORY OF ART
Introduction
Changes in the social-political framework of artistic life
In the sixteenth century, two basic factors determined artistic life in Hungary.
One was the Turkish occupation of the country, which after the battle of Mohács in 1526 divided the country into two parts, then, with the fall of Buda in 1541, into three.
In the 1540s, the most important centres of art were completely destroyed and ceased to function thereafter.
The capital city of Buda was lost, and so was Esztergom, the ecclesiastical centre, Székesfehérvár, the coronation and burial centre of the Hungarian kings, as well as the bishopric centres of Pécs, Veszprém, Vác, Eger, and, for short a time at the end of the century, even Gyõr.
Artistic life that had flourished for centuries now suddenly came to a halt, and the surviving parts could not carry on the integrating role of those which had been destroyed.
The political and ecclesiastical centre was transferred to Pozsony (Bratislava) and Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia), while the Habsburg royal seat itself had always been outside the country, in Vienna and Prague.
The traditional artistic spheres were best preserved in the newly formed duchy in Transylvania, but even there new structures were formed only by the second half of the century, with Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Romania) as the centre.
The other crucial factor in the formation of artistic life was the spread of Protestantism.
Many of the new religious movements that turned against Catholicism were iconoclasts, and much of the medieval art that survived the various wars was eventually destroyed by them.
Such was the fate, for example, of the interior decoration and furnishings of the cathedrals of Várad (Oradea, Romania) and Gyulafehérvár.
(In Lutheran churches, on the other hand, many works of art were preserved.)
Numerous genres of art that had flourished for centuries, such as panel painting, wooden sculpture, and manuscript illumination, disappeared by the end of the first third of the century.
Major stylistic trends in art
The art of Hungary between the battle of Mohács (1526) and the recapture of Buda (1686) falls into the time period of the Renaissance and the Baroque (besides the latest phase of the Gothic), and to these two terms in scholarly literature recently a third, Mannerism has also been added.
However, these terms, generally used to denote the major stylistic trends of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European art, can be applied to local artistic products in Hungary only to a limited extent.
The Renaissance is present in its pure and high quality form only during the Matthias- and Jagello-period, and even then primarily only in imported works of art.
At that time, the Late Renaissance in Italy was already characterised by parallel tendencies of classicism and Mannerism, but high quality works of this period in painting and sculpture were never produced in Hungary, and the dominant military character of architecture - however up-to-date - has prevented it from becoming a major stylistic force.
Changes in art were best demonstrated in the ornamentation of new works of art: the all'antica decoration of the quattrocento and the early cinquecento is replaced by Beschlägwerk-, Rollwerk-, later Knorpelwerk- and acanthus motifs.
The appearance in Hungary of the Baroque style, born around 1600 in Italy, poses even more problems.
The high artistic level that characterised the imported all'antica art in the time of King Matthias (Mátyás) was missing here: not even the works of the most outstanding painters and sculptors reached Hungary.
Baroque motifs appeared here in the second third of the seventeenth century, in art commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church and the aristocracy loyal to the royal court, but did not become widespread until the eighteenth century. Especially in the genres of the grand art a strong conservatism was prevalent.
Only in Transylvania did the Renaissance tradition firmly live on into the seventeenth century.
The frameworks of artistic life: courts and patrons
Humanistic patronage
In the decades following the battle of Mohács, Pozsony (Bratislava) became the most important centre of artistic life in Royal Hungary.
The best educated humanists of the country lived and worked here, and they had close ties with the royal court in Vienna, since many of them were in the service of the Habsburg administration.
The most important gathering place of these educated prelates and their circles was the house and garden - with its famous linden tree that inspired numerous poets - of István Radéczy, Bishop of Eger and royal governor.
The group included Miklós Istvánffy, the historiographer, Nicasius Ellebodius, the Greek philologist, György Purkircher, the physician, Carolus Clusius, the famous botanist, Zakariás Mossóczy, the jurist, Boldizsár Batthyány, and others.
Their portraits were executed by the Dalmatian engraver Martino Rota, who came to Hungary at the invitation of Antal Verancsics.
He engraved the coat of arms and the portrait of Radéczy himself, who had a famous collection of antiquities and medals.
In the cathedral of Pozsony they jointly erected a tomb for their mutual friend Nicasius Ellebodius (d. 1577), which carried an epitaph by Istvánffy and was decorated with the relief of the two-faced Janus, the guardian of the gate of death.
Many other members in this group had collections of antique medals and also collected inscriptions of Roman monuments.
Few original works of arts have survived from their collections; their visual artistic culture has been best documented by written sources.
Miklós Oláh
Miklós Oláh was one of the most prominent personalities of mid-sixteenth-century Hungary.
After the battle of Mohács, he accompanied the widow of Louis II to the Low Countries, then, after many years, he returned to his home country to become Bishop of Zagreb, then Archbishop of Esztergom and Royal Governor.
He was an erudite humanist, and a good friend of Erasmus of Rotterdam. He wrote works in Latin on Attila and on Hungary.
His portrait by Hans Sebold Lautensack from 1558 depicts him as a true humanist, with a book in his hand.
It was he who helped the chapter and the archiepiscopate (together with the treasury) to flee from Esztergom and settle in Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia).
He maintained palaces in Vienna, Pozsony (Bratislava), and Nagyszombat, the splendid interior decorations of which - including in particular a large number of tapestries - was recorded in the will of the archbishop.
He was very fond of gardens; his most famous was the Nicoletum in Vienna.
His artistic patronage forms an important part of the history of art in Hungary.
He had the litterae armales which he received from King Ferdinand I in 1548 decorated with uniquely sumptuous miniature decorations, in which he included his own portrait along with those of his relatives and of rulers of Hungary (thereby expressing his loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty).
The library of Oláh, partly collected during his stay in the Low Countries, also had great fame; it even included an eleventh-century Evangelistarium.
He provided for the decoration of his books as well. His printed pontifical received an ornamental binding, its woodcuts were hand-coloured, and his coat of arms was included in the decoration.
He also planned to have the unfinished miniatures of a famous late-medieval codex, the so-called Bakócz Gradual completed (1557).
The tombstone of Oláh, an exceptionally fine work of red marble with inscribed bronze plaques, stands in the church of St. Nicholas in Nagyszombat.
Pál Bornemisza
Pál Bornemisza, the Bishop of Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia), had a significant political role in sixteenth-century Hungary. He received more and more advanced positions within the Habsburg administration; and became Royal Governor at the peak of his career.
He was the first art collector in Hungary about whom not only dry data documenting his activities have survived, but his passion for collecting has also been well documented.
In collecting, he was driven by his pious attitude: he attempted to save everything he could from the lost ecclesiastical treasures.
The liturgical objects that he purchased or redeemed he had repaired, reconstructed and kept for his own use until in his last will he had them returned to those four churches where he had served as a prelate during his long life.
Many objects of the collegiate church of Óbuda, and of the bishoprics of Veszprém, Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), and Nyitra are known to posterity only from his will.
Some pieces of his collection have survived to this day; for example, his mitre in the cathedral of Gyõr and two chalices in Nyitra.
The Angevin-period mitre used to be in the possession of the church of Veszprém, but Bornemisza had its pearl decoration renewed in Late Renaissance style (1550).
One of the chalices had been decorated by antique gold coins at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and it was perhaps this unique trait that made the bishop keep the piece for himself. This work is one of the earliest examples of the so-called "dishes with pagan coins" that later became so common in Hungary.
Demeter Náprágyi
Demeter Náprágyi (d. 1619) had mainly an ecclesiastical career, with little role in the political life of the country.
He was a respected, educated man, who had been schooled in Vienna.
He became Bishop of Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Romania) in 1597, from where he fled in 1600, taking with him part of the ducal library of Transylvania, which was thus saved from destruction.
Náprágyi also acquired the head reliquary of St. Ladislas, originally preserved in the cathedral of Várad (Oradea), whose crown had been lost in the meantime. To replace it, he had a new crown made in Prague, richly decorated with gems, which is seen on the reliquary to this day.
In his last will, the bishop left a number of Flemish tapestries to the cathedral of Gyõr.
One of them was probably the one, depicting the Nativity, which is preserved in the Museum of Applied Arts today.
This enormous tapestry was probably made in Brussels around 1520, and came into Náprágyi's hands from one of his predecessors.
The Nativity tapestry is the sole surviving example of the numerous tapestries mentioned in sixteenth-century inventories.
Náprágyi's red marble tombstone decorated with his coat of arms is found in the cathedral of Gyõr.
The ducal court of Transylvania in the time of the Báthorys
The ducal court in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia) was formed during the reign of Queen Isabella, who was forced to leave Buda for Transylvania (d. 1599), along with her son János Zsigmond (d. 1571). This Transylvanian town continued to be the centre of courtly life during the reign of the Báthorys, until the end of the century.
Very little is known about the art patronage of János Zsigmond.
Duke István Báthory, who acceded to the throne in 1571, and continued the construction of the castles started by his predecessor in Szamosújvár (Gherla) and Várad (Oradea). His ecclesiastical building activities in Gyulafehérvár and Kolozsvár (Cluj) were related to the settlement of the Jesuit order in Transylvania.
Although he also became King of Poland in 1576, he maintained close ties with Transylvania. During this time, artistic ties between Poland and Hungary were especially close: Transylvanian masters worked in Cracow, while it was through the court of Cracow that Italian architects or Italian works of art - such as the miniature wax portrait of King István Báthory - found their way into Transylvania.
Báthory had a library's worth of books purchased for his nephews Zsigmond and András (the later dukes), and had the volumes bound in splendid bindings.
An especially imposing work was the tomb (1584-85) he ordered for his brother Kristóf Báthory (d. 1584) from Willem van den Blocke, a master of Dutch origin active in Gdansk.
This representative work, erected in the Jesuit church of Gyulafehérvár, became the example to follow for many seventeenth-century ducal monuments.
After the death of the Polish king in 1586, the Transylvanian court remained an important artistic centre, and became even more resplendent during the reign of Zsigmond Báthory, who oriented himself towards the Habsburg court. This period, however, is known to us mainly from written documents, since nearly everything was destroyed during the disorder that followed the deposition of the duke.
Ferenc Nádasdy
Ferenc Nádasdy was one of the most significant patrons of art in seventeenth-century Hungary.
As perhaps the wealthiest aristocrat of the country, he held powerful positions and became Judge Royal at the zenith of his career.
His patronage was influenced not only by his wealth and position but also by the fact that he often visited Italy and Germany, and even attended the universities of Padua and Siena.
He was a patron of literature, publishing books and setting up a printing press on his estate. In 1664 he issued the Mausoleum, a collection of portraits of rulers that defined the tradition of ruler portraiture for centuries.
He also erected impressive buildings, the most outstanding ecclesiastical ones including the Servite friary and church in Lorettom and the Augustinian friary and church in Léka (Lockenhaus, Austria, the burial place of the Nádasdy family).
His two family residences in Sárvár and Sopronkeresztúr were also built in a grand manner; the decoration of the main hall in Sárvár with battle scenes from the Turkish wars is especially outstanding.
Written documents testify to his wide-ranging contacts with numerous artists, among them the painters Jan Thomas and Benjamin Block, and the architect Carlo Carlone, who were all among the most eminent artists active in seventeenth-century Hungary.
Nádasdy also possessed a remarkable art collection of paintings, medals, metalwork, and an extensive library.
He had not only engravings but even printing plates and a printing press for engravings in his possession.
He employed a private goldsmith in Augsburg, and goldsmiths' works were also the most valuable pieces in his collection (this was of course partly due to the inherent value of precious metals).
After his disgrace and death in 1671, his wealth was confiscated, thus we know virtually nothing about his collection.
A cart studded with pearls and gems and crowned by the ivory figure of Bacchus sitting on a barrel - a masterpiece of the Drentwett family of Augsburg and now in the Museum of Applied Arts - comes almost certainly from among his treasures.
Pál Esterházy
The art patronage of Pál Esterházy (1635-1713) was characterised not only by his generosity worthy of a prince but also by his ambitions. From the very beginning he was aware of the fact that his patronage of the arts bespoke his high social position.
His unfailing loyalty to the Habsburg house secured him ever higher positions: he was the palatine of the country for a long time, then he received the Order of the Golden Fleece and later the ducal title as well.
The first representative object he commissioned was a large ornamental, gilded silver plate with a pitcher shaped like an equestrian statuette, commemorating the heroic death of his brother László Esterházy, who fell in the battle of Vezekény fighting against the Turks.
This enormous goldsmith's work was the product of the workshop of Philipp Jakob Drentwett in Augsburg.
In addition to this Esterházy later commissioned works of applied arts to celebrate memorable events: on receiving the ducal title he ordered a 1.5 meter long elephant's tusk decorated with carved reliefs of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses.
He rebuilt his family residence in Kismarton (Eisenstadt, Austria), creating the first Baroque château in Hungary.
As a deeply religious person, he supported the construction of many ecclesiastical monuments.
In the church of Mariazell he had a new altar made for the venerated statue; in 1695 he began a new church for the Franciscans in Boldogasszony (Frauenkirche, Austria); and in 1699 he had the vaulting of the nave of the Jesuit church of Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia), founded by his father, decorated with frescos and stucco decoration.
Both the church of Boldogasszony and the frescos in Nagyszombat are early examples of the majestic Baroque style that fully impregnated the art of Hungary in the eighteenth century.
Pál Esterházy also used art to directly promote the importance of his family: he included his own and his father's portrait among the busts of Hungarian leaders portrayed on the main facade of his château in Kismarton, while in 1700 he issued all the portraits of the Esterházys in the lengthy Tropheum.
The duke himself was involved in artistic activities: he composed music and wrote literary works.
The Art of the Book
Book illumination
As the Middle Ages came to a close, the production of new, representative volumes of illuminated books also ceased.
As book printing became widespread, hand written books became less and less frequent, and the making of representative codices slowly went out of fashion.
The old manuscripts came to be appreciated in a different way: they were incorporated in humanists' libraries, or, if they had miniature decoration or valuable bindings, into art collections.
Newly created illuminated books were rather rare in the time period following the battle of Mohács.
In their style of decoration two tendencies can be discerned.
One is characterised by the repetition of the motifs of fifteenth-century Italian Renaissance art, on a rather provincial level, as can be seen on the miniatures of the Kriza-codex, which contains Hungarian prayers (1532).
Here Renaissance vases, cornucopias, and laurel wreaths are placed in the axes of the marginalia symmetrically composed of flowers and tendrils.
The other stylistic tendency employs Late Renaissance ornamentation. Examples for this are the additions to the Bakócz Gradual in 1557, where a rolled cartoon was placed in the centre of the composition, enclosing the coat of arms of Miklós Oláh.
A similarly advanced, oriental arabesque motif decorates the title page of the breviary of János Liszthy, Bishop of Gyõr, painted in the 1570s.
An unusual example of the survival of book illumination can be found in the missal of Ferenc Perényi, Bishop of Várad, who fell in the battle of Mohács: the subsequent owners of this codex had it decorated with new miniatures.
By the seventeenth century, however, the art of book illumination had disappeared forever.
Book printing and binding
Though already invented by the fifteenth century, book printing in Hungary on a large scale did not begin until the second third of the sixteenth.
The new books, which were published in large numbers and reached a much wider audience, were decorated by woodcuts instead of expensive miniatures.
The printing blocks of these woodcuts belonged just as much to the equipment of the printing press as did the printing letters themselves, and they were used without any alteration over and over in many editions, some of them for decades.
Initials and end decoration were inserted even into the simpler volumes, but costly books usually included figural decoration as well.
The title pages were especially lavishly decorated; in fact, this was usually the only page to be decorated at all.
The artistic level of these woodcuts was rather modest in most Hungarian books; their motifs nevertheless popularised the ornamental elements of the Late Renaissance and Mannerism.
The taste of the audience may also have been influenced by the decoration of the growing number of imported books.
With the decline in the use of richly illuminated late medieval representative codices, also the splendid book bindings became less frequent.
The backs of the costliest books were covered with coloured velvet and supplied with silver clasps.
Most of the books, however, had only a simple binding for everyday use, often of leather with impressed, and sometimes with gilded decoration.
Their style followed German Renaissance bindings made with rollers and stamping plates, such as the products of the workshop working with the printing press of Heltai in Kolozsvár (Cluj, Romania).
These show biblical heroes and antique profile portraits among tendrils, while the centre is filled by a larger figural decoration, sometimes a portrait of the great leaders of the Reformation, Luther and Melanchton.
The fate of the Corvina library
The Corvina library, one of the most notable achievements of King Matthias, had already suffered much damage and diminished in size by the time of the battle of Mohács.
The surviving pieces were seized by the army of Suleiman, and most were taken to Constantinople.
However, in the sixteenth century some volumes had already been brought back to Hungary: Antal Verancsics, for example, acquired two Corvina volumes, a Horace and a Thomas Aquinas (today kept in London and Vienna, respectively), during his stay there as an envoy.
Volumes from the Corvina library were by that time very much appreciated in any library: an inscription over the entrance of the court library of Vienna proudly - and justifiably - declared that the collection was based on Corvina volumes, and the municipal library of Brassó (Brasov, Romania) enjoyed similar fame in the sixteenth century.
Until the seventeenth century, in any case, it was generally thought that the majority of the Corvina volumes had remained in Buda, guarded by the Turks.
According to János Szalárdi, Gábor Bethlen (according to other sources, György Rákóczi I) made attempts to acquire from the pashas of Buda and the Sublime Porte the library of King Matthias for the Protestant school of Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia).
Only after the visit of Mihály Apafi I to Buda did the Dukes of Transylvania give up hope of ever receiving the books.
Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century several Corvinas found their way back to Buda from Constantinople, but even recently a new volume, the so-called Antiphonal of Istanbul, was found in the library of the Serai.
Painting
Monumental painting in the two courts
Time has decimated the surviving paintings from the Late Renaissance and Baroque art of the royal and Transylvanian ducal courts.
The series of paintings that were commissioned from the Venetian Giulio Licinio by King Ferdinand I for the chapel of the castle of Pozsony (Bratislava, Slovakia) were destroyed. (Licinio previously worked with Paolo Veronese on the decoration of the Doge palace.)
The paintings in the chapel of Pozsony were in all likelihood inserted into richly gilded stucco frames, according to the custom of the period. The original richness of the whole decoration is implied by a surviving section in what was probably a balcony of the castle.
The stucco worker who collaborated with Licinio worked in the most modern ornamental style: the frames with classical mouldings are filled with finely painted tendrils and slender figures, while in the centre of the lavishly decorated ceiling puttos hold up the coat of arms of King Ferdinand I.
The monumental cycles of murals commissioned by the dukes of Transylvania are known to us from written sources only.
János Zsigmond had the ducal palace of Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia) decorated with scenes of battles and sieges as well as with emblems. The great hall of the castle of Fogaras (Fagarao) received a similar decoration of emblems probably when the castle was in the possession of the Báthory family.
The fresco decorations of the residences of later, seventeenth-century Transylvanian dukes (Gábor Bethlen, György Rákóczi I) are also known from descriptions only.
The paintings that were created for the castle of Pozsony on the order of King Ferdinand III were also destroyed, but have survived in the form of reproduced prints.
This series, painted between 1638-43 by Paul Juvenel, included secular allegories and emblems glorifying Ferdinand II.
The king was represented as a supernatural hero between his contemporaries and antique mythological figures.
The main purpose of the commissioner with this representation was the propagation of the beneficial nature of the Habsburg rule, a probable reason why this grandiose cycle had little direct influence on Hungarian art.
The humanistic portrait
A new genre of art evolving in Hungary in the second half of the sixteenth century was that of the independent portrait.
Despite the existence of this form of art, hardly any painted portraits have survived from the sixteenth century. One example is that of Chancellor János Liszthi, who had his likeness painted in Prague by a Flemish painter.
Liszthi had close ties with Hugo Blotius, the keeper of the imperial library, who - following the example of the Como collection of the famous humanist and history writer Paolo Giovio - compiled a series of portraits of famous men, the so-called Musaeum Blotianum, which also included the portraits of Hungarian nobles.
The visual appearance of the portraits was influenced by the change in the attitude of the commissioners.
This is well illustrated in the portrait engravings executed by Martino Rota, an artist invited to Hungary from Italy by Antal Verancsics.
Rota depicted János Balassa, the royal doorkeeper, in arms, in the tradition of chivalrous iconography, but his other, roughly contemporary engravings of Hungarian nobles reflect a very different, much more "court-oriented" mentality.
He portrayed Miklós Istvánffy, the historiographer, in front of a curtain, in brocade clothes that in spite of their simplicity demonstrate his high standing. The portrait of István Fejérkövy, Bishop of Nyitra (Nitra, Slovakia), was composed in a similar way, although his tomb stone in Nyitra followed the most conventional type.
The most beautiful portrait Rota ever made was of Zakariás Mossóczy, the famous jurist.
He portrayed him as a real humanist, according to the tradition of the noblest portraiture of great men of letters, sitting before his bookstand by his table which is littered with writing tools.
We know from descriptions that in the library room of Mossóczy, in the archiepiscopal palace of Nyitra, several portraits were hung on the walls between the bookstands.
Ancestors' galleries
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Hungarian aristocrats who built magnificent residences also gathered imposing collections of portraits of themselves and their ancestors, in order to immortalise their illustrious families.
These life-size portraits formed an important part of the artistic representation in their castles.
Among the surviving series, those of the Esterházy family are the most imposing - most of their pieces are still preserved in the château at Fraknó (Forchtenau, Austria), - but such ancestors' galleries have been left after the Nádasdy, Batthyány, Forgách, Csáky and other families as well, even if sometimes only fragmentarily.
The painters of these series were often local artists of modest talents who followed the traditional compositions of sixteenth-century courtly portraiture: their figures have rigid postures and stand in a symbolical space, as is exemplified by the portraits of Tamás Nádasdy and his wife Orsolya Kanizsai.
At the same time, portraits of high quality were also created, such as the portrait painted in Vienna of Éva Forgách, the wife of István Csáky (1638) or the portraits of Pál Esterházy and his wife Orsolya Esterházy by Benjamin Block, who worked for Hungarian clients in the middle of the century.
Block also portrayed Ferenc Nádasdy and his wife, who insisted on the traditional portrayal of their figures, even though the rooms in which they stand were carefully painted, with a view opening through the windows.
The traditional view lived on for a long time, but by the second half of the century some details began to loosen the strict tradition.
In the portraits of Péter Zrínyi (1650-60) and Kristóf Batthyány (?) (mid-seventeenth century) the background was given more emphasis: the dynamic battle scenes in the back illustrate the bravery of the depicted persons.
The half-length portrait of the poet Miklós Zrínyi by Jan Thomas, a disciple of Rubens, shows a close observation of subtle psychological feeling.
Historical battle scenes
A new, very influential genre of Baroque painting was that of the monumental historical battle scene. Because of the constant Turkish wars, this type of subject matter was especially topical in Hungary, the only region in which this genre is traceable.
The first surviving series of battle scenes decorates the ceiling of the great hall of the castle of Sárvár.
Its commissioner was Ferenc Nádasdy, Judge Royal (iudex curiae regis) and one of the wealthiest aristocrats of the country; the painter has been identified as Hans Rudolf Miller of Vienna.
The painted scenes are unified by an extravagantly rich stucco frame. The central scene depicts the battle of Sziszek (Sisak, Croatia); the surrounding smaller compositions, the sieges of the castles of Pápa, Gyõr, Tata, Buda, and Kanizsa.
The representation of Turkish wars was found in many other aristocrats' residences in Western Hungary: in the castle of Miklós Zrínyi in Csáktornya (Cakovec, Slovenia), in the château of Ádám Batthyány in Rohonc (Rechnitz, Austria), and in the Pozsony (Bratislava, Slovakia) palace of György Lippay, Archbishop of Esztergom.
This subject matter even appeared in the ecclesiastical art of the period.
In the Patrona Hungariae altar of the Jesuit church of Gyõr (1642), Hungarian saints raise shields depicting the Blessed Virgin to fend off the arrows of the Turks.
In the high altarpiece of the church of Árpás (1666-67), Hungary is protected by the robe of the Madonna of the Misericordia, and with the Pope and the Emperor who kneel on the ground the leading aristocrats of the time are also portrayed: Ferenc Wesselényi, the count palatine, Ferenc Nádasdy, the Judge Royal, Péter Zrínyi, ban (viceroy, banus) of Croatia, György Szelepcsényi, Archbishop of Esztergom, and György Szécsényi, the Bishop of Gyõr and the probable commissioner of the painting.
These representations express in the language of art the most essential need of the period, the necessity to fight the Turkish enemy.
Reproductive graphics: portraiture
Engravings became one of the most influential media in the Hungarian art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Their proliferation was also influenced by the Counter Reformation movement (since these pictures could be distributed easily and in large numbers), but the most significant engravings were secular works, especially portraits.
Among them, the first important work was the portrait series of 1652 by Elias Widemann.
Widemann published in Vienna a full volume of bust portraits of altogether a hundred Hungarian nobles. These depictions served for a long time as models for the portrait series that decorated Hungarian châteaux and country residences.
Even more influential was the edition of a work called Mausoleum in 1664 in Nuremberg, which contained the full-figure portrayals of the Hungarian rulers from the tribal leaders all the way down to King Ferdinand IV.
These portraits set the canon of ruler portraiture in Hungary until the nineteenth century; and many versions of them in oil painting and fresco were found in the various châteaux.
By copying the ruler portraits of the Mausoleum, the Hungarian nobility connected the history of their own families with that of the country.
This tendency is most conspicuous in the ancestors' gallery of the Batthyánys: the portraits of Ádám and Kristóf Battyhány are closely modelled on those of the Hungarian rulers, as if forming a part of them.
At the end of the century, the Esterházys issued their own, independent series of prints depicting their family members. This work, the Tropheum, was published in 1700 by the palatine Pál Esterházy. Many of its prints, as well as its overall structure, very closely follow the Mausoleum.
Altarpieces
By the second third of the sixteenth century, the most important genres of late medieval ecclesiastical painting had disappeared from art.
Winged altarpieces and grand fresco cycles in churches often fell prey to Protestant iconoclasm.
Among the various branches of Protestantism, Lutheran churches were the only ones to preserve medieval masterpieces of art, and it was also in their circles that the art of altarpieces was reborn at the end of the sixteenth century.
A rare, high quality example of this rebirth is the former high altarpiece of the chapel of the castle of Árva (Orava, Slovakia), today in the church of Necpál (Necpaly, Slovakia), which has a painting with a crowded composition in the centre that expounds the doctrine of salvation in a complicated, Mannerist visual language.
Its commissioner was the palatine György Thurzó, the most important patron of the Lutherans in Hungary.
The altarpiece of the Holy Cross in the collegiate church of Szepeshely (Spiská Kapitula, Slovakia), also from the early seventeenth century, is a good example of how the structure of the medieval altarpiece lived on: the wings are still there, as well as the predella and the crowning decoration, but the wings are immovable, and the whole ornamentation is in the style of Mannerism.
During the rest of the seventeenth century, monumental altarpieces were built, with complex structures and crowded with statues. Some typical examples are the altarpiece of the Thököly castle chapel in Késmárk (Kezmarok, Slovakia) (1657), the high altarpiece of the Roman Catholic church in Rohonc (Rechnitz, Austria) (1679), and the altarpiece of the Franciscan church in Németújvár (Güssing, Austria) (1647-48).
The situation was different in Transylvania where besides "modern" seventeenth-century altarpieces such as that of Segesvár (Sighisoara, Romania) the late medieval altarpiece-type was to be found until the end of the seventeenth century.
The altarpiece of the Lutheran church of Szentágota (Agnita, Romania) from 1650 even has moveable wings, while the structure and ornamentation of the winged altarpiece of Csíkdelne (Delnita, Romania), from 1675, is so conservative that it appears contemporary with sixteenth-century Renaissance altarpieces, such as the one from Csíkménaság (Armaoeni, Romania), dated 1543.
Epitaphs and funerary paintings
One of the most significant genres of funerary art in seventeenth-century Hungary is that of the epitaph hung on the walls of churches.
Epitaphs were made of painted and gilded wood, and had multilevel architectonic structures. In the centre, framed by columns and entablatures, there was a painting, relief, or statues depicting a biblical scene, surrounded by rich ornamentation.
At the bottom, an inscribed plaque was placed to commemorate the virtues of the deceased, who himself was often depicted kneeling in the company of his family.
The structure of epitaphs followed that of altarpieces, on a smaller scale, and the same artists were often occupied with the execution of both.
Epitaphs were especially popular in Protestant circles.
Although originally they were widespread in the whole country, few series have survived until the present day, and these are to be found mainly in the church of St. James in Lõcse (Levoea, Slovakia), in Bártfa (Bardejov, Slovakia) and the Lutheran church of Csetnek (títnik, Slovakia).
In Csetnek, the frames of the epitaph of Tóbiás Geletník (1630s) and of the Razík-epitaph (after 1677) clearly show the forty years' of difference between them: the former has a linear structure and its ornamentation is close to Mannerism, while the latter is more dynamic with its emphasised central part, depicting the Crucifixion, and its ornamental motifs are also much more modern.
Another type of funerary art was that of funerary coats of arms, which were also hung on the walls of churches but had purely heraldic ornamentation. Their frames were inscribed  all around, and decorated with woodcarvings of weapons and banners (for example, the funerary coats of arms of the members of the Esterházy family in Nagyszombat/Trnava, Slovakia).
Another seventeenth-century genre, related both to the cult of the dead and to portrait painting, was the portrait of the deceased lying in state.
Such works may have once hung in castle chapels (for example, the portraits of György Thurzó and Erzsébet Czobor in the castle of Árva/Orava, Slovakia), but could also form part of a castrum doloris (such as the castrum doloris of László Esterházy, 1652).
The depiction of the dead was associated with the stoic ideal of contented death in Late Renaissance literature.
In the portraits, the background was often presented in a decorative and abstract way, but the figures themselves - especially the portraits - were pictured realistically.
The nicest examples were painted of the members of the Illésházy family: of Gáspár Illésházy, Gábor Illésházy and his wife Ilona Thurzó (all in the collection of the Hungarian National Museum).
Sculpture
Funerary monuments in Royal Hungary
The funerary monument became one of the most important sculptural genres after the middle of the sixteenth century.
In the territory of Royal Hungary, there were especially many types of funerary monuments.
The traditional, simplest type of tombstone, with coats of arms and inscriptions, was still used, though with modern decoration (such as the tombstones in the Orbán tower in Kassa/Koice, Slovakia), and so was the tomb with a giant figure (for example, the tombs of Gáspár Serédy in Pozsonyszentgyörgy/Jur pri Bratislave, Slovakia and of György Serédy in Bártfa/Bardejov, Slovakia).
New types of funerary monuments also appeared.
In Pozsony (Bratislava, Slovakia) and its environs (as well as in the somewhat more distant Selmecbánya/Banská tiavnica, Slovakia), a whole series of carved stone Renaissance epitaphs attached to the wall have survived from the last third of the sixteenth century.
In the centre of these pieces is a relief, flanked by the ornamental frames, usually depicting the Crucifixion, with the deceased and his family kneeling at the foot of the cross. In the background, the Heavenly Jerusalem and inscribed plaques can be seen.
Some examples are the epitaphs of Jacobus Mordax in Pozsonyszentgyörgy, of Anna Erdõdy and Wolfgang Kögl in the cathedral of Pozsony, all of which were probably imported from Vienna.
Another new type of funerary monument, the most representative of all, was the wall monument.
In these works, the centre of the several meter high, richly elaborated architectonic stone frame is occupied by the full-figure statue of the deceased.
Such monuments were made both for prelates and important secular people. Among the earliest must have been the one made for Miklós Oláh, Archbishop of Esztergom, in Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia), and for János Rueber, Captain of Upper Hungary, in Kassa.
Occasionally, the various types were mixed: the grand wall monument of János Chereody frames an enormous epitaph in which the Archbishop is portrayed kneeling in front of the Crucified (Nagyszombat, St. Nicholas).
The figural tombstones of Royal Hungary are of three distinct types according to the political orientation and social standing of the deceased.
The traditional, medieval composition was best preserved in prelates' tombstones.
The tombstones of Ferenc Újlaki, Bishop of Gyõr, in Pozsony (1555), of János Kuthassy, Archbishop of Esztergom, in Nagyszombat (1601), and of Márton Hetési Pethe in Szepeshely (Spiská Kapitula, Slovakia) all portray the prelates frontally, with hierarchic rigidity, in their full attire.
The aristocratic tombstones were much more diverse.
Also some of these preserved, or even consciously renewed, the traditional forms: the seventeenth-century tombstones of the Thurzós in Lõcse (Levoea, Slovakia) imitate the hundred years earlier tombstones of the Szapolyais in Szepeshely.
On some tombstones, the figures were represented in Hungarian festive costumes (for example, the funerary monument of Ferenc Révai in Túrócszentmárton/Martin, Slovakia, 1553), while more frequently they were shown in the attire of the Renaissance military leader, holding a staff in their hands.
The first example of this latter type is the Rueber-monument in the cathedral of Kassa (Koice, Slovakia): the marble figure of the deceased once stood as an independent statue in the central niche.
Among several others, the tomb of György Drugeth, Judge Royal, also exemplifies this "court-oriented" figure- and tomb monument-type (in Nagyszombat, 1620). The richest example of this type was, however, planned for the hero of Gyõr, Miklós Pálffy, to be erected in the sanctuary of the cathedral of Pozsony.
A model was made for the monument in the workshop of Paul Mayr of Augsburg, of which at least the central figure came to be executed (today in the Franciscan church of Pozsony). Although the design was spectacular, the overall execution in Mannerist style must have seemed so strange to contemporary Hungarian taste that in the end a far more modest monument was erected for Pálffy in the cathedral.
Funerary monuments in Transylvania
In Transylvania, similar types of Late Renaissance tombstones were erected as in Royal Hungary.
Here the traditional tombstone with coats of arms and inscriptions was the most popular (for example, the Mikola tombstones in Szamosfalva/Someoeni and the tombstone of Balázs Tötöri in Tötör/Tioltiur), but there were also tombs, stone epitaphs, and wall monuments.
Representative funerary monuments were erected in the cathedral of Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), the burial place of the dukes.
Most of these have been destroyed, except for the tombs of the Zápolyas: the tombs of Queen Isabella and of János Zsigmond.
These are enormous sarcophagi carved out of white marble, with life-size giant figures of the deceased on the top.
They were not produced by local masters, nor were the later ducal funerary monuments: Kristóf Báthory's was brought to Transylvania from Gdansk, those of Gábor Bethlen and his first wife, and of György Rákóczi and Zsigmond Rákóczi, from Cracow.
The crowded Mannerist decoration of the Zápolya tombs appears on other Transylvanian funerary monuments as well, for example, on the tomb of Zsófia Patócsi (once in Küküllõvár/Cetatea de Balta).
The Saxon funerary monuments, whose monumental series survive in Berethalom (Biertan) and Nagyszeben (Sibiu), have a separate history in the development of Transylvanian funerary art.
These figural tombstones of bishops, judges, and burghers are directly rooted in the sculptural traditions of the German Late Renaissance.
The most beautiful, intact seventeenth-century Transylvanian tomb was carved for György Apafi of Almakerék (Malîncrav) in 1635 by Elias Nicolai, an outstanding Saxon sculptor active in Nagyszeben.
The figure of the deceased, dressed in armour, lies on the cover of the tomb among grapevines. The sides are decorated by symbolic figures and inscribed plaques.
Among the grapevines, Death himself appears as a skeleton with an hourglass in his hand.
It is the allegorical representations and the frequent biblical citations that make this work a typical Protestant product.
The artist signed this excellent work on its front side, at a very prominent location.
Architecture
Burgher houses in Kolozsvár (Cluj, Romania)
For the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century constructions that were being carried out all over the country, the more elaborate carved stones were not prepared on site but in the stone carving workshops of the larger towns. From the workshop the stones were transported over large distances, sometimes even from one end of the country to another, or abroad.
The towns where the stone carvings were made, of course, used them themselves.
Such stone carving activity existed in Pécs and its environs before 1526, but after the battle of Mohács it was in Transylvania, namely in Kolozsvár (Cluj), that the activity and the stylistic development of such urban workshops can be traced on sixteenth-century burgher houses.
These houses usually had an L-shaped ground-plan. Behind their gates in the facade, an elongated wing reached far into the back, parallel with the narrow courtyard.
Unfortunately, many of them were demolished or altered in the nineteenth century, but their Renaissance door- and window-frames were at least preserved in museums.
The most notable Renaissance building of the town was the so-called Wolphard-Kakas house.
Adorján Wolphard, the parish priest and learned humanist (the publisher of the works of Janus Pannonius) had this house on the main square altered in Renaissance style between 1534-44.
The main facade of the two-storey house had two windows and the entrance gate on the ground floor, and three windows on the upper one. The well-proportioned frames were decorated by Wolphard's coat of arms and Latin sententiae.
The doors were framed by Corinthian pilasters and richly moulded entablatures.
An especially beautiful part of the house was the so-called Zodiac room, named after its corbels decorated with the signs of the Zodiac, which was already planned by István Wolphard, a former student at the Wittemberg university, but finished only under the subsequent owner, István Kakas.
The building came into the possession of István Kakas, the prothonotarius of the duke, in the last third of the century. The door and window frames on the courtyard wing, decorated with his coat of arms, have Doric friezes and rusticated pilasters, representing the more severe, tectonic formal language of the Late Renaissance.
The architecture of Royal Hungary: the Transdanubian region
The most significant, still standing Late Renaissance castle of the Transdanubian region is that of Sárvár, which in this period was for long time the seat of the Nádasdy family.
This pentagonal fortress with Italian bastions was constructed in the middle of the sixteenth century. At the same time was built, within the fortified walls, the castle building itself, whose pentagonal complex received its final form between 1588-1615.
The pentagonal ground-plan is unique in the Transdanubian region; more typical were the rectangular châteaux built around a central, arcaded courtyard, and fortified with towers on their four corners.
The earliest example of this latter type is the château of Egervár, which was built around an inner court and fortified with corner towers in the second half of the sixteenth century, when it was owned by Kristóf Nádasdy.
The layout of the now ruined castle of Kanizsa was similar. It was planned some time before 1572 by Pietro Ferrabosco, an architect in the service of the royal court.
The most beautiful, still standing example is the enormous château of Sopronkeresztúr, which was begun in the 1560s but received its final form, with the splendid, arcaded courtyard, only during its construction by Tamás Nádasdy, the Judge Royal.
The spacious chapel in one of the corner towers, with retardataire Gothic tracery in its windows, was also built at this time.
(It was not at all rare, to use the Gothic style in Hungary in the ecclesiastical art of the period.)
The symmetric layout of these châteaux followed Late Renaissance Italian examples; their exterior decoration was, however, excessively puritan: the walls were plain and undivided, decorated only by the entrance gate, framed by rusticated pilasters (for example, in Sárvár and Léka/Lockenhaus, Austria).
The architects, when known at all, were masters from Northern Italy who worked in the Habsburg territories, north of the Alps.
The architecture of Royal Hungary: Upper Hungary
Renaissance architecture in Upper Hungary was much more diverse, depending on the proximity of the various parts to the Austrian, Moravian, Polish or Transylvanian regions.
The facades of buildings were also characterised here by large, undivided plains, with a crenellation on the top and quoins on the corners. The courtyards were surrounded by arcades resting on columns or pillars.
This arrangement remained the same throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, even though the decoration and the architectural details changed.
Castle architecture was also the most dominant in this region; both new fortresses were built (in Komárom/Komarno and Érsekújvár/Nové Zámky) and old castles modernised (Árva/Orava, Trencsény/Trencín).
From the end of the sixteenth century, residential castles were also often laid out symmetrically.
The late-sixteenth-century château of the Thurzós in Nagybiccse (Bytea) also had a rectangular ground-plan, sturdy round towers on the corners, and an arcade surrounding its inner courtyard.
The arcade was a very common motif, often found on aristocratic residences and burghers' town houses, and even occurring as an exterior feature on seventeenth-century facades (for example, in Alsómicsinye/Dolná Mitiná).
The "crenellated Renaissance"
For a long time, a special stylistic feature of Late Renaissance Hungarian architecture was known as the "crenellated Renaissance in Upper Hungary."
This category needs to be revised today: the "crenellated Renaissance" did not originate in Hungarian architecture, and it was universal in the Eastern European region.
In the upper part of Royal Hungary, however, it was indeed very frequently used for the ornamentation of buildings.
The various forms of crenellations were usually placed over the main entablature of buildings, occasionally with an intervening attic storey.
The crenellation as an emphasised decorative architectonic motif was widespread in sixteenth and seventeenth-century architecture in Central Europe, and is of Northern Italian origin.
It was equally used on churches, public and private urban buildings, and residential castles.
It seems that in the Szepes and Sáros regions a local variant developed that originated directly from the work of the numerous Italian masters working in Hungary. The contemporary Hungarian name for this decoration (olaszfok, "Italian grades") also refers to this direct relationship.
The forms of the decorative crenellation were very diverse; sometimes it was reduced to a blind arcade or appeared only in the pattern of the plastering, as in Hédervár.
It often occurred together with the sgraffito technique, where the sgraffito patterns were usually purely ornamental (as in Késmárk/Kesmarok), but occasionally, as on the facade of the Berthóty château in Frics (Fricovce), the decoration included human figures as well.
The decorative crenellation can also be found in Transylvania, although it spread there only during the reign of Gábor Bethlen, under the influence of ducal constructions.
The "Italian grades" appeared first on the ducal palace of Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia), but the other ducal palaces in Várad (Oradea), Alvinc (Vinþu de Jos), Balázsfalva (Blaj), etc., also had a crenellation over the main entablature.
Although this motif was still sometimes used in Transylvania in the eighteenth century, it never became as popular there as in Upper Hungary.
The castle of Sárospatak
Péter Perényi, who like many other lords kept changing allegiance between the two rival kings after the battle of Mohács, abandoned his family castle in Siklós because of the imminent Turkish threat and settled in the east, in Sárospatak.
From the mid-1530s on, he built the so-called Red Tower in the south-east part of the town.
This stout, strong building - in fact a residence tower - had several storeys with vaulted rooms in them.
In the great hall, the fireplaces and the richly moulded door and window frames, decorated with garlands and crowned by lunettes carrying the Perényi coat of arms, count among the highest quality Renaissance carvings in Hungary in the period following the battle of Mohács.
Still in the first half of the sixteenth century, new palace wings were attached to the tower; some stone carvings from them carry the dates 1540 and 1542.
The complex was significantly enlarged in the seventeenth century, when it was owned by the Rákóczi family.
At this time, the palace wings were extended further, and the so-called Lórántffy loggia was built, an exterior staircase with arcades resting on columns, leading up to the tower.
The interior decoration of the Red Tower itself was renewed at the same time, of which the most beautiful part was the recently restored tiled room.
The walls of this representative chamber - an audience room - were covered from top to bottom with oriental tiles.
(There were similar rooms in the ducal palace of Gyulafehérvár.)
Wooden ceilings, tapestries with gold thread, and magnificent furniture made the whole castle comfortable to live in.
The interior decoration is known to us from an inventory only, after a fire destroyed everything in the castle in 1703.
Only the rich painted vaulting of the corner room of the east wing, the so-called "Sub rosa" oriel, testifies to the original splendour of the palace of Zsuzsa Lórántffy.
The castle of Gyõr
Castles were by far the most important buildings of sixteenth-century Hungary; the dominant genre of architecture being military.
For many decades, enormous modern fortresses were built along the border of the territories under Turkish occupation. These buildings followed the principles of the great Italian sixteenth-century architects, Vignola and Serlio, and were in fact executed after the plans of Italian architects and according to the intentions of the Habsburg court.
The most important fortress defending the military road to Vienna was the castle of Gyõr; therefore, King Ferdinand I gave orders already in 1537 for the fortification of this castle.
Consequently, a new, modern fortification system that enclosed both the castle and the town was constructed.
The series of bastions around the town were built after the design of Pietro Ferrabosco in the 1550s, and was altered several times before the end of the century. The work was directed by the Italian architects of the Office of Military Architecture.
Within the walls, fortified by Italian bastions, the town itself was laid out on a geometrical ground-plan with a grid system of streets, according to the architectural principles of the Renaissance.
The Viennese Gate, finished in 1568, was a monumental edifice with high quality architectural details.
Its entrance was framed by rusticated pilasters, and there were enormous coats of arms, made of stone above its powerful entablature.
The Fehérvári Gate, on the other hand, had no decoration other than some rusticated pilasters.
These gates were the first examples in Hungary of a type of gate that later turned up on numerous castles and châteaux in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (in Sárvár and Németújvár/Güssing, Austria).
The fortress of Gyõr was still unfinished when the town was captured by the Turks in 1594.
Although the town was recaptured four years later, the bastions and the fortified walls received their final form only in the seventeenth century.
There were other symmetrically laid out fortresses in Komárom, Kanizsa, Érsekújvár (Nové Zámky, Slovakia), Tata, and elsewhere in the territory of Royal Hungary.
The castle of Várad (Oradea, Romania)
Várad, a bishopric seat on the edge of the Great Plains, became a gateway to Transylvania after the advance of the Turks.
The modernisation of the medieval fortress was begun under the reign of János Zsigmond.
Instead of the earlier, asymmetrical wall system which also incorporated the cathedral, a new, pentagonal fortification was planned with large bastions with corner projections on each corner.
The architect of the castle was in all likelihood Giulio Cesare Baldigara, who designed fortresses not only for the Duke of Transylvania, but also for the Habsburg court.
The construction was continued from 1571 under István Báthory (who as Polish king sent his Italian architects, first Domenico Ridolfini, then Simone Genga, to Várad from Cracow), but the fortress was still unfinished at the end of the century.
It was finally Gábor Bethlen who had the fortification completed. He also had an enormous pentagonal palace building (consisting of five wings with five corner towers) planned to be built on the site of the ruins of the medieval cathedral and the archiepiscopal palace, the type of symmetrically laid out building with which sixteenth-century Italian architects were preoccupied.
The finished parts of this new building were lavishly decorated; the activity of numerous painters and sculptors has been documented here.
Today a single surviving room with stucco decoration testifies to Gábor Bethlen's ambitious artistic programme.
Real and imaginary animals - elephants, leopards, griffins, unicorns - represent the "abundance of the whole world," as Pál Háportoni Forró, the history writer of the duke, put it in his writings about the castle of Várad.
During the time of György Rákóczi I, the inner castle was also more or less finished by 1660.
In the same year, after a siege of two months, Várad fell to the Turks.
The constructions of Gábor Bethlen
The short reign of just over one and half decades of Gábor Bethlen was characterised by feverish building activities.
János Szalárdi saw clearly the reason behind this: "Duke Gábor Bethlen... had at his seat in Fejérvár and in his castles at Radnót, Alvinc, Balázsfalva, Fogaras and Várad such grand, new, splendid houses erected ...and founded such magnificent buildings... which would promise him immortality."
The duke paid special attention to his seat Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia).
He enlarged the ducal palace that had been made uninhabitable by the political turmoil at the turn of the century, arranging the building complex around the three courts that are still distinguishable today.
He intended to turn the indefensible castle into a huge fortification, of which two bastions were completed during his reign.
He also renovated the cathedral and the water supply system, and had various ideas for an overall rearrangement of the town.
He provided a new building for the Collegium Academicum, his "Protestant university."
In other parts of Transylvania, too, he had several castles and châteaux constructed; the interior decoration of these enormous buildings was characterised by extravagant wealth.
In his building activities, Bethlen was also motivated by political ambitions: he realised that his artistic representation had to match these ambitions.
On the basis of written sources, we can form a clear idea of the luxury of the ducal court.
Not only goldsmiths from Kolozsvár (Cluj) worked regularly for Bethlen, but he also imported valuable goldsmith's works from abroad, for example, from Vienna.
He spent unheard of amounts on tapestries; for the series representing the story of Alexander the Great, for example, he paid 16,000 tallers.
He had luxurious objects sought and purchased for him everywhere from Venice to Constantinople.
Symmetrically laid out buildings with corner towers in Transylvania
The series of symmetrically laid out castles and châteaux with corner towers form a peculiar group within Transylvanian Renaissance architecture.
Chronologically the first of these is the château of Alvinc (Vinþu de Jos), planned for Gábor Bethlen, which was laid out on a ground plan of a hexagon inscribed into an oval. However, the building was never completed in this form.
Construction was started before 1617, but work was still in progress in the 1630s, when János Mezobándi Egerházi executed its coffered ceilings.
The rectangular château with four corner towers in Radnót (Iernut) was built between 1617-21 by Simon Péchi, the major patron of the Sabbatarians, then construction was continued by the duke himself.
In Várad (Oradea), work on the pentagonal ducal palace in the middle of the fortress, with five corner towers, began after 1618.
In Csíkszereda (Miercurea-Ciuc), the castle of Ferenc Mikó was laid out on a rectangular plan and built with four Italian bastions after 1613.
The Lónyay château in Aranyosmedgyes (Medieou Aurit) was also rectangular, with four strong corner towers. This building was finished, according to an inscription on the gate, in 1630.
All of the above mentioned buildings were constructed during the reign of Gábor Bethlen. The most monumental examples of this type were built for the duke himself; the others, for the members of his court.
Simon Péchi was Bethlen's chancellor until he fell from the duke's favour and the predecessor of Ferenc Mikó as the captain of Csík-Gyergyó-Kászonszék region. Zsigmond Lónyai was the count (ispán, comes parochialis) of Kraszna county.
These symmetrically laid out buildings are not the inventions of local, Transylvanian architecture; rather, their appearance can be explained by the presence of one of the Italian architects working in Transylvania, Giacomo Resti, from the Como region.
The architecture of Transylvania in the seventeenth century
The reign of György Rákóczi I was as much characterised by extensive building projects as his predecessor's had been.
The course of his constructions can be fairly well traced on the basis of contemporary documents, which also mention the numerous names of the architects involved.
Before his election as Duke of Transylvania, Rákóczi built on his family estates in Hungary, mainly in Sárospatak.
After 1630, he erected new buildings in Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia) and Fogaras (Fagarao).
In the beginning, Giacomo Resti, the architect of Gábor Bethlen, worked for him, but he soon left for Royal Hungary, and for a number of years we have no indications of an Italian master working in Transylvania.
There were, however, a number of local masters working on various buildings, such as "the lame mason, Anthony" from Dés, the "architect Master Matthias," or Gábor Haller, who had been trained abroad.
There were few trained architects in Transylvania and there were therefore continuous attempts to tempt masters from abroad.
The Gothic vaulting of the church in Farkas street in Kolozsvár (Cluj) was rebuilt, in the absence of local masters, by masons from Kurland.
Not until some time before 1648 did another Italian master, the Venetian Agostino Serena, arrive in Transylvania.
His activities there, however, cannot be connected to any newly erected building.
When in 1660 the Turks ravaged Transylvania, a great period came to an end.
The last monumental Late Renaissance château, in Bethlenszentmiklós (Sînmiclaus), was built after this event.
Its architect was the landholder Miklós Bethlen himself, the famous writer of memoirs, who learned the art of architecture when travelling in Europe.
His rectangular château, with corner towers, merges Venetian reminiscences with the local architectural traditions. Its two-storey, arcaded back facade, opening onto the Kisküküllõ river, make this building the most representative seventeenth-century residence in Transylvania.
Residential castles in seventeenth-century Hungary
The commissioners of Baroque art in Royal Hungary, especially in the western parts, were predominantly the Hungarian aristocrats who were loyal to the court.
The most notable among them were, primarily, the Esterházy as well as the Batthyány, Nádasdy, Zrínyi, and Pálffy families.
The interiors of their residential castles were especially decorated in the new style, while the exteriors preserved their fortified character because of the constant threat of war.
Inside, the representative series of rooms and the castle chapel often had a rich stucco decoration, as can be seen in the still standing castle of the Pálffys in Vöröskõ (Cervený Kamen, Slovakia).
Here the great hall was notable not only because of its location but also due to its sheer size. In its richly painted decoration historical scenes also appear (similarly to the Turkish battle scenes in Sárvár).
In many of these residences, a sala terrena, a kind of cooling room, was included at the lowest level, imitating a natural cave and richly decorated with marine iconography.
In the Pálffy castle, this room has also survived intact, with the frescos of Carpoforo Tencala decorating its ceiling.
The first new type of residence that also resembled a palace in its exterior appearance was the Esterházy château in Kismarton (Eisenstadt, Austria).
The original, rectangular medieval castle with four corner towers was used as a core to be surrounded by a series of rooms, both from inside and outside.
In its overall volume, the building preserved much of that of the old castle (the hidden corner towers were, for example, originally emphasised by onion domes above them), but the facade itself, with its giant pilasters rising through two storeys, the series of pedimented windows, and the monumental main entablature, received a unified Baroque character.
Within the building an enormous, two-storey high festive hall was included. Its ceiling was decorated by Carpoforo Tencala with a representative fresco cycle depicting the glorification of the Esterházy family.
The Jesuit church in Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia)
The Baroque style appeared in the visual arts in Hungary in the second quarter of the seventeenth century.
At that time, the stylistic elements of the Late Renaissance were still present, especially in Transylvania, and the new style achieved hegemony only at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
The first commissioners of Baroque art were the Catholic Church, the royal court, and the nobility loyal to the court who had reconverted to Catholicism. Its most important patrons were the Jesuits.
Traditionally, the beginning of Baroque art in Hungary is considered to be 1629, the year in which the construction of the Jesuit church was begun in Nagyszombat, the ecclesiastical centre of the country.
The patron of the construction was the palatine, Miklós Esterházy.
The design, by an anonymous Italian master, followed that of the Jesuit church in Vienna, and, through this church, the home church of the order, the Il Gesu in Rome.
The enormous, spacious nave of the church was covered by a barrel vault, and had a row of chapels on each side.
While the ground-plan is obviously of Roman origin, the facades and the exterior were formed in the artistic formal language of the territories north of the Alps.
Such a feature is the two towers on the main facade or the powerful entablatures that break trough the harmonic relationship of the classical orders.
The church in Nagyszombat became an example to follow for other Jesuit churches all over the country: the churches in Gyõr (1634-41), Trencsén (Trencín, Slovakia) (1653-57) and Kassa (Koice, Slovakia) (1653-57) were all modelled on this prototype.
The high quality interior decoration of the church of Nagyszombat was also much copied, especially the enormous high altar covering the whole wall of the sanctuary, with its outstanding altarpiece (The Baptism of Christ, 1640) and larger than life-size statues, as well as the rich stucco decoration of the chapels (1655).
The applied arts
The legacy of the applied arts of the period, especially of the seventeenth century, is unparalleled in its richness.
Although many significant works of furniture, textile, and ceramics survive, the most outstanding pieces, which can also be considered paradigmatic for the totality of the minor arts, are those of goldsmiths' work.
The majority of the most representative pieces were ordered by West-Hungarian aristocrats and prelates from the great European Late Renaissance and Baroque centres of metalcrafts, such as Nuremberg and Augsburg.
The Nádasdy, Batthyány, and Esterházy families commissioned work regularly from the goldsmiths of Augsburg, while the large cross of Márton Hetési Pethe, Archbishop of Kalocsa, is a work from Ulm (preserved in the Cathedral Treasury of Gyõr).
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, however, the local goldsmiths' guilds were also very active and produced first quality work.
The pitcher of Antal Losonczi (1548), measuring over a meter in height, is a masterpiece even by European standards, as is the enamelled golden chalice (1640) by István Brózer, a goldsmith of Kolozsvár (Cluj, Romania).
Sebestyén Hann, an outstanding goldsmith in the last third of the seventeenth century, was the member of one of the most important goldsmiths' guilds in Nagyszeben (Sibiu, Romania).
His plates and table decorations show the influence of the Augsburg workshops.
The most beautiful collection of goldsmiths' works from the period is preserved in the Esterházy treasury.
The various sixteenth- and seventeenth-century decorative dishes and jewellery (pendants and necklaces) in this aristocratic collection, the only one to have come down to us relatively intact, represent goldsmiths' works from nearly all of Europe, and mirror, on a smaller scale, the diverse artistic culture which generally characterised the Hungarian aristocratic courts in this period.
HISTORY OF MUSIC
The Music of the Hungarian Royal Court and the Principality of Transylvania
Music in Europe was universally an integral part of court life, and in this way almost inseparable from the everyday life of the reigning courts.
There was music on state holidays (coronations, inauguration of princes, weddings, funerals, celebrations of political occurrences, the reception of envoys) and also at church ceremonies.
The records speak of carnival dances as well as music to accompany dinners and other meals, music for dancing to follow meals and music for entertainment in the royal residence.
Hungary was no exception to setting a high value on musical life.
Numerous sources testify to the incidence of music in the post-1542 Hungarian royal courts, and to the music of the Principality of Transylvania that developed after the occupation of Buda in 1542.
The documents are, however, often few in number and show gaps chiefly because the pre-1655 court documents (household bills, notes and accounts of the royal courts, royal and aristocratic correspondence) were destroyed in the Turkish Wars as were the scores and lists of music.
Despite the often scant sources, it may be easily established that there was no Magyar monarch who did not retain at least some musicians in his service, or from whose reign no documents mentioning music have come down.
Even the strictly Calvinist rulers of Transylvania (György Rákóczi, Mihály Apafi) of the 17th century employed musicians - sometimes quite a few of them.
The desire to keep in contact with foreign countries and abreast of the European music life of the period was present and put in motion a fundamentally unified process despite the rather sharp political changes and relapses that were going on.
A good many sources demonstrate the aspiration of Hungarian rulers to take on excellent foreign musicians whenever possible.
The distribution of these foreign musicians according to the countries of their origins show an orientation toward the important music centers west or south of Hungary.
These musicians came chiefly from countries and regions near Hungary - from the southern parts of Germany, from Austria and Silesia, from Northern Italy (chiefly the Venetian Republic), and from Poland.
There is evidence that German (Silesian) musicians, and a couple of Italians from the times of John I of Szapolya and Isabel, established their presence in the courts of Wladislas II, Louis II and his queen Marie /Maria of Habsburg/.
In the courts of the Transylvanian princes (János Zsigmond, Zsigmond Báthory, Gábor Báthory, and Gábor Bethlen), Italian musicians appeared with just about the same frequency as did Germans, Silesians or Poles.
Although Transylvania was politically dependent on the Ottoman Empire, no trace survived in the Principality of Turkish music or Turkish musicians.
Until the end of the reign of Gábor Bethlen in Transylvania, there was nothing to indicate that Hungarian court music was particularly backward in comparison to other parts of Europe.
However, starting with the 1630s and the reign of György Rákóczi, the music of the Hungarian courts began to fall behind at a faster rate and eventually took an entirely different course.
From the middle of the century, the general - in fact almost exclusive - practice was to employ local musicians (Hungarians, Transylvanian Saxons and Romanians), and by that time the music life of the Transylvanian court showed a wide split from contemporaneous European music.
The number of musicians playing in the court ensembles remained unrecorded.
Although some of the Magyar rulers had apparently only a few musicians, the full number of their instrumentalists was in some cases close to thirty, a fairly high figure according to the international standards of the times.
There is no doubt about the fact that the court ensembles were not of a random composition: there are documents to show that the Hungarian rulers regularly sought out suitable singers and instrumentalists both at home and abroad.
Their concern also extended to the education of young musicians.
They enquired about talented new blood chiefly in the towns, and sometimes even imported replacements from abroad.
The court ensembles should not be regarded as accidental groups of musicians collected just for the duration of some event.
Many of them, including the imported performers, served for long years - sometimes for decades - in the same place.
There is a regrettable lack of information about most of these musicians.
Often not even their full name is known, and there are no data about their careers.
Still, it has been established about some of them that before they were offered employment in Hungary, they had been active in such major centres of music as Rome, Ferrara, Mantua, Munich, Vienna and Graz.
The ruling courts suited the sorts of performers they employed to the different kinds of music they wanted to hear.
Of course, this was the general practice all over Europe.
The capellas played a special role in Catholic courts.
The cantors, under the direction of the choir leader priests, performed chiefly at Mass, but it became a general practice for them as early as in the 1400s to perform, together with choir-boys from schools, on other occasions, such as feasts and festivities as well.
Most of the cantors - as demonstrated by the frequent modification of the word by the Latin adjective musicus - were trained musicians.
In the case of the Calvinist princes of Transylvania, the records speak of only a single court cantor and a few apprentice cantors who did not take part in secular events.
Only the courts of Wladislas II, Louis II and the latter's queen, Marie, have gone on record for their choirs set up to perform polyphonic church and secular madrigals after the 1500s.
It is interesting that Louis and his queen had separate singers - just as Matthias and Beatrix did in an earlier period.
In the courts that existed after the disastrous Battle of Mohács in 1526, there may have been singers in the service of Zsigmond Báthory. There are data hinting at the existence of such performers in the second decade of Gábor Bethlen's reign (from 1624 onward).
The few German and Italian singers in the employ of the Calvinist Bethlen performed obviously outside of the liturgy.
The magister capellae directed the musicians in the employ of the court.
As this Latin term or its German equivalent are but infrequently used in Hungarian sources, the head of the musical performers is - with the exception of several cases - impossible to identify.
Thomas Stoltzer, the famous Silesian composer who was Queen Marie's musician from 1522 to 1526, is known today principally for his Noli Emulari, a work composed on the Queen's order, and passed down to posterity.
The trumpeters and the drummers attached to them were always a distinct unit of the musicians performing in royal courts.
Their numbers were more or less constant: the king, and the reigning prince of Transylvania, generally had from five to nine trumpeters in the 16th century; and later their number increased to about eight or twelve.
They were joined by one or two kettle drummers and in some cases several infantry drummers.
Not only the ruler had his trumpeters, the Queen, and later the wife of the reigning prince of Transylvania also had theirs.
These signalling instruments were considered essential requisites in court.
Gábor Bethlen wrote for posterity: We cannot go about without the fanfare of drums and trumpets.
Transylvanian sources of the 17th century present the kettle drum as a symbol of power on a par with the flag. In the age of the Rákóczis and Mihály Apafi it was often called the State Drum - and the kettle-drummer the State Drummer.
Trumpet and drum signals directed the armies - as well as the daily routine in the courts.
They were used to indicate the passage of time and the arrival of delegations.
They warned of the approach of danger and hailed rulers of peaceful intent when they arrived with their entourages.
In the courts of Gábor Bethlen and George Rákóczi I, there were also three or four German and Polish trumpeters in addition to the local ones.
According to contemporaneous German practice, they probably played polyphonic music as an ensemble.
Less clear is the role of the woodwind players (then called pipers or Turkish pipers).
Similar to the infantry drummers, they must have been connected with the troops in service at the court, and obviously had a role in issuing commands to the forces.
In addition they played music for dancing, too.
Starting with the mid-17th century, Transylvanian documents even refer to bagpipes.
Another group of court musicians - the sources call them simply musicians - played secular music to enhance the dignity of certain occasions or for entertainment.
This group contained the largest number of non-Hungarians, and included the players of keyboard instruments, plucked instruments, strings and of lutes.
(There are data referring to the latter from the court of King János Szapolyai (John of Szapolya).
This group reflects the most closely how the personality of different sovereigns prompted them to listen to different types of music.
Only music-loving monarchs like Zsigmond Báthory or Gábor Bethlen employed such musicians in significant numbers.
Probably because of the popularity of keyboard instruments, their players - whom the sources call organists or virginalists regardless of the actual instrument they played - were integral to the court ensembles in Hungary.
They certainly performed liturgical music as well, though providing secular performances was their main responsibility.
Because of the practical utilisation and great popularity of the instrument in the period, lute-players figured in the annals of history, up to the reign of Prince George Rákóczi I in the 1630s, in most of the courts - sometimes with several performers at the same time.
Bálint Bakfark (1526/1530-1576), perhaps the finest lute player of the period, was the only Hungarian musician able to rise to the top in his times. He descended from a Brassó (today Brasov, Romania) family, and studied in the court of King John already as a child, probably from 1536 onward. His music master was an Italian whose name is not on record, and Bakfark remained devoted to the style of music he had been taught.
The Italian influence is detectable even in his later works written after 1549 when he was already engaged abroad.
It is considerably more difficult to create a reliable image of the string players, especially as the term violinist generally used to denote them renders the identification of the instrument or instruments they played very difficult.
Hungarian sources (especially those of the 17th century) mention strings of various types and sizes, for instance, small violin, large violin, Bassgeige, violone, and viola da gamba, which may have been all in use in the reigning courts of the period.
It is more than likely that most of the court musicians played several instruments, always picking the one necessary at the moment.
Probably, instrumentalists also sang when required, in some cases in several voices, as singing was an integral part of musical performances during the period.
At coronations, the inauguration of reigning princes, weddings in the royal family, visits by dignitaries, and other important events, court musicians were joined by auxiliaries borrowed from the upper nobility or from the townships.
It was also customary to invite a good number of foreign musicians. For György Rákóczi's wedding in 1643, for instance, a complete ensemble arrived from Vienna.
High-ranking persons visiting Hungary were often accompanied by their musicians, joining their masters, of course, only on the scene.
Itinerant musicians or performers passing through on a long journey, rarely missed calling at the courts on their way.
It is on record, for instance, that Queen Isabel was visited by Sebestyén Tinódi-Lantos, that eminent Hungarian chronicler of long-past and contemporaneous occurrences, who summarized in his Transylvanian History what he had seen and heard at the court in Transylvania.
The kind of music actually heard and listened to at the courts is, however, far less well known in contrast to the multitude of data available on the role of musicians and events associated with the performance of music.
Missing are the scores of music used in the courts. Only one or two early religious reference books containing a few scores have survived, nor has anyone gained access to lists of court music.
Likewise, there are no data on scores musicians may have owned, although some of them certainly acquired such auxiliary material.
Hard to find are any reports on the music heard or reviews of the performances given in Hungarian royal or princely courts.
Identifiable instances of liturgic music presented as part of the religious services constitute the only exception.
The Gregorian melodies sung in a single voice at Catholic castles were a regular part of Mass.
In the case of the Protestant reigning princes of Transylvania, psalms and other songs sung by Protestant congregations performed a similar role.
The song of grace Te Deum Laudamus regularly sung throughout Europe was also often heard at major state and political events or at great festivities in Hungary.
In regard to works of music, one usually does not merely ask what was heard, but is equally interested in the answer given to the question what kind of performers the interpreters were, what their performance was like. Obviously the possibilities varied from performance to performance.
In ideal cases probably every part or voice of a given vocal work was sung, but obviously such renderings were rarely possible.
The musicians of old, however, did not regard this kind of curtailment as a handicap: they were used to much greater freedom in the treatment of compositions than is given today.
The works were only a starting point from which the variation they intended to play was developed.
Vocal scores were, for instance, often replaced with instruments, nor was it in any way unusual to omit one voice or several voices from a given performance. The radical abbreviation of the works was also common practice, and a lot of compositions were otherwise transformed or transcribed.
There is reason to believe that music was often transcribed to a single-keyboard or plucked instrument.
Several Hungarian kings and reigning princes were themselves qualified in the use of instruments.
Although their education had focused above all on Government, areas of political orientation, and military affairs, they could have ill afforded neglecting the subjects of general culture, music included.
Louis II, Zsigmond Báthory and Andrew Báthory were, for instance, noted for their love of music.
János Zsigmond is reputed to have played the flute to perfection, and a contemporaneous master is alleged to have described him excellent both as a vocalist and instrumentalist.
In 1561 a visitor calling on him in some political matter gratified him with the gift of a fine lute.
About Zsigmond Báthory an Italian musician in his employ wrote that the Prince played several instruments and composed works that vied with music written by the finest composers.
In fact even musicians serving other masters presented Báthory with dedications of their works. The Kapellmeister of the imperial court Philip de Monte dedicated a volume of his madrigals (Decimosettimo Libro de Madrigali, Venice 1595) to Báthory.
Girolamo Diruta went further: he not only dedicated his organ school to the Transylvanian ruler, but entitled an original work Il Transilvano in honour of the Prince.
András Báthory, a cousin of Zsigmond's, played the virginal, and in 1584 Palestrina himself, that giant of Renaissance music, dedicated to him a publication and a work included in it.
Some of the queens and prince consorts hailing from countries outside of Hungary (e.g., Marie Krisztierna, and Catherine of Brandenburg) are also on record as music lovers and skilled instrumentalists.
From 1527 on, the court of the kings of the Habsburg Dynasty who ruled part of Hungary used to stay the most frequently in Vienna or Prague.
Consequently the Habsburg musicians did not play an important part in the music life of Hungary.
The King and his court including the royal ensemble appeared, however, in Hungary for any coronation in Pozsony (today Bratislava, Slovakia) and to attend some sessions of the Diet regularly meeting in that town.
On these occasions, the musicians played to the deputies of the upper nobility and established contacts with their musicians.
There are a variety of documents to testify to the contacts between the court musicians of the Habsburgs and other Viennese performers with the Hungarian aristocracy, principally with members of the Nádasdy, Batthyány and Esterházy families.
Besides Krakow and Venice, especially Vienna and Prague, the seats of the Habsburg kings of Hungary, played major roles in supplying the courts in Hungary with music.
The reigning princes of Transylvania often invited musicians from Vienna or had their agents seek out suitable musicians there.
Concrete data indicate that they had some of their instruments and violin and viola strings - largely German or Italian products - purchased in Vienna or Prague.
Music in the Life of the Nobility
Music was a natural accompaniment to everyday events in the courts and residences of the Hungarian aristocracy.
Music and dancing concluded not only the great weddings and other parties - where the provision of music was usually a lavish affair - but was performed even at intimate dinners.
The 17th century palace, castle and mansion inventories often refer to the ornamental wooden galleries in the biggest hall of the building where the musicians were seated on festive occasions as the dancing palace or dance house.
The men and women of the nobility not only found delight in the performances of the musicians, but many of them were themselves skilled in the use of an instrument.
Music in the courts of the magnates was not so strictly regulated as at royal and princely courts where it was a mandatory part of life.
The variety in the number of musicians employed depended primarily on the personal wishes - modest or ambitious - of family members.
There were no set rules according to one's rank in the hierarchy of the nobility on the standard of music provided, the number of musicians employed or the composition of the ensembles at any party.
Apart from the mention of trumpeters and drummers, the sources do not contain any data about musicians in the courts of rich peers enjoying great power through the posts of national importance they filled (e.g. being in the service of Palatine Tamás Nádasdy and his son Ferenc, or of the Batthyánys, before the end of the 16th century).
There were no church musicians in residence with the nobility - except for a few families of the upper nobility such as the Nádasdys, the Batthyánys, Esterházys, and Thökölys in the 17th century.
Apparently the nobility, the leading aristocrats included, employed just the number and quality of musicians the occasion demanded.
Miklós Esterházy's account in 1627 demonstrates this: We were guests in the ignominious company of a great many drums and trumpets, and there was likewise an abundance of tambourine-playing Turkish singers, Gypsy violinists, and the kind of dulcimer players who are no better than pub-loafers.
Musicians belonged to the middle strata of the court people. Some violin players and pipers not only received regular annuities, but were sometimes even deemed worthy of endowments of a house or a piece of land.
Nor should Sebestyén Tinódi-Lantos, who had served for a long time at the court of Bálint Török, be regarded as poor as he was fond of claiming in his poems: after all, he managed to purchase a valuable house in the 1550s in Kassa (today Kosice, Slovakia).
Ambrus Lantos Görcsöni and his family were granted nobility in 1557 through the intermediation of Gáspár Homonnay-Drugeth.
King Ferdinand conferred a coat of arms and peerage on Tinódi - probably owing to the musician's patrons among the aristocracy.
The performers at the distinguished residences were not exclusively locals.
Foreigners appeared in the ranks of string, plucked-instrument, and keyboard players just as frequently as among the trumpeters, and were even employed as ensemble directors.
Foreigners were employed not only by magnate families living close to the western frontiers, but also in the courts of the aristocracy in districts free of Turkish rule.
German-Austrian and Italian musicians prevailed, but there were also Poles and South-Slavs.
Probably not everyone who is denoted as Hungarian in the sources was actually Magyar.
Probably only families of the lower nobility employed exclusively locals as they had no more than a couple or so musicians and could not pick and choose.
Some aristocrats in the parts of the country close to the Turkish-occupied areas employed musicians, tambourine players, or singers with tambourines or lutes.
Some of them were apparently captives.
There is no doubt that Turkish music did affect the upper nobility who came into contact with the Turks.
Some evidence for this is provided by the Turkish song marks used in the poems of Bálint Balassi and also by a letter dating from 1596 by György Zrínyi in which he writes in glowing terms about his Turkish tambour player by the name of Bajazet: More beautiful than whose playing I had never heard and, I believe, nowhere else on this earth of ours would anyone hear better.
A contemporaneous entry in a diary (1687) mentions a Court Comedy (probably an oratorio) performed at János Pálffi's palace in honour of the imperial victory over the enemy - in all probability at the recapture of Buda in 1686.
The same historical turning point was celebrated in a Mass written by the Italian composer Matteo Simonelli.
On the other hand, it is well-nigh impossible to present a more or less reliable picture of the kind of music performed by local musicians, not to mention works originally written here in Hungary in the 16th and 17th centuries.
It is about the bards that the sources provide the most information. The Cronica written by Tinódi who spent long years in the service of aristocrats, and published in Kolozsvár in 1554, has, for instance, preserved some of the bard's melodies with the words attached.
(His song about the Battle of Egervár is still remembered in Transylvania as a folk melody though with different words.)
Apart from Tinódi's works, the melodies of a good many verse-chronicles by other authors have been preserved elsewhere.
Travelling - an everyday affair for aristocrats - usually involved the enjoyment of music, too.
The 16th-century accounts of the Nádasdy family refer to student bards and village musicians as well as municipal trumpeters from the towns of Kolozsvár, Nagyszeben and Szászsebes, and the trumpeters, lute players and violinists of other noble families.
There are also data on lute and other plucked-instrument players from Vienna; Viennese musicians and Polish performers visiting the imperial capital, and about the tower musicians of the city and St. Stephan's Cathedral.
At the Pozsony diets (1554, 1561, 1569, 1572), in addition to the tower musicians from the town and the pipers of the Castle, the King's trumpeters, discantors, singers, violin players, and the frequently mentioned Italian violinists entertained the Palatine and his son.
In those days, Vienna offered the delights of music primarily to those who frequented the Habsburg court, such as national officials.
(The Esterházys preserved the librettos of several 17th-century operas performed in the court of the Habsburgs.)
Those who travelled on diplomatic missions, and the Hungarian students of the nobility who studied at foreign universities and colleges, also had access to plenty of musical experience.
There are diaries, letters, accounts and other papers to testify to their presence at festivities in Vienna, Germany, Venice and Rome. Some of them had the chance to attend operatic performances in Vienna or Italy, and many took music and dancing lessons abroad.
At home, these students turned the skills they had acquired abroad to good use.
As a number of sources reveal, the everyday life of aristocratic courts was enhanced by the amateur concerts of family members and other householders.
Young people who had not had the chance to stay abroad for any length of time, had the alternative of applying to municipal musicians or receiving instruction from court musicians, relatives, or members of the court who had already acquired some skill in playing music.
Johannes Wohlmuth, the organ player in Sopron, for instance, gave Clavir (piano or clavichord) lessons to Pál Esterházy's two sons.
Apparently, the nobility had some predilection for individual solo performances.
Chamber music, instrumental performances in small or larger ensembles, were hardly in vogue at the time.
The immense lists and accounts of the castles, palaces and mansions - in which the material referring to music has not yet been properly researched - mention, apart from drums and trumpets, chiefly keyboard instruments (clavichords, pairs of virginals, small wind-blown organs) and plucked instruments (mostly lutes, and in some cases lyres, perhaps harps).
Strings figure infrequently (although violins are referred to in the documents); and, except for trumpets, winds hardly appear in the inventories.
The instruments - sometimes including valuable ornamental pieces - must have chiefly served the private pleasure of family members.
Church music
When the Turks occupied the Roman Catholic centre of Esztergom in 1543, the Archbishopric and the Collegiate Church together with the school were resettled in Nagyszombat.
Although earlier the running of the Esztergom cathedral was regarded as a model for the churches and dioceses of the country, the general deterioration and the inevitable reduction of the staff that accompanied the onslaught of Turkish occupation in the mid-16th century, hampered music life in the church.
These negative processes were accelerated by the spread of the Reformation, which was beginning to affect the Court in Buda and some of the towns of Upper Hungary as early as the 1520s and 1530s.
By the 1570s, the religious affiliation of the population showed a sharply altered pattern.
The Catholic majority was maintained only in the neighbourhood of Nagyszombat (today Trnava, Slovakia), Pozsony (today Bratislava, Slovakia), Gyõr, and among the Székelys of Transylvania.
Until the Peace Treaty of Vienna in 1606, Protestants were considerably restricted in the practice of their religion.
At the time of the Thirty Years' War, however, Protestants from Silesia, Bohemia, and Austria were already seeking asylum in Hungary. These religious refugees included such significant church musicians as Samuel Capricornicu and Andreas Rauch.
In consequence of the Turkish occupation and the partition of Hungary, the country's musical centres moved to peripherial districts.
Gregorian songs and Strophic Folksinging in Hungarian in the Protestant congregations
Folk singing, Gregorian songs, and strophic singing in Hungarian began to flourish in the rendering of Protestant congregations almost simultaneously with the emergence of the Reformation and soon manifested itself in printed songbooks.
The earliest document of the new repertory following the cancios of the late Middle Ages consisted of songs associated with Luther (the István Gálszécsi collection from 1536, known only in fragments). This was interesting because Reformation-period singing in Germany did not have a significant influence upon the choral material of Hungarian reformed congregations, affecting them even less than Czech-Hussite singing did.
It was the tenets and liturgy of the Reformation that helped to develop the special genres of the new treasury of folk songs, the psalms and graces that precede and follow the sermon, and also the catechistic songs.
The printed hymn books of the 16th century designed for the use of congregations contained every type of song, and were edited in an arrangement that indicated the genre and the holy day for which each was intended. This was the case with the 1560 and 1574 songbooks by Gál Huszár including melodies by early Protestant composers as contemporaneously recorded; the songbooks from the Hungarian town of Debrecen from the 1560s; and the songbook edited by György Gönczi-Kovács from 1590.
As a result of the Lutheran Reformation, medieval Latin Gregorian chants became widely applied and translated into the mother tongue in about the mid-16th century.
The Hungarian repertory of the Gregorian chants was passed down in graduals in manuscript or printed form, and maintained its hold firmly in both the Lutheran and Helvetian branches of the Reformation. From this period derive the two earliest complete sources, namely, Márton Kálmáncsehi's 1560 compilation printed as an appendix to Gál Huszár's 1560 collection: Reggeli éneklések (Morning Songs, Debrecen 1561), and the first part of Huszár's 1574 songbook.
Each of the two books focus on one form of two types of religious services: Holy Mass and chant.
The issue of The Old Gradual (Az Öreg Gradual, 1636) in the Principality of Transylvania, was by then an obsolete attempt at saving the choral material of the Reformed Church in a unified form.
The joint aims of puritanism and the introduction of the Geneva psalm book (Psalterium Ungaricum. Hungarian translation by Albert Szenci-Molnár, Herborn 1607; first Hungarian edition with scores: Lõcse 1652) hastened the fall into neglect in the 17th century of the medieval Gregorian heritage and of the verse-songs of such early-Reformation-period composers as Gál Huszár, András Batizi, Gergely Szegedi, András Szkárosi-Horváth, and Péter Bornemisza.
Gregorian Chants and Strophic Folksinging in the Catholic Church
The Nagyszombat Synod of 1629 put an end to the continued cultivation of the Latin Gregorian chants when it decided in favor of introducing the Roman rite as recommended by the Trident Synod (Tridentinum).
In Hungary, only the Franciscan Order had traditions that helped to preserve the customs and melodic versions of the Roman Gregorian chant.
Available sources verify that the Zagreb bishopric, which had been saved from Turkish occupation, remained attached to its own liturgic traditions in its music. The Paulian Order on the other hand made arduous efforts to adjust the old melodic traditions from the Archbishopric of Esztergom to the Roman rites.
Gregorian chants were losing ground in most of the Catholic churches in Hungary, a process that was accelerated by the new approach and organization of the humanist schools of the Jesuits.
At the same time, the use of the mother tongue and of strophic folksongs began to gain emphasis in the choral practice of the Catholic churches, especially in small towns and villages.
The 1560 Synod of Nagyszombat made compulsory the submission of church songs to official approval.
Catholic folk-singing received a new impetus during Counter Reformation. In order to make up for the lag of two centuries in comparison to the Protestants, two synods (those of 1629 and 1638, both at Nagyszombat) proposed the publication of a songbook.
A compilation including scores was published under the title Cantus Catholici as edited in 1651 by the Jesuit Benedek Szõlõsy (1609-1656).
The book sampled the oldest Catholic song repertory and the heritage passed down in manuscripts as well as the outstanding contributions of Hungarian Baroque poetry (e.g., the works of Canon Mátyás Nyéki-Vörös /1575-1654/).
Later editions provided reference material for folk-singing for some hundred-and-fifty years.
A similar role was played by Psalms and Funeral Songs (Soltári és halottas énekek, 1693).
Position of Polyphonic Music
The major Catholic and Lutheran municipal churches attributed special importance to the practice of vocal and instrumental music in several voice parts.
Townships advocated the close integration of church and school, and served as patrons of church music, though this patronage was influenced by denominational differences and fluctuations of the majority religion.
Towards the end of the period, there were special endowments supported by church dignitaries (e.g., György Széchényi's foundations - 1684, 1695) to maintain the choirs and musicians of Catholic churches.
As confirmed by the rules and regulations of the school in Nagyszombat issued by Archbishop Miklós Oláh and also by the known rules of German Lutheran town schools, performances of vocal music, and particularly the rehearsals of liturgic works sung in several parts, had an important role in school instruction.
St. Martin's Church belonging to the associated chapters of several Orders in the city of Pozsony kept up choral practice in several voice parts according to the liturgy (see Vesperale, Anna Hannsen Schuman Codex, 1571, containing 200 motets in imitation-Low-Countries style).
As to the surviving mementos of such music, valuable are the collections of the Lutheran towns in Counties Szepes and Sáros in then Upper Hungary. The 16th century items of the Bártfa Collection show the quick adaptation of the motets of German Reformation.
The Lõcse collection - largely of the 17th century - shows evidence of the study of religious music styles - chiefly through the works of Italian and German composers - over some one-hundred years. The assortment has also preserved some works by local and regional composers such as Samuel Capricornus, Johann Kusser, Sameue Marckfelner, Johann Schimbracky, Andreas Neoman, and Zacharius Zarewutius.
In addition to the manuscripts and the printed sheets of the period, there is access to surviving Hungarian compositions, the collections of scores from the Pozsony Lutheran Church (1651, 1652, 1657), the Lutheran Church of Eperjes (1661), and the German Lutheran school of Brassó (1575-1630), all proving that the major works of early Baroque religious music (Claudio Monteverdi, Alessandro Grandi, Samuel Scheidt, Johann Hermann Schein, Heinrich Schütz, and Andreas Hammerschmidt ) and their methods of composition (concertato motets accompanied with a continuo in just a few voice parts, and motets with several choirs) reached Hungary.
As opposed to German anthologies of analogous character, the kind of polyphony or its absence did not vary with the individual denominations.
The homophonous though polyphonic choral practices - the same melodic line to the accompaniment of several voice parts - with German, Latin, Czech, or Hungarian words of the musical material of the Protestant churches in the northern region, are recorded in the choral books of Leibitz or Liubica from the 1680s a well as in the Eperjes Gradual of 1635-1652.
Religious Orders
From the turn of the 16th century into the 17th, the Jesuits conducted regular singing and music lessons in an increasing number of municipal schools (starting in 1561 at Nagyszombat, and also in Gyõr and Kassa).
With the aim of organising high-standard choral and instrumental ensembles in the churches and performing polyphonic music on important religious holidays, they sought to make their own arrangements independently of the municipal leadership.
Although according to the 1659 stipulations of the Nagyszombat chapter of the Marist rule, the performance for Mass of polyphonic and instrumental music and the use of the organ were permitted only on important holidays.
The Missa franciscana spread widely in the course of the 17th century.
Organo Missale (1667) by Joannes Kaioni, a Franciscan monk from Transylvania, Missale Choralisticum by Valerian Dubelovicz (MS, 1673), of Szombathely; and Liber Sacrorum Choralium (1691) by Edmund Benyovicz (Beovi) from Nagyszombat serve as the earliest known sources of typically Franciscan-style Masses and litanies, antiphones and other pieces.
The repertory encompassed compositions based on Gregorian melodies of strophic structure, or resembling the Baroque Concertato.
Four compositions for Mass have come down by Frantisek Vogler (1623-1688), a man of Moravian descent working between 1649 and 1654 as an organist of the Franciscans in Pozsony.
Some works of Joannes Kaioni (Codex Caioni, 1634-1671; Sacri Concentus, 1669; and Cantionale Catholicum, 1676) provide an important key to the musical culture of the Transylvanian Franciscans, their close contacts with the Upper Hungary of the times, and to the influence they had on Transylvanian choral music.
Music in the Cities and Towns of Hungary
Hungarian towns had a widely varied music life in the period of the Turkish conquest in the 16th and 17th centuries.
There were religious, and also legal and political reasons for the differences.
The Catholic and Lutheran towns began to use polyphony in their church and school music somewhat later than the rest of Europe. At the same time, the Reformed-Church (Calvinist) and Unitarian settlements insisted on strictly single-voice performances without recourse to instruments, and strove to limit the use of festive music for entertainment even when addressed to the general population.
Music life was rich and varied in the free royal towns.
These largely German-Protestant - generally Lutheran - settlements had their own organists, choirmasters and tower musicians, each producing music of a high standard in church and at town festivities with the participation of schoolboys who had regular choral practice.
The city councils strove to employ well-trained musicians.
In addition to the locally trained young people intended for replacement, successful performers from other parts of the country as well as a significant number of non-Hungarians were employed.
The foreigners came largely from the near-by Austrian, South-German and Silesian territories, and sometimes from yet further afield.
The changes caused by the Counter Reformation gaining impetus in the 17th century forced many to leave their homeland or place of work, and the opportunities to perform in Hungary were therefore welcomed.
The tower musicians (tower warden and his men) originally had the duty of keeping watch and producing widely audible signals, but with the passage of time their activity shifted to the field of music.
According to the evidence of a good many sources, these musicians were proficient in the use of various instruments.
The lists from 17th-century Transylvania (Segesvár - 1627, 1643, 1644; Nagyszeben - 1631) mention chiefly winds (trumpet, pozan, pommer, Schalmei, zink, bassoon, Blockflöte) , but made references to strings as well.
Today it seems clear that the tower musicians were not only skilled in producing the simple conventional signals or fanfares, but also commanded an extensive knowledge of music, many of them even being able to read scores.
These were skills necessary for their work in the churches, involving the performance of high-quality music, which in turn was part of their job in the royal towns.
The proficiency in music of tower musicians is verified by the decrees and decisions of several cities. The people of Sopron, for instance, made mention of their practice of playing music in several voice parts.
The contract for one of the tower musicians in Sopron (1549) prescribed that distinguished visitors to the town should be welcomed with music in four voice parts.
Another tower musician emphasized in an application for a position (1599) that he provided five-part music instead of the usual four.
In 1601 the Sopron Council decided that fine motets and madrigals should be performed on Sundays and other holidays as well as during the week.
The city of Pozsony supplied its own evidence for the tower musicians' skill in reading music when it purchased new motets for them to replace the outdated Josquin and Senfl works, in 1569.
The list from Besztercebánya (1683) left in his will by Matthias Fabri, Instrumentalist Musicus, refers to several works of music originating from that town. Old trumpet scores were found in the legacy (1672) of Andreas Schwartz, trumpeter in the employ of the Transylvanian town of Beszterce.
The Codex Vietoris from the 1670s preserved fanfares for two trumpets, and features scores written according to the tabulator (rule table) then used for organs, a system whose writing and reading required special skills.
A large number of sources verify that musicians active in different towns maintained contact with each other.
They certainly exchanged the pieces to which they had access.
This must be the explanation for the striking similarities between the Hungarian collections compiled in different places.
Of course, frequent travel also helped to widen contacts.
The town musicians often performed even at royal courts.
Local musicians were expected to provide table music for high-ranking personages visiting in the city, ranging from the Monarch and the Palatine, down to princes and others.
These occasions benefited the musicians as they were paid extra fees for the special performances.
There is recorded evidence of this practice. The accounts of the Polish Prince Zsigmond for the years 1500-1505 mention fees paid out to musicians in Buda, Esztergom and Nyitra. The records of the travel expenses of Palatine Tamás Nádasdy include such payments. The household accounts of Mihály Apafi, reigning prince of Transylvania, mention sums reserved for the organ-player from Segesvár and various musicians from Nagyszeben.
It was largely up to the town councils to supply the necessary scores.
Not much is known, however, about the methods of acquisition.
Printed matter may have been imported from abroad, but it is also possible that the prints came from local merchants.
Instances of a town purchasing the scores from the legacy of certain citizens are also on record.
The town of Bártfa, for example, bought three printed volumes bound together from the local schoolmaster.
Some of the scores derived from presents. It was a custom for out-of-town musicians, chiefly foreigners, but also locals, to send gifts of printed or manuscript music to the local council, a gesture which may have suggested the expectation that it would not remain unrequited.
Of course, the town musicians - the users - were the most active in enlarging the stock of recorded music.
The organists and choirmasters copied virtually everything within their reach, and some collections of scores are known to have been compiled by a town scribe who appreciated music.
Some of these manuscripts in scores or in tablature form for the organ have come down to us as did the collection at Lõcse (today, Levoca Slovakia) and the Codex Vietoris.
The town, church and school libraries of the 16th and 17th centuries (Bártfa, Lõcse), the collections known from contemporaneous lists (Besztercebánya, Brassó, Eperjes, Körmöcbánya, Pozsony), and some individual manuscripts that have come down to posterity - for instance, the Anna Hannsen Schuman Codex, as well as fragments accidentally found at various places - add up to a tremendous store of music, most of it from the European repertory.
The collections reveal the names of numerous musicians, including Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Gabrielli, Jacobus Gallus-Handl, Andreas Hammerschmidt, Hans Leo Hassler, Orlando di Lasso, Luca Marenzio, Claudio Monterverdi, Hieronymus Praetorius, Jacob Regnart, Johann Hermann Schein, Samuel Scheidt, Heinrich Schütz, and Adrian Willaert.
Besides foreigners, we also know about local composers: many of the organists and choirmasters wrote music, and much of their work has survived to this day.
Included among them were such highly rated 17th-century composers as Andreas Rauch (Sopron), Samuel Capricornus (Pozsony), and Johann Kusser (Körmöcbánya, Sopron, and Pozsony).
There were very few makers and repairers of instruments in Hungary in this period.
Repair was carried out by town craftsmen who were the most skilled in the woodwork, metalwork, or leather fashioning required, or by the musicians themselves.
The townships often expected the organists to tune instruments and make minor repairs.
For general repair and maintenance, foreign experts were invited in.
In Upper Hungary chiefly Poles were active in this trade, while in Western Hungary, Austrians.
The records show that a lot of tower musicians had a penchant for repair.
Some musicians demonstrated their skill in the trade by building self-made instruments. This was done, for instance, by Johannes, the organist from Beszterce, who was sometimes referred to as "the organ-builder". In 1549, the town bought a wind-blown organ from him for 40 forints, in order to present the instrument to János Zsigmond, the young reigning prince of Transylvania.
From the middle of the 16th century on, the organist Matias Burián and his son Hieronymus started to build organs and other keyboard instruments.
A century later, Adam Bessler, tower musician for Kassa (today Kosice, Slovakia), and then Eperjes, became known for the strings he made, and afterwards for his plucked instruments.
In contrast with the royal cities, the agricultural towns - with a majority of Hungarians - did not retain musicians.
This was the case with Catholic settlements as well as Protestant localities.
Where there were any institutions for music, they were maintained by the master of the estate that accommodated the township. Thus the Reigning Prince of Transylvania was in control of Gyulafehérvár, the Rákóczis at Sárospatak, the Bishop in Nagyszombat, and the Bishop and the collegiate church in Gyõr.
The extent and quality of musical activities depended in every case on the people who ran these institutions.
Although the musicians of any given locality performed at the festivities of the municipality as well as at private parties and ceremonies, the functions of music did not reflect the needs of the town.
Documents prove that there were large numbers of independent musicians, lute-players, violinists and lute-playing bards in both the free royal towns and the market towns.
It is notable, for instance, that Sebestyén Tinódi-Lantos, and Sebestyén Hegedûs, a bard active in the same period, both lived at Kassa.
They had different occupations, and performed music only incidentally.
The references, found scattered in a variety of municipal documents, provide only a sketchy picture about just exactly what they did.
There are a number of records, however, hinting at their rivalry with the town musicians, who did not like to share the profits to be made.
The case was that the tower musicians together with the organist and cantor did not only fulfil their official duties, but also often played at weddings and on other festive occasions at the request of ordinary citizens and guilds - for pay, of course.
This purpose of everyday entertainment was served by the variety of musical material preserved in the Codex Vietoris, the Lõcse Tabulatur Book, and the lost Iván Nagy manuscript.
It is by no means easy to distinguish between what independent professional musicians in the employ of towns did from the amateur musical activities of the general population.
The sources suggest two levels: the musical performances of fairly well educated townspeople (students, tradespeople and craftsmen) and the section of the population practicing folk music as we think of the term today.
Although we do not have as yet a reliable overview of the musical accomplishments of the educated burghers, the fragmentary data available suggest that there was a section of people in the towns - mostly, though not exclusively, German - who manifested a real interest in and demand for European music and were able to read music - even the special organ and lute scores.
There are data to prove that these townspeople sang in several voice parts; and there are legacies passed down that reveal remnants of instruments and scores, among them pieces of polyphonic music in manuscript form and printed scores - some of them probably school work, others foreign prints.
In the settlements located in the Turkish-occupied parts of Hungary (including such formerly major centers as Buda, Esztergom, Székesfehérvár, Pécs and Szeged) there was no institutionalized provision of music; all that may have existed is amateur music-making by the people living in the locality.
Music in School
The 16th-century Latin schools in Hungary pursued medieval traditions both in the material and methods of music teaching, and held on to liturgical melodies as pivotal for music theory and practice.
Archbishop Miklós Oláh, a prelate of impressive culture, issued in Nagyszombat school rules (1554, 1558) ordering the pupils of schools belonging to towns that were the seats of chapters to be on regular chorus duty according to the late medieval model provided by Esztergom and Buda.
However, as the Reformation gained momentum, the educational work of the Counter-Reformation religious orders, particularly the Jesuits, created a new situation when they began to teach choral music in schools.
Little is known, however, about how singing was taught in the Protestant schools in Hungary, but the scant evidence that has come down suggests that there were several choir practices a day.
The rare incidence of documents with notes, the complete lack of printed scores, and the low standard of musical notation (cursive Gregorian and mensural scores), however, provide indirect proof that the study of music notation was for a long time neglected in the schools of the Reformed Church and Protestant churches in general.
In these schools single-voice singing prevailed, and instruments and polyphonic singing were discouraged. The records that have come down - as, for instance, the preface to the Old Gradual (1636), a choir-book printed in the principality of Transylvania - present a rather depressing picture even of the limited practice of single-voice choral work.
The school rules of Johannes Honterus (Grass) of Brassó (1543) and Mátyás Raksányi of Körmöcbánya (1649) suggest the singing-teaching schedule in the municipal Lutheran schools in Transylvania and Upper Hungary.
It seems that besides the teaching and rehearsals of the songs and polyphonic pieces prescribed for the Sunday and holiday services, attention was given to score reading, the interpretation of music, and the mastery of various genres of verse.
Probably these institutions, where the language of teaching was not Hungarian, were in charge of the earliest transmission - with educational intent - of the Protestant-humanist song-poetry of the German language area.
The eastern boundary of the spread of metric songs was marked by Brassó, where Honterus published in 1548 his collection of school songs entitled Odae cum harmoniis, which contained 32 Latin song texts (fewer than 18 verse forms) and 21 four-part melodic versions.
The unknown editor drew the material partly from a work by Petrus Tritonius (Traybenraiff) (Melopoiae /.../ super XXII genera carminum, Augsburg 1507).
The publication had little effect, however, on Hungarian singing in Transylvania and beyond.
No records exist on genuine instances of the singing in Hungarian of metric school songs in several voice parts.
The few Hungarian metric odes in the Eperjes Gradual (1635-1652) reveal only the barest traces of the actual stylistic ambitions displayed at singing lessons in school.
The surviving fragments of metric songs came from the non-Hungarian culture complex within contemporaneous Hungary - as did, for instance, the collection by Georgius Tranoscius (Juraj Tranovsk) of odes called Odarum Sacrarum sive Hymnorum... Libri Tres, Brieg 1629.
The Latin songbook of metric verse used in Debrecen schools, of Imre Szilvás-Ujfalvy (Anderkó) (1596-1599), contained the Latin words without the melodies.
Here, the place of the ancient Pagan texts of the odes published earlier was taken by the metric psalms of the Scottish George Buchanan with the music by Statius Olhovius (Olthof) and the Latin translations of the religious songs originally written by German song writers, including Martin Luther.
Many of these songs were later republished in Lutheran songbooks for school use, in Bártfa (1640) and Lõcse (1642).
Another humanistic version in metric verse of the Psalm Book, the Psalter of Geneva edited in French, had exerted a tremendous influence in Hungary on singing in Protestant schools and congregations and on writing verse for songs (particularly, Andreas Spethe's Latin version, Heidelberg 1596; and the Hungarian translation by Albert Szenci-Molnár: Psalterium Ungaricum, Herborn 1607).
The books from which music theory was taught in school had usually passed into the ownership of the school concerned from some university or printing shop abroad.
The Magyar Encyclopaedia (Utrecht 1653) by János Apáczai-Csere was the first work to give Hungarian names and definitions for the fundamental concepts of music.
There was thorough and methodical music and singing teaching in the schools at Nagyszombat, Kolozsvár, Pozsony, Gyõr and Sárospatak of the Jesuits, who settled in Hungary in 1561 and became particularly active at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries.
Their aim was to replace the Gregorian choir that included every pupil, with a high-standard church choir and orchestra for the provision of polyphonic music on important religious holidays.
Instrumental music was also taught in a solid framework in the Lutheran schools. The Körmöcbánya Gymnasium, for instance, employed the organist Johann Kusser for this purpose. On the other hand, Comenius, teaching at the Calvinist (Reformed) college of Sárospatak, was not able to translate his ideas about making instrumental music flourish in Hungary into everyday orchestra practice.
János Kájoni, the Franciscan monk from County Csík, however, left valuable notes on his educational work, and two manuscripts (Organo-Missale 1667, and Sacri Contentus 1669), each used for practical lessons in score reading and transcribing scores into organ tablature. These were valuable works for teaching organ accompaniment, and consequently supply remarkable data on the local training of organist cantors of the time.
Although no score inserts have been left from the 16th and 17th centuries, it is known that play acting, an accepted practice at the time in Reformed and Jesuit schools alike, relied strongly on singing and music.
Palatine Miklós Esterházy and Count Ferenc Nádasdy lent on several occasions their own court musicians for the school-drama performances put on by the Jesuits of Sopron.
The scripts usually called for background music (e.g., the St. Nicholas minstrelsy of the Jesuits of Trencsény in 1688), or an insert of singing (István Eszéki's play in 1667), and sometimes determined the instrumentation of the musical interludes.
The printed version (Bártfa 1652) of a German Twelfth Night play produced at Eperjes in 1651, even prescribed which motets were to be performed (works by Samuel Scheidt, Andreas Hammerschmidt, and Johann Schimbracky) with a contemporaneous notation in the text referring to the scores recommended for source material.
The Jesuits of Pozsony presented in 1688 a school play about King St. Stephan with a major musical insert by Ferdinand Tobias Richter, the Viennese court organist.
Two tragicomedies, built - according to the evidence of the music notation to the scenes - on vocal performances throughout, are important mementos of early musicals staged in Hungary.
A scene from this work by an anonymous author found its way even into Catholic songbooks (Cantus Catholici 1675), and the melody has proven to be an enduring one.
It influenced György Felvinczy's drama by the same title (ca. 1690), though the immediate source of the latter is to be found in the mythological Cesti opera presented in the Viennese court (Il Pomo D'Oro, 1666).
Plain Folk Songs in Unison
While a new kind of Hungarian-language literature of songs was developing, the historical and cultural factors of the mid-16th century favoured folk music in unison.
The genre of verse-song chronicles sprang to life on the soil of epic tradition. The representation of present events and the recording of the occurrences of the near past together with an interest in old morality tales became incorporated in the genre, and at the same time Protestantism called to life several forms of religious songs in the mother tongue.
A secular section of the population, generally still of medieval Latin schooling but already absorbing the humanist culture of the Renaissance, promoted these new literary genres.
The author's consciousness was becoming a question achieving importance, while the "new songs" appeared in print still bearing numerous stylistic and formal features from the Middle Ages.
The verse-chronicles and related genres belong to the category of verse-song in which melody and words form an integral whole.
The second half of the 16th century marked the golden age of the verse-chronicle.
Some of the authors of the words - like Sebestyén Tinódi-Lantos and Mihály Sztárai - were at the same time the composers of the melody, bards and musicians in the same person.
The epics were basically verse chronicles or narrative songs.
Until 1560, they generally had religious or biblical themes, but later on struck a distinctly moralizing and preaching tone.
In the second half of the century, lays and romances based on mythological tales and fables, and generally of an entertaining character, began to appear fairly widely.
Sebestyén Tinódi-Lantos's Cronica (1554), the Hoffgreff songbook (Histories... from the Holy Bible ..., 1556), Gáspár Heltai's Cancionale with melodies drawn from Tinódy's verse-chronicles, and Parts II and III of Péter Bornemisza's songbook Énekek három rendbe (Songs in Three Orders, 1852) became the major printed sources of verse-chronicles.
Only the first three collections, those printed at Hoffgreff's in Kolozsvár, contain scores.
The melodies, spread by word of mouth in live performances probably accompanied by an instrument, reveal an exceptional richness of forms.
The poetry of the multistrophic verse and also the melodies themselves served the narration of the subject by way of song.
Though Tinódy's music shows domestic and foreign influence as well as an original style, his melodies produce a more or less homogenous effect.
Different from the late-medieval cancio of 16th-century Protestant song-verse, the independent preachers' style developed in direct interaction with the vocalized epics of the period and usually shared common melodic roots with the verse-chronicles.
Most of the words to the songs reflect subsequent application to an already existing melodic or verse form.
An understanding of the ad notam references that were linked with the entire 16th-century repertory of songs in unison, provides insight into the free treatment of melodies, different metric lines and metric verse, and into the development of word-of-mouth transmission.
Music During the Turkish Occupation of Hungary
Stylistic Variations in Turkish Music
Music in the period of the Turkish occupation of Hungary shows the coexistence of traditional Turkish music and the classical music of the Islam.
The former was introduced by the Turks as the tradition of shamans and minstrels, a world of folksongs.
The ordinary people knew this music, heard it and listened to it.
The classical music of Islam on the other hand was rooted in the culture of a Sassanid Persia, for which scholars writing Arabic - Al-Kindi, Al Farabi, Ibn Sina and Safi ad-Din - worked out a strict theoretical foundation in the 9th through 13th centuries.
The system of music that emerged in this way spread throughout the Muslim world from Magreb to India, and is flourishing to this day with only minor changes.
In the period under review, it provided entertainment only to a small intellectual elite of the Ottoman Empire.
Traditional Turkish music was itself divided into two classes: folk music and ashik poetry.
The first included folk songs and the dance music of the people, and the second covered the traditional written poetry of the Turks complemented with Muslim elements.
Professional and semi-professional bards (ashiks) cultivated it on the basis of stringent rules passed on from master to pupils over the long centuries.
Classic music bifurcated again according to the mode of performance: open-air (military) and chamber music.
The difference actually lay in the instrumentation and function of the works rather than in the place and genre of performance.
Military music (mehter music) aimed to cheer the troops or enhance the dignity of an occasion. Classic chamber music served as background music or was intended to promote meditation.
Folk Music
Although Turkish folk songs and folk dances are mentioned by a number of travel books, 16th and 17th-century Turkish folk music is actually known today only due to samples recorded in 1650 by a Polish renegade called Albert Bobowski - Ali Ufki in Turkish.
A folk-dance melody was written down by Salomon Schweigger in 1571.
It would be easy enough to extrapolate the folk music of a few hundred years earlier from what we know as such today, but the inference might be doubly wrong.
Such attempts are always arbitrary, moreover, the ethnic composition of the Turks providing the occupation forces is not sufficiently known.
What we know is that a lot of the troops were of South-Slav descent, most likely Bosnian.
Had they brought in the Slavic music of their ancestors, or was the Turkish-Muslim effect - which seems to be so clear today - already in evidence?
Because of the questions that remain open, once we talk about the "Turkish" folk music of the ottoman occupation, we must not ignore the South-Slav heritage either.
The Music of Ashik poetry
Turkish minstrelsy and ashik poetry flourished on the frontiers and within certain groups of the Alevi-Bekhtashi persuasion in the 16th and 17th centuries.
The verses were always recited in singing, to the accompaniment of an instrument.
The melodies were generally simple, suggesting only a few musical ideas.
Repetitions were characteristic, and recitatives common.
The aim was to render the words comprehensible and ensure that the melody satisfied this requirement.
At the same time, rhythm - whose continuity was maintained by the accompanying instrument - was not to get lost, at most it was allowed to become less marked.
Through Ali Ufki some two-hundred ashik melodies are known from the 17th century.
The fact that a good many of them are still sung indicates the resilience of ashik melodies and may even make us feel that the style of performance practised today may be projected back to the past with some validity.
Although the ashik poetry of the period of Turkish occupation is well known, there are today relatively few concrete signs of that heritage.
We know of only three verses - noted down together with the music - that are believed to have reached Hungarian ears. Two of them are works of Karadjaoghlan, and one is by Hassan Temeshvarli Gazi Ashik.
A manuscript that records some Bekhtashi verse from the period of Turkish occupation while it does not reveal any melodies, at least provides access to some key signatures (makams).
Several sources make indirect mention of the ashiks.
They sang about the bravery of heroes to the accompaniment of a kopuz, tanbur, sheshtar or chogur as the soldiers recalled the heroic deeds of the Oguzes.
The Hungarians living or fighting close to the frontiers captured a good many "Turkish Lyre players"; and Miklós Zrínyi, the famed poet of the times, also speaks in his great epic of "Turkish lyrists".
A local ashik by the name of Mihaloglu sang, "When the strings of the lyre are tuned, the beys are to high spirits groomed."
Military Music
In war, at parades and in battle the Turkish military musicians played at the foot of the flags, cheering the Muslim troops.
In times of peace they contributed to the magnificence of the sultan's court or the local military governor's household. The reception of envoys, parades, festivities and other pageantries were all occasions for music, and there was at a preassigned time every day an open-air promenade concert in some square, park or suitable tower. This public performance of instrumental music was called fasl.
The zurna - predecessor to our Turkish pipe - which played the melody, was their most important instrument.
The straight trumpet (boru, nefir) provided the accompaniment.
Percussions rounded out the ensemble with double-skinned drums (davul), small timpani (nackarais), and cymbals (zil).
Pairs of kettle-drums (koess) were slung over horse or camel-backs and then used only in the Sultan's orchestra.
Classic composers supplied the repertory.
The military music performed at the times in Turkish-occupied parts figures in a lot of sources: envoys and travellers speak about the deafening reception they got, and Turkish chroniclers write about the mechterhanae sometimes enough in itself to frighten away the enemy.
The pay-lists for mercenary soldiers and the accounts of timar defters give us information about the names of some of these army musicians.
It is easy to establish that just about every administrative centre of some significance had its own military band.
Ensembles consisting of six to eight members were not infrequent in the middle of the 16th century, though their number dropped to two or three by the 1590s.
It was hardly a case of the musicians melting away, but rather of being drained away into the personal households of the pashas and beys. This explains why the central lists and accounts made no corrections for their "disappearance".
Within an official district (vilayet) the mir-i alem (emir of the flag) was the chief officer, whereas the individual bands were headed by the mechterbashi or first piper, that is, the first zurna player.
Classical Music
Classical Osmanli music in the narrower sense was often performed like chamber music - though not only in enclosed spaces, but also at garden parties, during rest hours, and feasts.
These circumstances may have been deemed suitable because of the frequent association of this type of music with poetry, with special melodies created to go with special verses.
The composers came from widely distinct social strata, including rulers and chief officials as well as professional musicians.
It was, however, the mevlevi or dancing dervishes whose rites always included music, who determined the general features of classic Turkish music.
They often played for the Sultan, and gave lessons to young people in the seraglio school.
The palace people regarded the ud (lute), tanbur (long-necked lute), kahnun (plucked instrument resembling the zither), santur (cymbalo or dulcimer), chenk (harp) and the ney (flute) as the most distinguished instruments and considered them their own favorites.
Makam and usul are two fundamental concepts in Islamic music theory.
Makam defines the scale, the elaboration and embellishment, the harmonic procession and accented notes of the melody.
In addition, each makam carries its own tradition in regard to melodic structure and motifs.
Nearly five-hundred makams are on record. This is not so surprising in view of the fact that the koma, or one-ninth note, still forms the basis of Turkish music.
The usul is the name of the rhythmic pattern, which covers more than the European concept of rhythm.
Generally it stands for successions of heavy and light beats.
It is a formula that does not permit wide digressions: a firmly determined steady beat shapes the melody, which is somewhat freer.
The classic music of the Islam does not have voice parts or accords: each instrument plays in the same voice.
The szaz-szemai, pesrev and taksim were the most typical genres of instrumental music, and kar and murabba the pertinent types of vocal music.
It is difficult to demonstrate that classical music was present in the Turkish-conquered areas.
Now and then, of course, the originally Hungarian territories were visited by court orchestras playing serious music.
In 1526, after the Battle of Mohács, Suleiman celebrated the great Turkish victory with his own big orchestra in the Palace that once belonged to King Matthias of Hungary.
There is no reason to believe that Gazi Ghirei / Ghirei Gazi, Tartar khan of the Crimea, and one of the most significant composers of the period, was without his musicians when he spent the winter of 1596 in Pécs (South Hungary).
These occasions were, however, exceptional.
Still there are data to indicate an active music life at the time.
Evlia Chelebi, the renowned Turkish traveller of the times, wrote that the musicians of the Mevlev Monastery at Pécs were famous.
Even the rituals the Order observed show that its monastery must have been an important music center and school.
Works of music theory were fairly widely read in Buda.
The legacy of Ali Chelebi of Buda contained an Edvar of Risale; and Marsigli saved a number of books on music from destruction.
Although we have no information about works of music that have been definitely connected with the Turkish occupation of Hungary, the Codex Palatics offers some choice morsels to delight any music-lover's heart. It contains almost fifty murabbas classified according to makam.
Some of the verses show even a singing pattern for the rhythm: "Ten-ni ten-ni ten-nen-ni te-ne-ne".
Moreover, some of them written in Persian, these pieces - clearly to be sung - were linked to the Persian heritage, the most distinguished tradition in the realm.
These are memorabilia that testify to the existence of classic music at the time and are thus indicative of a high measure of culture under Turkish occupation.
It must have taken not only good musicians, but also appreciative ears and munificent patrons of the arts.
Several classical instruments are known to have been in use during the Turkish occupation period.
In 1543 in the court of Queen Isabel Pál Bakity must have seen Gypsies playing the santur when he commented that "they didn't use their fingers to pluck the strings, but beat them with a wooden stick".
The hussars of György Zrinyi captured two Turkish musicians in 1596.
According to Zrinyi, one of them had a cymbal of the kind students use to sing at Mass, but the Turk did not beat it with a wooden stick as a harp, but tugged and yanked it with his fingers. The man must have been playing the khanun.
The other one intoned a peculiar, never-before-seen two-string violin - probably a keman - like the string instrument of "oven-eye" shape Stephan Gerlach described.
In the early 1650s two Turkish lute or ud players lived in the household of Ádám Batthány: Mahmud and Mustafa.
The Turkish lyrist and lute player taken into captivity by Gáspár Franscsity in 1649 must also have been ud players / must also have been an ud player.
HISTORY OF DANCE
Tempus plangendi, tempus saltandi
(It's time to mourn, it's time to dance)
Power struggles, religious wars, and peasant revolts followed one another in the Europe of the l6-17th centuries.
The people, however, did not seem to notice the losses but danced with growing ardour.
Nevertheless this image may well be misleading because it is fed by a plethora of anti-dance sermons of the partisans of the Reformed Church and of the writings directly or indirectly connected with them.
Still one has the feeling that there had perhaps never been a period in European history when dance was a public matter of such importance as in the Renaissance.
Indeed the growing expansion of humanism, of Renaissance culture, of the Reformation and the concomitant cultural and social changes had a considerable impact on dance.
A framework of dance culture still valid in our days, the outlines of its structure gradually developed in the wake of the changes.
This opened the door to an unprecedented unifying effect of comprehensive dance fashions and to the prevalence of local colours.
Within the successive interplay of unification and differentiation all European nations took part in shaping fashion according to their abilities.
The "great powers of dance" were still Italy and France, yet the dances of other European peoples also had a say in shaping the new trends.
The performance of the well-known dances (used as a common language) in different manners (the Italian, French, Spanish, English, German, Polish or Hungarian way) became a fashion.
In addition to the widely diffused common dance language minor regional fashions started to make their appearance while the outstanding dances of the given region were also included.
The Carpathian Basin is a good example.
Dance masters, dance books, dances
Endeavours to achieve professionalism and beauty characteristic of the Renaissance, a longing for the deepest possible understanding of the sensual world and to extend human potentials to the extreme were typical features of the dance masters, dancers and the elite layer of dance culture.
The most famous dance masters, i.e. writers on dance in those days were Fabrizio Caroso of Parma (1525-1606), Cesare Negri of Milan (1530-1605) and the French Thoinot Arbeau (1519-1596).
Caroso who was spoken of as "the Leonardo of dance", developed a uniform table of rules, and stock of motives - almost simultaneously with Negri - by relying on Italian folk dances, on the experiences of dancers and dance masters.
This was no longer an occasional collection of selected folk dance movements but a system of steps and series of variations permitting the creation of any kind of dance composition (ballo).
The variations of jumps, turns and steps composed according to the principles underlying the technique of variations used in those days are still used in classical ballet.
The dance compositions arranged with vera matematica (with compasses and sand-clock) meticulously described from step to step were published in Caroso's Il ballarino, the first printed dance book that ran into several editions in Europe.
Thoinot's Orchésographie is a peculiar collection of dances.
The author - canon of Langres and master of ceremonies - collected the fashionable dances and dance compositions of his day without, however, omitting the outdated dances (e.g. basses danses) and other "evergreen" dances not mentioned in other books (such as the branle).
The meticulous description and illustrations in drawing of such dances as the pavane, gaillarde, courante, allemande, gavotte, moresca, canarie, volta, the Spanish gavotte and other dances are still the most popular sources for the fans of Renaissance dances.
The activities of Caroso, Negri and Arbeau can be looked upon as theoretical and practical preparations for the foundation of the French Académie de la Danse in 1661, an event of great significance in the history of European dance culture.
We are not aware of any other great masters carrying an equal impact in other European countries including Hungary.
The role of dance in the changing world
The earlier distinction made between sacred and profane dances had gradually been blurred by the time of the Renaissance.
Under the impact of prohibitions over centuries, dance - with a few exceptions - disappeared from liturgy ceding to music, poetry, drama, and fine arts of religious inspiration.
On the other hand a generally accepted wordly form of dancing had developed where the merry-making, entertaining function of dance ensuring social coexistence had become predominant.
This is why the bourgeoisie, growing in number and power, took a fancy to dancing.
Dance had become the means of refined social communication, of the expression of ideal body movement, in addition to combatant sports (fencing, horse-riding).
The nobility, mainly the well-to-do high nobility, supported the development of dance into an in dependent art, the prevalence of its specific aesthetic function and were ready to spending on employing professional dancers, on organizing dance performances, and on building theatres.
For the peasantry dance remained a mode of expression closely linked with music, playing, poetry, drama used according to the laws of tradition.
The nobility and the bourgeoisie had a special dual relations to the peasant dance traditions.
The more natural, playful and stronger forms of the peasant dances acted as ever renewing sources yet also as symbols of brutality, of ill-breeding, and of bad manners as opposed to the ideals of refined behaviour.
This is borne out by the grotesque, comic and often offensive illustrations of peasant weddings and other social occasions for dancing from the late Middle Ages to the Baroque Age.
Dance and the churches
In the 16-17th centuries the Churches assumed different attitudes to changing and promoting the role of dance.
The Catholic Church seems to have been more lenient.
Referring to the Scripture the clergy themselves practised dancing.
A good example is the Council of Trent where the dignitaries of the Church danced portly basses dances together with their lay brethren.
The Order of Jesuits founded in the 16th century paid special attention to dancing, organising spectacular theatrical performances to achieve the objectives of the counter-reformation.
In 1622 they celebrated the canonisation of their founder in Lisboa with a big dance performance referred to as ballet ambulatoire.
In 1610, on the occasion of the canonisation of Carlo Borromeo, Milan 's saint, four carriages representing the Church, the town of Milan, Portugal, and the Holy See moved in the procession while dancing groups around them acted out scenes from Borromeo's life.
Unfortunately, no descriptions of similar detail of the Jesuits' schools drama in Hungary have come down to us but pompous spectacles supported by Péter Pázmány, archbishop of Esztergom, are known to have been arranged in the Jesuits' school at Nagyszombat (today Trnava) to where musicians and dance masters had also been invited from abroad.
Protestant churches all over Europe in full agreement and close alliance passionately scourged dancing.
Their preachers, mainly the Calvinists, denounced dancing in their sermons as "sons of thunderbolt".
Translated into foreign languages and printed, these sermons became part of international intellectual exchange of ideas as, for instance, the writings of the Hungarian István Szegedi Kiss and of János Debreceni K. published in German.
A quote from a Latin-language Tractatus of the latter published late in the 17th century goes as follows: "Since dance survives in the Hungarian nation and in others and is practised at parties and weddings (by men holding women and ill-famed girls tightly together), this is linked with many a crime.
They dangle their bodies and crouch and lean and rise and straighten up, stamping with their feet and making noises with their hands (clapping), unveiling their breasts, stroking them and embracing one another, then snuggling to one another, patting their bodies, whooping and howling with their mouths, turning round and round while nodding with their heads and holding them high haughtily hence the dance is duly called the devil's mill, satan's bagpipe...".
And in 1672 the preacher István Nánási Lovász scolded the faithful as follows: "David did not pluck the musical instruments to form according to which he could spin, incline, squat and stamp more fancifully than you".
Dance reflected in the Hungarian language and in poetry
The first test of contemporary poetry linked with dancing was the translation of the Bible into one's mother tongue including the difficulties of finding the equivalents of all the references to dance from the specific expressions.
It is worth quoting a passage from Gáspár Károli's first Hungarian translation of the entire Bible in 1590, to wit, the beautiful description of King David's dance around the Ark of the Covenant (Samuel, II.6.14-16): "When those carrying the Arc of the Lord had made six steps, he sacrificed an ox and a fat calf there.
David was dancing with all his might around the Crate of the Lord having donned a linen ephod.
David and Israel's entire house carried the Ark of the Lord singing and trumpeting.
It so happened that when the Ark of the Lord reached David's town, Mikal, Saul's daughter, looking out of the window and seeing King David jumping and dancing before the Lord, she came to loathe him in her heart..."
A beautiful passage of love poetry about dance is a verse written between 1596 and 1909 in the Codex of Jób Franchali.
Similar beautiful descriptions of dances can be found in the Book of Songs of Vásárhely, in the Mátrai Codex, in the Book of Songs of Komárom and in the poetry of the Hungarian poet Bálint Balassi (1594).
Heyduck dance
The Heyduck dances can be traced in different descriptions, in notes of melodies, illustrations from the end of the 15th century to the early 18th century.
The 300 or so Hungarian and foreign descriptions collected tell us that the dancing was performed along with brilliant handling of a weapon (sword, axe) as a solo interwoven with combative, fencing movements or as a male group dance or occasionally in pairs performed with a woman.
Contemporary sources stress the violent, stamping character of the dance with almost acrobatic figures of jumping, crouching, lying on the ground, with characteristic movements of the arms and rhythmical shouts.
The dance was accompanied with the popular instruments of the period, such as the bagpipe, tárogató (oboe-like shawm) or drum.
The accompanying tunes were characterized by a rapid eighth-note rhythm and by the a melody of motives typical of the bagpipe.
It is interesting to note that the Heyduck dance became part and parcel of the peculiar tactics of the lightly armed East-European mercenary soldiers often resorting to machinations to surprise and to harass the enemy.
This is what we gather from the report of Gabelmann, a German eye-witness, about the 1595 siege of Esztergom: "One Heyduck and two Hungarian flag bearers jumped into the moat and danced the Heyduck dance under the heaviest firing of the Turks.
One would have thought one was attending a wedding rather than being in a war".
Contemporary sources clearly reveal how the war dance, a dance linked to occasions and rarely mentioned in medieval sources, gradually developed into a dance form encompassing the entire society of Hungary (including the serfs, the nobility, the warriors of the border forts, the ethnic groups), into a general dance style of the Carpathian Basin, the most characteristic feature of Hungary's dance culture in the eyes of Europe.
Following the Turkish sway and the struggles against the Habsburgs, the Heyduck dance lost its topicalness and slowly receded into the local pastoral-peasant traditions.
Its remnants can best be recognised in the shepherds' "instrumental" dances of the peoples of the Carpathian Basin. Having assumed different forms they became part of the new dance and music style of the 18-19th centuries referred to as verbunk, i.e. recruiting dances.
West-European dances in Hungarian social life
As we have seen, the fashion of the West-European couple dances reached Hungary pretty soon.
Documents from as early as the 14-15th centuries testify to their diffusion in the courts and among the urban bourgeoisie.
The growing number of documents in the 16th century indicates their wider diffusion and in the 17th century they appear to have been adopted by all social layers in addition to the Heyduck dance (a varied dance form representing the local dance culture of the age).
Dancing "the Hungarian way", as the sources put it, probably referred to the local style while the dances performed "the Italian way" or "the German way" meant the new fashion.
Two types of the characteristic couple dances of the European Renaissance came to be adopted in Hungary, the slow, walking, procession-like dances (basse danse, pavane) and the swift, turning, jumping, closely interlinked couple dances.
The slow couple dances appear earliest as an opening dance at high-class weddings, in fact as a ceremonial dance.
The hero of a German-language picaresque novel from the 17th century, known as A Magyar Simplicissimus, gives the following description: "When it comes to putting the bride to bed, a peculiar dance is started.
The best man takes hold of the bride and attaches a sabre to her waist, then two young lads, likewise girded with sabres, torches in hand, dance in front of her, while the bridesmaids and other friends in her escort line up in a row behind her.
The bride takes farewell of her parents, usually in tears, as well as of her closest relatives, then dancing throughout they spin out of the room unnoticed and she is lead up to the best man.
Meanwhile the music and the dancing continue until the escort of the bride returns.
With the bride's headdress and wreath stuck on his bare sword the best man comes in leading a bridesmaid with his other hand.
The torch-bearers in front of him, the others behind him dance into the room.
A few more dances, and the dance comes to an end.
This is followed by different other things.
The next day the bride appears bedecked in the headdress of a wife."
In the Hungarian sources of the 17th (and 18th) centuries the slow, procession-like dances are often mentioned as Polish dances (Polish changing, changing, saltus polonici, polonica and likewise) but they also occur as playful turning dances.
Most of the dances with similar names are in 3/4 rhythm.
This can be attributed to the European diffusion of the Polish Renaissance dances which was promoted by the intensity of the Hungarian-Polish political economico-cultural relations in the 16-18th centuries.
In the days of the Renaissance the swift jumping-spinning couple dances are regularly coupled with the slow walking dances (basse danse and tourdion, pavane and gaillarde).
The writings of Protestant and to a lesser degree Catholic preachers, the bans issued by town councils and county statutes are the most frequent sources proving their diffusion in Hungary.
In documents of music history they first appear under their own names (gaillarde, volta, courante) but later the same types recur under Hungarian names (hamar tánc, pajkos tánc) which may be indicative of their gradual assimilation.
The appearance of the West-European dance compositions (ballos, ballettos) and of the spectacular dance plays can also be found in Hungary's social life of the 16-17th centuries, mainly in the courts of magnates handing down the court traditions of the Renaissance (the Esterházy, Nádasdi, Batthyány, Báthory families) who often engaged West-European dance masters to plan their spectacular celebrations.
Some of them are known by name.
Don Diego de Estrada, Spanish master of ceremonies, employed in the court of Transylvanian ruling prince Gábor Bethlen at Gyulafehérvár (today Alba Iulia) in 1628-1629, had come from Padova to organize dance events, and performances.
In his Mémoirs he recalls teaching dances called gallarda, pavana, tardion, canario, barrera, games with lances, and Italian ballellos.
On 8 March 1628 he arranged a 30-strong ballet with the participation of Mars (consort of the ruling prince) and of Mercury (son of the first pastor of Kassa, Péter Alvinczi).
"The ballet would have been famous even in the court of the emperor", - writes Gábor Bethlen in his letter to Péter Alvinczi.
A famous dancer called Balaram Baptista is known to have been engaged in 1591 by Zsigmond Báthory, prince of Transylvania, and to have been entrusted with tasks similar to his above-mentioned Spanish colleague.
Eastern dances in Hungary
During the Turkish sway Hungary came into direct contact with eastern dance culture, its professional and traditional forms, which were very different from the western dances.
This can be gathered from the few sources referring to Turkish musicians and dancers having fallen into Hungarian captivity.
György Zrinyi, for instance, writes to Ferenc Batthyány about a Turkish musician kept in captivity: "Rézmán danced with the roguish Turk a miraculous dance of beautiful form, nothing, I know, can be more delightful....than watching it".
On the other hand, the dance illustrations of the contemporary Turkish miniatures lead to the conclusion that dance was a very popular form of entertainment in the Sultan's court and in magnates' households from which they did not refrain even in times of war, while staying in foreign lands.
The impact of Turkish culture of the 16-17th centuries on Hungary has successfully been studied in various areas (e.g. folk costumes, gastronomy) yet in dance research not even the question has so far been raised.
CHURCH HISTORY

The Reformation in Europe
The Catholic Church before the Reformation
The turn of the 15th and 16th century is one of the most contradictory periods in the history of Europe.
Besides the Renaissance which shocked the world view of the middle ages, the geographical discoveries that gave new dimensions to the stereoscopic boundaries, or the Ottoman advance that was threatening the continent - the most important changes were the growing interest in religion.
According to modern historiography the causes for the Reformation were due to neither the decline of the Catholic Church nor to the "anti-feudal struggle latent in religion" but rather to the new religious needs that appeared in the 15th century as well as in the demand to reform the Church structures of the middle ages.
The first significant Church reforms took place in Italy and Spain, where the prelates who lived exemplary lives and the committed seculars stood up against the ignorance and sinfulness of the church.
Hence to characterise the 16th and 17th centuries merely in terms of the counter Reformation would be misleading, since the Catholic reform striving towards internal revival appeared prior to the Reformation.
These revival movements usually started off from the bottom up and their most important manifestations were the reforms of the old monastic orders, the foundation of laic religious groups which inspired the birth of new types of monastic orders (to begin with the Jesuit order) and the proliferation of Biblical based and personal toned religious literature that satisfied the new demands being made upon religion.
From among the movements whose aim was to revive the Catholic Church, only the Reformation established an overall programme of reform, which was worded by the Council of Trento (hereinafter referred to as: Trident) (1545-1563).
First of all the council clarified the teaching of the Catholic Church in regard to all the questions being raised by the reformers.
However, the strengthening of church discipline and the stipulating of ministerial service as the priority of the clergy were considered to be even more important.
Bishops became the executives of reform, and were made personally responsible for the execution of reform resolutions immediately after the formation of the council.
This process took place at a very different pace and with various degrees of effect in different countries.
The Lutheran Reformation and the establishment of the Evangelical Church
At the beginning of the 16th century the need for the Church's revival was formulated in Church institutions and universities in several different parts of Europe.
One part of this general reform movement was the appearance of Martin Luther (1483-1546) lecturer at Wittenberg university, who did not intend to cause a schism by his 95 doctrines but rather wished to contribute towards the revival of the Catholic Church in the spirit of the era's reformist endeavours.
Luther spoke out against the practise of selling indulgences for money, and attacked the theological background of the Church.
As a result of Pope Leo 10th (1513-1521) and Luther's determination as well as the groundswell of support by German society (primarily the princes), the reform process that had begun within the Catholic Church split between the followers of the Church and those of Luther.
Therefore Luther's appearance must be interpreted as a purely religious matter, while at the same time the schism that he caused can be traced back to mainly political reasons (the disunity of the German Empire and its traditionally bad relationship with Rome).
The essence of Luther's doctrine is that we can only reach salvation by the mercy of God (sola gratia) and exclusively through faith (sola fide).
The only source he recognised for his doctrine was the Bible, and he refused to recognise that Church tradition was as equally important as the Scriptures (sola Scriptura).
He only kept two sanctities out of seven (Christening, and the Lord's Supper) and rejected the monasteries, as well as the obligation to respect mass and the saints.
The simultaneous struggle against the Catholic Church and the increasingly more radical people's Reformation (Anabaptists) made it necessary for the Lutheran Reformation to transform into a Church.
The fundamental creed of the Lutheran followers was worded by Philip Melanchton (1497-1560), and accepted by the Imperial Diet of Augsburg in 1530 (the Augustan Confession from the Latin name of Augsburg; this is where the old official name of the Lutheran Church originates from: Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession).
In the Holy Roman Empire the Evangelical Church became emancipated from the Catholic Church in 1555 in accordance with the Augsburg Peace in Religion.
The Helvetian orientated Reformation and the establishment of the Reformed Church
Luther's doctrine was further developed by others, one of which was the Swiss Ulrich Zwingli (1484-1531) a parish priest in Zurich.
From 1519, by following in the footsteps of the German reformer, he had formulated his theology, which contradicted Luther's doctrine on several points.
Primarily he did not recognise the holiness of baptism and the Lord's Supper, and rejected the belief in the physical presence of Christ at the Lord's supper.
Even the reconciliation negotiations (1529, Marburg Colloquium) were unable to resolve the differences between the two reformers which eventually led to the sundering of the Reformation.
He also put the fundamental principles of his theological doctrine into practice, and in co-operation with the town council he reformed the Church of Zurich (the abolition of celibacy and fasting, reforming the church service, sermons in German, undecorated churches).
His work was completed by his successor Heinrich Bulinger (1504-1575) whose doctrine was greatly influential in the whole of Europe including Hungary.
The doctrines of (German and Swiss) reformers further developing the Lutheran theories were compiled into a congruous system by John Calvin, who was of French origin.
The work of Calvin who had significant theological and humanist qualifications, can be mainly traced to the town of Geneva (1536-1538, 1541-1564).
He went beyond the doctrines of his predecessors as regards the comprehension of God's mercy.
According to this God predetermines people's fate to eternal damnation or eternal bliss (predestination, or praedestinatio in Latin).
On the question of the Lord's Supper, he took an intermediate standpoint between Luther and Zwingli: according to him the Lord's Supper is an intermediary of Christian mercy.
Similarly to Zwingli, Calvin also placed a very strong emphasis on the practical execution of the Reformation: under his plenipotentiary guidance Geneva became the centre of the Helvetian Reformation.
The essence of the Church constitution he introduced is that parishes should be led by the presbytery consisting of Pastors and secular believers.
By his moral doctrine which encouraged people to work and to save as well as permitted a righteous collection of interest he gave a push to the formation of capitalism; his Church administration system contributed towards the development of political democracy.
The continuation of his work by the Genevan reformer is connected to the name of his successor Theodor de Beze (1519-1605).
The spread of the Reformation in Hungary (16th century)
The Catholic Church at the beginning of the 16th century.
The state of the Hungarian Catholic Church in the 15th century was in line with the European tendency at the time: the prelacy primarily carried out office and political activities, the poor and uneducated lower clergy could barely complete their tasks, and the monastic orders (due to the so called commendatory-system) were in a serious crisis.
Church reform appeared in a very watered down version: it consisted of a few weak attempts by the prelacy to renew the monastic orders (more or less successfully) and the preaching of Franciscan writers urging reform - all praiseworthy but insignificant efforts.
At the same time under the supervision of the clergy and religious attitude of the believers it had undergone significant changes: the various religious associations (confratenitens), the flourishing of pilgrimages, foundations making donations for churches and the growth of codex literature all prove that people were indeed interested in their faith, and that the turn of the 15th and 16th century was the golden age of religious literacy in Hungary.
The Lutheran Reformation in Hungary
New ideas soon appeared in this intense and sensitive religious atmosphere.
According to the historical traditions of the Protestant Church 1521 saw the appearance of the Reformation in Hungary: where several teachers of the college of Buda had already been teaching in the spirit of Luther's doctrine.
From 1522 more and more young Hungarian students pursued their studies at the university of Wittenberg which was considered to be the centre of new education.
Before Mohács, the new doctrines found their followers in the capital, and from among the German citizenry and the German courtiers of the royal court, and even the wife of Louis II. - Queen (consort) Mary sympathised with them.
In the 1520's even the citizenry of the towns of Upper Hungary and Transylvania became acquainted with the Lutheran doctrines and joined it in large numbers.
The main enemies of the new belief were the prelates and the lesser nobility: the prelates regarded the rapid spread of new ideas as heresy while the nobility regarded it as "German practise".
This resistance was worded by article 4. of the Parliamentary session in 1525, which committed Luther's followers to burn at the stake (in the spirit of the anti heresy laws of the Middle Ages).
Despite the fact that according to the aforementioned article executions indeed took place, mass persecution was not carried out (mainly as a result of the weakness of the central powers and the Catholic Church).
The spread of the Reformation was significantly helped along by the battle of Mohács, the chaotic political situation arising from the Turkish onslaught and the decline of Church structures.
The Lutheran doctrines gained lasting success among the Saxons of Transylvania and Szepes.
The Reformation of the Transylvanian Saxons is linked to the name of Johannes Honterus (1498-1549) Pastor of Brasso, while that pertaining to those of Upper Hungary can be tied to Leonhard Stöckel (1510-1560) the rector of Bártfa.
It was Stöckel who edited the first Lutheran spirited and highly significant document of the Hungarian Reformation which was used by the five free royal towns of Upper Hungary as a protection against King Ferdinand the 1st 's charges of heresy. (Confessio Pantaploitana, 1564.)
The first period of the Hungarian Reformation lasted until about 1540, which is deservedly called the period of sanctuary.
Students returning from the university of Wittenberg and Catholic priests (mainly Franciscans) who had accepted the new doctrines were preaching Luther's doctrines in the towns of Hungary and Germany as Pastors or travelling preachers.
The most important representatives of the first generation were Mátyás Bíró Dévai (around 1500-1545) who was given the name of the "Hungarian Luther" by historiography, Imre Ozorai author of the first Hungarian language Lutheran book and András Gálszécsi (? - around 1543).
The fact that the Reformation had also reached the Hungarian villages and agricultural towns was the result of the tireless literary and missionary work of the preachers.
The names of András Horvát Szkhárosi poet and the preacher of Tállya, Mihály Sztárai (? - 1575) the reformer of the occupied areas and Gál Huszár (? - 1575) printer and preacher who visited half of the country - must definitely be mentioned.
It is important to emphasise that the Lutheran doctrines effected Hungary through the interpretation of the reformer Philip Melanchton who had a strong influence on the Hungarian students of Wittenberg.
In the first period of the Reformation the doctrine did not have the result of forming a creed since the believers were relatively free to choose from the elements of theological doctrines and from Church events.
This kind of eclectic religion was characteristic of the reform supporting aristocrats as well as communities of agricultural towns or village parish priests.
Land owners who stood by the Reformation (Elek Thurzó, Ferenc Révay, Péter Perényi, Tamás Nádasdy, Péter Petrovics) insisted on preserving several elements of Catholic religious practise.
Although land owners played an important role in the rapid spread of the Reformation, villages and agricultural towns under their power still chose from the different tendencies independently from them.
The religious affiliation of the communities often depended on the clergyman they could take into service and the doctrine he represented.
The Helvetian orientated Reformation in Hungary
In the history of the Hungarian Reformation, the influence of Zurich and Geneva - the two significant centres of the Helvetian Reformation can be seen from the beginning of the 1550's.
Márton Kálmáncsehi Sánta (? - 1557) was the first reformator following Zwingli. Being a canon in Gyulafehérvár, he later became a preacher.
Kálmáncsehi not only followed the Swiss Zwingli's ideas about the Lord's Supper but by complying with his practical programme he removed the alters, pictures and ornaments from churches of the territory East of the river Tisza.
This got him into trouble with not only the Catholics but with the followers of the Lutheran Reformation too. Finally his death prevented him from establishing a Church organisation based on his own doctrines.
In the following decade the work started by Kálmáncsehi was continued by preachers who joined the Helvetian tendency in growing numbers.
The Swiss Reformation - the representatives of which were called sacramental ("simoniac") due to the views they held regarding the Lord's Supper, - were not only wide-spread among the nobility but among the citizenry of agricultural towns, the military of the border areas and the peasantry.
As a result of the educational and organisational work carried out by the highly knowledgeable István Kis Szegedi (1505-1572) and Péter Juhász Mélius (1536-1572), by the second half of the century the independent Reformed Church organisation was established.
Attacks by the Catholics and Lutheran followers as well as the arrival of a new trend from Transylvania - the deniers of the Holy Trinity (anti-Trinitarians) necessitated the strengthening of the doctrine and the Church administration.
The separation of the German and Swiss trends had taken place by 1566-1567 in the Northeast and Eastern parts of Hungary and in Transylvania, the most significant event of which was the Debrecen Synod that accepted the 2nd Helvetian creed (1567).
This division only took place at the end of the 16th century in Northern and Western Hungary, as a result of the schism within the Evangelical Church.
Under the influence of Melanchton's doctrines, some of the preachers and nobles were inclined to symbolically interpret the Lord's Supper (kryptocalvinists, Secret Calvinists in English) and this group finally joined the Reformed Church following the religious dispute of Csepreg in 1591 - according to which the denomination which belonged to the same ecclesiastic organisation was divided.
Calvin's doctrine was not exclusive in its influence upon the theology of the Hungarian Reformed Church as the second generation of the Swiss Reformation - Bullinger and Beze - played an equally important role.
As a result of the peculiar societal development in Hungary, several points of Calvin's doctrines came into realisation in a rather altered way.
First of all presbyteries which were the basis of the Calvin Church constitution only appeared from the 17th century, up to that point the direct supervision of congregations came under the minister's sphere of authority.
Similarly to this, Calvin's doctrine allowing the collection of interest could not be enforced either.
However, the doctrine regarding armed resistance against a tyrannical monarch prolifically effected the ideology of the Hungarian aristocracy during the times of the anti-Habsburg rebellions.
The anti-Trinitarians
The most radical branch of the Hungarian Reformation which nevertheless became a firmly established Church was the Holy Trinity denying (anti-Trinitarian) trend.
Anti-Trinitarian ideas first appeared in Italy and Poland. Anti- Trinitarians did not accept the divine nature of Jesus, therefore denied the Holy Trinity.
Their most important representatives were Mihály Szervét (1511-1553) a Spanish doctor and theologian who was sent to the stake by Calvin in Geneva, and Fausto Sozzini who represented a more moderate trend.
The appearance of the anti-Trinitarian doctrines in Transylvania is associated with the name of György Blandrata (1515-1588) who was the doctor of Zsigmond János monarch at the Italian court.
It was due to him that the monarch and Ferenc Dávid (1510-1579) Reformed Bishop of Cluj (Kolozsvár) accepted the idea of rejecting the concept of the Holy Trinity.
The free practice of the Anti-Trinitarian religion in Transylvania was permitted by the 1568 Parliamentary session in Torda, and thus the number of permitted religions in the principality rose to four.
Under influence of David who had a reputation for being a brilliant orator and debater, the majority of the citizenry of Cluj joined the new doctrine. In the 1580's more than half of the Hungarian population of Transylvania shared the anti-Trinitarian views.
The establishment of a Church and setting out of doctrines by this moderate tendency against the radical movements rejecting the Holy Trinity (Sabbathians) took place at the end of the 16th century, primarily due to the work of bishops Demeter Hunyadi (? - 1592) and György Erdélyi (1551 - c. 1597).
It would be accurate to say that there was a Unitarian Church from the beginning of the 17th century.
Out of all the trends of Protestantism, the Anti-Trinitarians were the most active.
Their more radical representatives had appeared as early as the 1570s in occupied Temesköz and Baranya, choosing Pécs to be their most important residence.
Their parishes were suppressed by the Counter Reformation only after the expulsion of the Turks.
The expansion of the Anti-Trinitarians over to the East side of the river Tisza and their strengthening in Transylvania were prevented by the Reformed Church by numerous religious disputes and various polemicist works.
The Catholic Church in the 16th century
Throughout the 16th century the Catholic Church virtually lost its position in Hungary.
In the Battle of Mohács out of the 12 bishops of the country 6 lost their lives.
In the following decades both kings gave the bishops' seats (more importantly the income to be derived therefrom) to their supporters as a reward, many of whom had little interest in the religious side of their parishes.
They lived in Vienna and Pozsony, where they mainly performed political, diplomatic and according to the practice of the late middle ages, administrative tasks.
Because of abuse, popes were reluctant to strengthen the position of bishops appointed by monarchs on the basis of their right of patronage, as a result of which hardly any sufragan bishops were left in the country (3 in 1538 and 4 in 1574).
The king himself did not hurry to fill benefices left vacant in the Church since the income from these was one of the important financial resources to be used in the defence against the Turks.
By taking advantage of the chaotic situation land owners set upon the often undefended Church lands (belonging to bishoprics, chapters and monasteries) and this type of looting took place with no regard to any religious affiliation.
Monastic communities that were in a crisis situation to begin with were given the finishing stroke by the Turkish conquest and attacks upon their monasteries: only the Franciscans and the Paulits managed to preserve a few by the end of the 16th century while the rest of them ceased to exist in Hungary.
Despite the fact that the first generation of reformers were Franciscans, we have no knowledge about the transformation of entire monastic houses.
As a result of the Turkish threat, the Archbishopric of Esztergom had to move to the town of Nagyszombat which therefore became the starting point of the revival of Catholicism in Hungary.
The first significant representative of the Catholic revival and the Counter Reformation was Miklós Oláh (1553-1568) archbishop of Esztergom.
He was a humanist and had a very enthusiastic attitude towards the reforming of the Catholic Church: he entrusted people with Church visits to the parishes of the head diocese, then at the five diocesan councils that took place between 1560 and 1568 he enacted laws to deal with the recognised deficiencies.
He encouraged his bishops to enact similar reforming activities.
Other significant achievements of Oláh's in 1554 were the uniting of the town school and chapter school of Nagyszombat and the chapter of Esztergom that had moved there, and later the foundation of the diocesan seminar in 1558.
In 1561 he made the Jesuit order settle in its residence but due to financial difficulties and personal disagreements the Fathers had to leave the town in 1568.
Oláh's efforts for reform therefore ended in failure, nevertheless with his partners (Miklós Telekdi, András Monoszlai, György Draskovics) he laid significant foundations which came to fruition in the following century.
After a period of nearly two decades absence the Jesuits reappeared in Hungary in 1586.
Attempts made by István Báthory the Prince of Transylvania to strengthen the Catholic Church's position in Transylvania were also futile in the short run.
His exertions were severely limited by the Transylvanian regulations (i.e. the bishop of Transylvania could not enter the principality).
Báthory had also turned to the most effective representatives of the Catholic restoration: the Jesuits. He first made them settle in 1579 in Kolozsmonostor then in Kolozsvár two years later where they managed to produce significant results mainly through their schools.
During the chaotic decades that followed the prince's death they had to leave Transylvania on several occasions, and in 1603 the angry citizens of Kolozsvár even ravaged their monasteries.
In the same period several young monks joined the monastery (Péter Pázmány among others, latter Archbishop of Esztergom), who later became the leading characters of the Catholic revival in Hungary.
The development of the Catholic Church had a peculiar development in the occupied Hungary.
Bishops of the territories occupied by the Turks could not return to their residences but lived far from their congregations usually in Vienna, Nagyszombat or Pozsony.
The majority of the people therefore joined either the Lutheran or Calvinist Reformation.
The Catholic Church only survived in places where the relationship between the Franciscan monasteries and the local community was close, for example in Gyöngyös or Szeged.
In other areas (in the county of Baranya for instance) the secular Catholic preachers (called Licentiates from the beginning of the 17th century) maintained the Catholic faith of the villages.
Along with the large number of Croatian and Bosnian Catholic settlers and traders arriving from the South, Bosnian Franciscans also appeared mainly in the Southern part of Hungary and areas along the banks of the Danube.
The picture of denomination in Hungary at the end of the 16th century
The various tendencies of Protestantism had formed into a Church by the end of the 16th century and this resulted in a stabilised proportion among the denominations.
Almost half of the 3.5 million of the country's Christians belonged to the Reformed, and one quarter to the Evangelical Church.
The remaining quarter joined the congregations of the Unitarian, Orthodox and Catholic Churches.
Thus, 85-90 percent of the entire population of Hungary became Protestant.
Followers of the Reformed Church were mainly Hungarian aristocrats, citizenry of agricultural towns and soldiers, most of them living in the central and eastern part of the country.
The Evangelical Church was pushed to the border areas, and its congregation consisted of landowners, and the citizenry of German towns as well as the Slovak peasantry.
Except for Transylvania, Unitarians were only present in the occupied southern region of the country, however, in the principality they represented half of the population.
Catholics only formed significant groups in certain larger towns, on the estates of the few remaining Catholic landowners, and in Székely land (in Eastern Transylvania).
The number of Orthodox believers was increased by the Serb and Transylvan-Romanian immigration to the occupied territories.
Amongst Croatians the Reformation went almost unnoticed, the majority of them remaining Catholic.
The forming of the various Protestant denominations into a Church was also completed by the end of the 16th century.
The Evangelical and Reformed (in Transylvania also the Unitarian) arch deacons and church districts were formed, by superintendents at their fore.
Superintendents were not linked to each-other through an organisation, therefore a national Church did not come into being in the case of either denomination.
As part of the Hungarian feudalism the Catholic hierarchy also remained beside the Protestant Church system, and in the following century started a counter attack to regain the lost position of Catholicism.
Catholic revival and the counter Reformation (17th century)
The first wave of the Counter Reformation at the turn of the 16th century
The spread of Protestantism in Hungary could not be prevented by the monarch and the state power in the period beginning with the Battle of Mohács until the end of he 16th century.
Vague Parliamentary decrees aiming at such were not carried out.
The first more serious counter attack took place under the reign of Rudolf I, (following the Austrian and Czech examples) when a few Catholic prelates with military support began the seizure of Protestant churches and schools, and drove out Pastors and teachers.
This attempt was also supported by commanders of the mercenary army stationed in the Upper Hungarian region.
This kind of violent re-catholicisation was faced with a serious resistance by the Protestant aristocracy and the town citizenry.
The seizure of the Evangelical church of Kassa by the Catholics caused particular indignation among the public, alongside the new autocratically created article 22 that was added to the resolutions passed by the Parliamentary session of 1604 which forbade discussing religious matters within Parliament.
These steps (among others) were the direct causes of the anti-Habsburg rebellion initiated by István Bocskai in 1604.
State power and the catholic prelate soon faced the consequences of the sudden failure to revive Catholicism: they could not achieve any results by the violent methods they used in the Austrian provinces and against Protestantism which was supported by the strong Hungarian feudalism.
Therefore in the Viennese Peace Agreement in 1606 and the following Parliamentary session of 1608 which sanctioned this agreement the court and the holy orders made a compromise in religious matters, too.
In accordance with that the monarch ensured the free practice of religion for the aristocrats, nobles, border guard military soldiers, the free royal towns and royal agricultural towns.
Naturally this only concerned the Lutheran (Evangelical) and the Helvetian (Reformed) trends.
This religious freedom was strengthened and supplemented by the Habsburg - Transylvanian peace agreements of the following decades, and formed the basis of the legal relationship between the state and the Church right up until 1671.
Péter Pázmány and the Catholic revival
The events which took place after 1608 formed the most exciting turning point in the history of the Reformation and Counter Reformation.
This was the time from when the Catholic Church - the goal of which was revival - began to realise its aims - something it had failed to do by guns and violence.
The two leading personalities of the Catholic revival in Hungary were Ferenc Forgách (1607-1615) and Péter Pázmány (1616-1637) Archbishops of Esztergom.
Forgách (previously himself the believer of reviving of Catholicism by armed force), held a provincial council in 1611 in Nagyszombat which decided the execution of resolutions passed by the council of Trento.
Although in Hungary the council was only officially announced at the bishoprics of Zagreb and Gyõr, the planting of the most important Church discipline resolutions into practice began from the 1610's (synods, church visits, education of priests)
Jesuits also appeared in Hungary in the same years and by 1615 they already ran two colleges (in Nagyszombat and Homonna) in the country.
Jesuit institutions were regarded as important centres not only for their famous schools but for the evangelist work they carried out on the properties of the growing number of Catholic noblemen.
The work of Péter Pázmány who became the Archbishop of Esztergom from being a Jesuit, - was even more significant than that of his predecessors.
The secret of Pázmány's astonishing influence lies in the fact that he managed to utilise all means of the Church revival in a masterly manner.
In all the genres of religious literature he left something lasting (works on religious disputes, theological summaries, preaching, prayer books), paid attention to the education and upbringing of Catholic priests and helped in the foundation of Jesuit colleges.
Within this field his most significant achievement was the foundation of the university of Nagyszombat in 1635.
In addition he held syndics at county, provincial and national levels, and organised Church visits to the parishes of the Church districts.
Numerous aristocrats and nobles became Catholic under the influence of Pázmány and the Jesuits, but according to the right of presentation their conversion eventually resulted in the catholisation of the serfs who lived on their lands.
Although the statement his contemporaneous made is slightly exaggerated, they were right: Pázmány was born in a Protestant country, and died in a Catholic one.
Although Pázmány's colleagues and successors were not such outstanding characters as himself, by their pertinacious work they significantly contributed towards the success of the Catholic revival.
Besides the prelates - most of whom had been following Roman studies - the Jesuits were the main participants of this process.
By 1650 four Jesuit Colleges, eight residences and fourteen missionary stations were operating in the country with 149 Jesuits, and this had tripled by the beginning of the 18th century.
Other monastic orders (mainly Franciscans, Paulits and Piarists) also carried out significant ministerial, teaching and missionary work in Hungary.
By the middle of the century the majority of the prelate had completed a seminar and held the required basic qualifications.
Catholic religious literature had appeared, which was both in quantity and quality a worthy competitor of the literature of the Reformation.
Results of the Catholic revival in the Turkish occupied areas and in Transylvania appeared late and metastatically.
Jesuit evangelists began their work in 1612 among those Catholics who lived in areas under Turkish occupation, and they supplemented the work of Bosnian Franciscans and evangelists sent from Rome, although the co-operation between the different orders were not always free from disagreements.
Pázmány's synods had legalised the operation of licentiates who managed to keep their congregation in their Catholic faith right until the end of the occupation.
Within the Principality of Transylvania only the Franciscans of Székely land, secular priests and Jesuits under the threat of expulsion represented the Catholic Church.
The internal crisis of Protestant Churches and their revival movements
The Catholic revival represented by Pázmány and his followers significantly weakened the positions of Protestantism in Hungary (mainly by the conversion of the leading nobility).
At the same time the Protestant Churches themselves went through a crisis period during the 17th century.
Against the Evangelical and Reformed orthodoxy which became uncompromising throughout religious disputes and dogmatic debates, other waves of reform appeared.
The most significant of these within the Reformed Church was while within the Evangelical Church it was Pietism (the last of these only appeared in Hungary from the beginning of the 18th century).
Puritanism first appeared in England at the beginning of the 17th century.
Its representatives placed emphasis on individual piety and intimate belief and at the same time took up as their cause the establishment of a Presbyterian Church model.
They were students educated in England and Holland who introduced Puritanism into Hungary and Transylvania.
Their most important representatives were János Dali Tolnai (1606-1660) Pál Medgyessy (1605-?) and János Csere Apáczai (1625-1659)) who tried to encourage the internal revival of their Church by introducing school reforms and by the issuing of spiritual literature.
Their most powerful patron was Zsuzsanna Lorántffy (1600-1660): the wife of György Rákóczi I. Prince of Transylvania.
The movement had finally failed as a result of resistance by the representatives of Reformed orthodoxy, most importantly bishop István Katona Geleji (1625-1659) and the Prince, Puritanism nevertheless significantly influenced the later development of the Reformed Church council and religion in general.
The Church policy of the Princesses of Transylvania: Gábor Bethlen and György Rákóczi was to strengthen the Reformed Church, although Bethlen showed great patience towards Unitarian and Catholic denominations, too.
Throughout the reign of György Rákóczi I. but especially under his son György Rákóczi II. there was increased pressure put on these two denominations.
A decision made by the 1638 Parliamentary session in Dés made the most moderate tendency of anti-Trinitariasm compulsory and tightened up the state supervision over the Unitarian Church (dési complanatio).
From this point onwards the more radical movements were persecuted by the law (the Sabbathians primarily).
In 1953 Jesuits were forced to leave Transylvania temporarily.
As a result of the Church policy carried out by the Reformed Princes, Reformed religion became the state religion in Transylvania in the 17th century.
The second wave of the Counter Reformation
The Catholic success in the first half of the 17th century was undoubtedly due to the efforts made towards its internal revival, however, there is evidence that violent means were being employed at this time too, pointing towards a counter Reformation.
The Counter Reformation line began to increasingly gain ground from the 1660's not only as a result of growing political tension but also due to the impatience of Lipót I. emperor and Hungarian king, and the ever more powerful Habsburg absolutist tendencies.
Furthermore, because of the weakening of Protestant feudalism, the Hungarian prelate realised it was time for a more determined approach.
These events followed the well-known pattern of the previous decades prior to the Bocskai-revolt: i.e. the taking over of schools and churches, driving out of pastors and teachers and replacing them with Catholics instead.
In the period between 1671 and 1681 following the suppression of the Wesselényi conspiracy and mentioned as the "decade of grief", the religiously dissatisfied Hungarian feudal movement made an illegal attempt with the help of the Catholic prelate to completely destroy Protestantism.
In order to bring this plan into realisation, under the leadership of György Szelepchényi archbishop of Esztergom (1666-1685) some four hundred Protestant pastors and teachers were charged with political treachery, out of which - according to certain sources - 41 were condemned to the galleys (1675).
The 30 galley slave pastors who survived were ransomed by the Dutch admiral De Ruyter.
The second wave of violent counter Reformation proved clearly once again that such methods only encouraged Protestants to unite both locally and in national politics.
The resistance led to the Kuruts rebellion under the leadership of Imre Thököly which again forced the court to compromise.
The Parliamentary session in 1681 re-established the feudal rights of freedom and allowed the practice of Evangelical and Reformed religions at articular places.
The 16th and 17th centuries were the most complicated period in the history of Christianity.
The Hungarian Reformation had overtaken the development in Europe in all its forms, since the Anti-Trinitarians became an independent Church in Transylvania.
Another Hungarian peculiarity is that this variable religion was able to consolidate, none of the Protestant denominations gained absolute predominance over the others, and the different Church organisations were established simultaneously.
Besides, the Catholic Church also remained and the Catholic hierarchy had been continuously maintained, and at the beginning of the 17th century after an apparent death that lasted for several decades, it was fighting for the re-conversion of souls as an equal partner.
A national Protestant Church therefore did not come into being in Hungary (as opposed to other European countries such as England, the German Principalities, and Scandinavian countries) and at the same time the Catholic Church was neither able preserve its hegemony (as in Italy or Spain) nor to re-gain its positions (France, Poland and the Habsburg territories).
The other important lesson to be learned from the Hungarian development was that in the Church history of both decades the dialectics of Catholic reforms, the Reformation and the Counter Reformation are clearly visible.
In the first half of the 16th century the Reformation offered solutions to real demands which contained a message to all levels of society.
Therefore its success cannot only be related to either a single societal group (land owners for instance) nor to a type of colony (i.e. agricultural town).
The solution it offered for the religious demands made by society played as an important a role in its spectacular success as did the disintegration of Catholic Church structures and political anarchy.
At the same time Catholicism which was announcing an internal revival, in the following century managed to successfully fight against Protestant Churches that had lost their spirit.
However, in the historical era in which the Catholic Church chose to enforce its will in regard to the Counter Reformation through violent means together with the Habsburgs (the first and seventh decade of the 17th century), they failed when faced with Protestant resistance.
Lasting success could therefore only be achieved by both parties through the pursuit of a true revival and by converting people without force.
FOLK BELIEFS
Patronal Festivals
When in 1456 three months after János Hunyadi's death, one of the most popular Franciscan orators of the era and hero of the struggle against the Turks: János Kapisztrán died in Újlak, thousands went on a pilgrimage from all over the country to see him laid out in state and then later to his grave.
These pilgrims were people of all ranks: serfs, handicraftsmen, nobles.
They were led by a common aim: to be able to touch the clothes of the preacher who was regarded as a Saint in his lifetime; to walk around his grave and beg for his intervention on their knees, to be healed of their physical and spiritual pains.
These sick people including the paralysed, those with cataracts, epileptics, people with fever, and those possessed by the devil were all hoping for a miracle through the intervention of this wonder working priest.
This example truly exemplifies the spiritual mentality of man of this era.
According to their societal position they went on pilgrimages both at home and abroad: the wealthier citizens and nobles visited the Holy Land, Rome, Aachen, Köln and Mariacell to witness a miracle and returned home physically and spiritually purified.
Pilgrimages
As the Turks advanced the more adventurous pilgrimages abroad became more difficult to complete, so instead the domestic places of pilgrimage gained in popularity, especially since in Hungary all the major regions had their own shrines.
At the end of the 15th century, the number of letters addressed to the Pope in which people asked for permission to hold parish feasts and for relics, had increased.
By admiring relics they hoped for an effective protection from the increasing Turkish attacks, and looked for opportunities for penance.
On the one hand, pilgrimages abroad represent those roads through which Hungary joined the European mentality and on the other hand they paint a picture of what the cult of Hungarian Saints in Europe was like.
(Saint Erzsébet of the Árpád dynasty, Saint Margit, Saint István, Saint László).
Pilgrimages at home and abroad mainly took place by individual initiation, though little is known about the method.
We are familiar with the clothing worn by the pilgrims of the era and these were supplemented by a pilgrim stick and a pilgrim satchel.
The long journeys on foot cost an enormous amount of money.
Food could not be taken for these journeys which could last for days, weeks or sometimes even for years, it was always obtained on the spot.
Monastic orders and pious groups often helped the pilgrims on their journeys.
For instance throughout their journeys to Aachen they were offered bread, meat, fish, fruit, beer and wine.
The Hungarian group entered Aachen with a cross.
Pilgrims on their journeys were given accommodation in people's houses, alms-houses, stables and barns.
Pilgrimages of the Middle Ages were the types to ask for help, and the miracle cures took place at the holy places by walking around and touching the relics.
Under the influence of the Turkish occupation and the denominations, the Mary shrines were the most popular among the domestic places of pilgrimage.
Virgin Mary worship which was rooted in a great tradition took up a new aspect.
The Mary figure became an anti-Turk symbol through the influence of the Franciscan order.
An example for such is the devotional ornament in Csíksomlyó and the icon of the church in the lower town of Szeged which according to the legend was hidden from the Turks in a lake outside the church in 1552.
Some years later, a Turkish soldier found it while swimming his horse in the lake, and surprisingly he gave it back to the Franciscan monks.
The credit for the victory of the Catholic Székelys (inhabitants of Székely land in Transylvania) over the army of prince Zsigmond János who wanted to force the people of Csík to become Protestants - was attributed by the faithful to the intervention of the devotional ornament of Csíksomlyó.
Going on a pilgrimage was considered to be a special event in the life of a Christian.
However, church liturgy and superstition were both part of people's everyday life.
The sacraments of the Church extended into every aspect of people's lives.
They sanctified nature both in its living and lifeless forms, the steps of earthly life and the necessities of everyday life.
Consecrated water was one example of a tool used for purification and sanctification and which was present at both blessings and exorcisms.
Other sanctified items were the consecrated candle, consecrated fire, consecrated food and drinks which mediates health and protection to those have faith in them.
From as early as the 16th century, the blessing of new bread became another religious observation.
It became a wide-spread habit among believers to carry consecrated scripts, miniatures and coins to places of pilgrimage, in order to afford protection from danger.
Numerous scripts have survived from the 16th and 17th century which consist of superstitious rather than religious elements against illnesses and possession by the devil.
One such article is a small book on exorcism that has remained intact in the library of the Franciscan monastery in Gyöngyös, which contains various blessings for keeping away evil spirits.
Those who carried a scrap of paper were supposed to be safe from evil harm, but they were useful in other cases, too.
These pieces of paper with blessings written on them were buried in the four corners of the garden, vineyard or arable land in the hope that they would ward off any possible destruction to the crops by the elements.
The house and stable was protected in the same way.
The Church of the Middle Ages had faith healing and other sets of texts for warding off bad fortune and which regarded all matters and problems of human life and all the diseases of the body and spirit.
This was based on the belief people held at the time that disease is caused by harmful spirits which can attack people's health, bring them bad fortune and suffering, kill their animals and destroy their crops.
However, by calling on God and the Saints the evil spirits can be made to leave.
The basis of the faith healing prayers is faith in the magical power of the word.
Texts of the ancient pagan magic incantations to cure sickness took on Christian tones in the course of time.
Blessings plead for the effective presence of God, and exorcism also sought to drive out the devil through His help.
The first texts that were found date from the end of the 15th century and are most likely of Church origin.
Péter Bornemissza in his work entitled: Evil Spirits (1578) he includes eight faith healing prayers from Mrs. Benedek Tardoskeddi Szerencse, which she had learnt from "her grandmother and her priest".
These give an account of the flourishing practice of faith healing prayers to relieve rheumatism, headaches, sore throats, spells, worms, stomach ache...
Faith healing was not only present in the lives of serfs but was a typical manifestation and need for the whole of society.
This practice however was more or less suppressed by the common approach of Protestantism.
Nevertheless it was perpetuated by the Franciscans, the order which had the closest contact with the people.
(It is no accident that a synonym for Franciscan is "Friend" in Hungarian /brother in English/).
These brothers adapted themselves to serve the spiritual needs of the people and offered a healing solution for all their problems.
This could have been part of the reason why some of the Franciscan monasteries became symbols of peace and comfort (as well as places of pilgrimage), the warmth and glow of which could have far reaching effects in a country which had been dismembered by the Turks and had more than its fair share of religious disputes.
MUSLIM RELIGIOUS LIFE
Djamis, mosques and dervish orders in Hungary
The entire population of Hungary was 3,5 million out of which 900,000 lived in the occupied areas.
The religious life of the relatively small number - (50-80,000) of Ottoman-Turks was supervised by the mosques and djamis that were either newly built or transferred from Christian churches.
The djamis were larger churches which gave a home to the Friday service the Hutbe.
The most important person was the imam who carried out ceremonies through prayer before the congregation.
At larger places there was a separate Friday preacher the hatib, who performed the same task as the imam.
On weekdays an ordinary preacher the vaiz held the service.
There were several hafizes in each djamis, people who knew the Koran by heart either fully or partially.
The most well-known djami servant is the müezzin who called the true believers to prayer five times per day.
Payment for the servants of the mosque and the maintenance of the churches was the responsibility of the state or Church charities the vakufs.
Besides orthodox Islam, a large number of dervish communities also flourished. The most important ones were the bektasis, the halvetis and the mevlevis.
The Gül Baba monastery of Buda that belonged to the bektasi order and was close to the janissaries - was built by Jahjapasazáde Mehmed pasha the third begler bey (Turkish governor) of Buda throughout his reign (1543-1548) near the sepulchral chapel the türbe of Gül Baba.
While only 10-20 dervishes lived in other monasteries, the Gül Baba monastery provided shelter to 60 dervishes.
The most famous monastery of the halveti dervishes was built around 1576 next to the türbe of Sultan Suleiman I. (1520-1566) in Szigetvár.
This soon became the religious and cultural centre of the area.
The türbe and the monastery were looked after by some fifty soldiers.
The most famous prior of the zavije (monastic order, monastery) was the Bosnian Sejh Ali Dede, an outstanding cultural character of the 16th century, who lived in Szigetvár between 1589-1598) and wrote his famous work "Seals of Wisdom".
The monastery of Jakovali Hassan pasha of Pécs was at its best in the 17th century.
Its most outstanding prior was Pecsevi Árifi Ahmed Dede who was born in Pécs Hungary and pursued out his studies in the centre of mevlevian dervishes.
In 1686 he fled from the re-occupying troops to Filibe (Plovdiv) where he founded a new monastery and finally settled in Istanbul.
Here he worked as the prior of Jenikapi Mevlevohane, and besides his teaching activities he translated religious literature right until his death in 1724.
Muslim schools, Muslim culture
In the 17th century 165 elementary (mekteb) and 77 secondary and academic theological schools (medrese) were operating in the 39 occupied towns.
The mektebs taught writing, the four fundamental arithmetic functions, the reading of the Koran and the most important prayers.
Medreses carried out secondary and academic training within the fields of Muslim religious sciences, Church law and Sciences of Nature.
In Hungary, most medreses operated in Buda: seven in the Buda Castle and five in Víziváros.
In Pécs five medreses taught students, and in Eger and Eszék four medreses carried out such work respectively.
The most dignified medrese of the occupation was built in Buda by Sokollu Mustafa Pasha throughout his twelve years of governing (1566-1578).
The construction of this school was completed in the summer of 1575 where the mufti of Buda performed the teaching, and was at the same time the most significant religious superior of the occupying Muslims.
The most famous teacher of the medrese was Isza Efendi who was also the leader of the Turkish delegation at the peace negotiations in Gyarmat (1625) and in Szony (1627).
In 1634 he was made a kadi of Bursza and in 1637 a kadi of Istambul, and in 1639 he was appointed to the kadiasker of Rumelia, the most superior judge-advocate of the European provinces of the Turkish Empire.
Contrary to public opinion, the Ottoman rulers of the occupied areas were not uneducated barbarians.
In the Djamis people not only prayed, but were taught to read and write, to read the Koran and prayers.
The sermon of the Friday and festive services the hutbe was the most effective form of political education.
There were numerous elementary and secondary schools besides the mosques, and the monasteries of the Dervish order also served culture and education.
The spread of culture was supported by the mosque and school libraries.
In the school library of Sokolu Mustafa pasha in Buda, besides Muslim religious sciences other literature was also available for those were interested in oratory, poetry, astronomy, music, architecture or medical sciences.
Despite the continuous warfare, several cultural centres sprang up in this far corner of the Empire, where famous dervishes and scientists live for various periods of time.
The most educated ones had their own libraries like Ali Cselebi the finance administrator of Buda who died in 1587, and left 119 Arab, Persian and Turkish language books to posterity. Among these were religious, historical, political, astronomical and medical books as well as novels, poetry volumes a dream book, and even a work on chess.
LAND AND PEOPLE
GEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY
Extreme weather phenomena
The statistical data on climate for the 16th-17th century make it the so called mini ice age.
The yearly average temperature dropped by only one degree but nevertheless resulted in extreme weather phenomena.
From October to the end of February a thick layer of snow covered everything, cereal crops needed 3-4 extra weeks before they could be harvested, and to some degree the area of available arable land even decreased.
These phenomena - especially when considering the technical means of production of the time - made the conditions for agricultural production difficult.
The extremely cold winters followed by hot summers, very cold and wet nights and days of heat waves made people's lives difficult.
The greater part of the country's territory was covered by swamps and extensive wetlands.
People of the time complained often of vapours and dampness, noting for example that the shirts of soldiers sleeping in thick military tents were soaked by morning because of dampness in the air.
Deforestation
Just as in other forested areas of Europe, from the beginning of the 16th century there was an increasingly vigorous exploitation of forest lands in Hungary.
As a result of a boom in agriculture, the breeding of cattle in increasing numbers took up more and more grazing land, and the keeping of sheep and goats did not help to preserve the forests, either.
Besides the increasing demand for wood for everyday life, it was also needed for military use.
The building of palisade castles, fortifications and ships as well as gun-founding and the making of gunpowder required an enormous amount of wood.
Parliamentary decrees obliged more and more counties to transport wood from their forests to satisfy military demands.
King Ferdinand I introduced laws for the use of forests as early as 1557 but later the central government continued to devote its attention to the introduction of forest laws.
Forests were relentlessly devastated around the mines and foundries of Lower and Upper Hungary.
In order to sensibly utilise wood, the new forest patent issued in 1565 by the king ensured detailed regulations on sylviculture.
Waters and ploughs
The clearance and devastation of forests resulted in an increase in the land covered by water.
Rivers carrying silt blocked the river-beds and created small lakes and swamps, but the deliberate inundating and swamping of areas - which was a form of military defence at the time - also contributed to the expansion of areas under water.
One way of utilising nature was that in many places new castles were deliberately built in the mouth of the river or on grounds that were surrounded by water.
It was not uncommon in the 16-17th century that rivers were embanked by mill dams and these dams of different sizes also contributed towards the expansion of the water surface.
Today it seems almost unbelievable that residents of most areas of the lowlands of Hungary (The Alföld) used small boats for transport and tiny barges were tied to the end of their gardens.
Although the amount of forests in the lowlands of Hungary and around the border fortresses were decreasing, at other peripheral areas just the opposite process was taking place.
Uncultivated but arable land was firstly overgrown by scrub and then by dense forest.
The fact that arable land was pushed back was mainly due to the decrease in the cultivation of wheat, which was a common European phenomena in the 17th century.
POPULATION, ETHNIC MINORITIES
The reason for the decimation of the population
In the 16-17th century man's worst enemies were wars and epidemics and the starvation they resulted in.
Hungary was not the only part of Europe to undergo great suffering and to be witness to the devastation which accompanied the protracted wars.
Soldiers, whether Turkish, German or other nationalities all plundered the larders and barns of the population murdering those who offered any resistance and leaving the survivors to face the resulting starvation and epidemics.
The unhygienic natural environment as well as the people's attitudes to hygiene were all contributing factors to the outbreak of epidemics.
The area around Hungary was regularly struck by plague in this era, some of them lasting as long as three to five years.
Towns were crowded, and public sanitation was a barely understood concept, therefore it is no surprise that town dwellers bore the brunt of the diseases.
In the plague of 1655 nearly half the population of Sopron was wiped out.
In military camps where hygienic conditions were disastrous, besides dysentery and typhus many soldiers fell victim to a disease called morbus hungaricus which has been described in various sources as a horrible epidemic.
Increasing and declining population
By the end of the 15th century the population of Hungary was nearly 3.3 million.
A century later this number had risen to approximately 3.5 to 4 million.
This can be attributed to the fact that despite the Turkish conquest Hungary was no exception to the process which brought along significant increase in the population of early modern Europe.
However, at the beginning of the 18th century the population of Hungary was still around 3,5 million which means that the population level was decreasing or at best was stagnant.
This was primarily the result of the Fifteen Years war (1591-1606) and the re-occupation (1683-1699), in which the Turkish-Tartar armies and the Emperor's troops continually marched through, wintered and laid waste to Hungary leaving the populations of certain areas utterly decimated.
It was especially unfortunate since up to the country's first modern war, citizens had demonstrated an extraordinary ability to survive.
Throughout the ongoing Turkish-Hungarian military encounters the ordinary people had merely fled in search of a more peaceful life, albeit temporary, in the nearby, more protected settlements.
Nevertheless there was no escape from the repeated devastation wrought by armies consisting of thousands of soldiers which relentlessly pressed forward over expansive areas.
The total population of Hungary
According to the latest research, the total population of Hungary at the end of the 15th century including Transylvania and Slavonia was around 3.3 to 3.5 million.
Nearly 900,000 people lived in the 120,000 square kilometre sized occupied area, out of which the total from the Turkish castle garrisons, the tanner land owners and Muslim citizens came to 50-100,000 people.
According to the domestic census of 1598, the population of the 120,000 square kilometre area of Habsburg Hungary is estimated at 1.8 million.
800,000 people lived in the 60,000 square metre area of Transylvania (not including the Partium).
This data indicates that at the end of the 16th century the population of the country was still around 3.5 million which shows little or no increase compared to data of the end of the previous century, this therefore means that the natural growth of the population was stifled by the period of wars.
From the 17th century the available data is less accurate.
The Fifteen Years War and plague and starvation that followed decimated the population.
Warfare of the 1660's and plague epidemics in the periods between 1653-1565, 1660-1666, 1676-1678 led to further losses.
The entire population of Hungary just before the wars of re-occupation in 1683 is considered to have been approximately 4 million.
Exodus from villages
It cannot be doubted that as a result of military campaigns and wars significant movements of peoples took place in the country at certain periods.
After the "major exodus" to forests and swamps because of the wars, the majority of those from the villages returned to their homes and re-continued farming.
Some of the serfs fled from the Hungarian or Turkish tax census and returned after it had been carried out.
The majority of people lived in tiny villages comprising of only 20 or 25 houses.
While in the occupied areas about 140 people lived in an average village, this figure was 150-170 in the kingdom.
More and more villagers moved to agricultural towns, especially in those decades when a boom in agriculture took place.
(The average population density in the occupied areas was 7-8 persons per square kilometre, and in the western part of the country 15 people per square kilometre, while in the most developed areas of Europe this number was 100-120 in Italy, and 34-40 in the Netherlands and France.)
Ethnic re-distribution
The great immigration waves can be connected to the devastation in the population caused by major campaigns.
In the Fifteen Years War for instance a serious loss was experienced by the Hungarian inhabited part of the Mezõség where a significant number of Romanian ethnic groups had settled.
The Transylvanian wars between 1657 and 1661 had similar consequences.
Romanians reached the northern and eastern edges of the lowland of Hungary, and the territories inhabited by Saxons and Székelys (Hungarians of Transylvania).
In both the occupied territories and other parts of the country the most significant devastation effected those living on flat land - mainly Hungarian national habitants - while Romanian, Ruthenian and Slovak citizens who lived in the more protected hilly areas had more chance to escape the campaigns.
In addition, settlers from the German Empire also kept arriving but their number only became significant after the expulsion of the Turks.
The 150 years of Turkish conquest and warfare fundamentally altered the ethnic picture of Hungary in the Middle Ages.
Romanians in Transylvania
Romanians who settled in Transylvania did not form a feudal state.
Those kenézes and vaivodes (both chief titles in the principality) who had excelled themselves before the king and who had been managing the settlement process since the Middle Ages, were given the status of nobility along with land.
However, the majority of Romanians mainly involved in sheep rearing had sunken to the level of serfs after they had moved to a royal property or land that belonged to private land owners.
The main form of tax they paid was the fiftieth sheep tariff, which meant that every fiftieth sheep belonged to the king, and later to the prince.
Besides the shepherding lifestyle, another reason for Romanians being isolated was their Orthodox religion, and their bishopric only became established in 1574 on the command of István Báthory.
Following the devastation of the Fifteen Years War another settlement movement began from the Vajdaság (districts governed by a vaivod) to Transylvania and by the 17th century a significant number of Romanian inhabitants had settled along the Transylvanian riverbanks and the northern and eastern side of the Lowlands of Hungary.
Throughout the 17th century Transylvanian princes paid particular attention to the religious life of the Romanians.
The settlement of Serbs and Croatians
As a result of the Turkish expansion, before the battle of Mohács a significant number of Orthodox Serbs had settled in the southern areas of Hungary.
By the middle of the 16th century a large number of Serbs arrived in the area south of the river Maros and as a continuation to this, to the area between the Danube and the Tisza rivers and to Transdanubia.
The devastation caused by the Fifteen Years War mainly effected the Hungarian inhabited territories of the lowlands which opened the opportunity for the Serbs to move further north.
First they settled at the territories between the Maros and Körös rivers, then throughout the 17th century they continuously reached towards the areas in the north between the Danube and Tisza rivers.
They arrived together with Muslim Bosnians - who were grouped together as Serbs in this historical period.
In 1627 their most northern settlements were near Simontornya and Dunaföldvár.
At the end of the 17th century after the conquest of Belgrade by the Serb forces (1690) several thousand Serbian families arrived in Hungary under the leadership of Arsenije patriarch of Ipek.
Catholic Croatians fled from the Turks to the western side of Transdanubia, and the majority of them worked as mercenaries along the border.
In the 16th and 17th centuries they appeared in increasing numbers in Transdanubia.
Slovaks, Germans and Vlachs in Upper Northern Hungary
The furthest extent of the Hungarian settlements in the 17th century was the Pozsony-Nagyszombat - Rimaszombat - Rozsnyó - the valley of Hernád - the valley of Tarca - Gálszécs - Ungvár - Munkács - Huszt route.
Slovak and Ruthene inhabitants established scattered settlements by river valleys.
Hungarian inhabitants of the Felvidék were further increased by Hungarians fleeing from the Turks from the direction of the lowlands, the majority of whom were Hungarian aristocrats.
People who used to live in German towns at the Felvidék, (mainly in the Szepesség and by the river Garam) lost some of their number when a large Slovak group settled with the Germans.
Small German mining villages by the rivers Rima and Sajó had a fully Slovak character by the end of the 17th century.
The Vlach ethnic group - the people who mainly dealt with shepherding and goat-herding - appeared in the mountains in the 16th century emanating from the direction of Bereg and Máramaros.
These - originally Romanian - shepherds gradually assimilated, and by this time spoke either Slovakian or Ruthenian languages.
The grazing their animals pursued endangered the forests, therefore the mining towns were constantly introducing prohibitions against them.
By the 17th century settlements of Vlach shepherds stretched as far as Moravia.
Turks - Southern Slavonians
The expansion of the Ottoman empire towards the Balkans and its power consolidation was initially ensured by two factors: the mainly Turkish army, and the masses of Turkish settlers of Anatolia.
However, most of this ethnic expansion exhausted itself on reaching the line of the Danube and the river Drava, (some reached certain regions i.e. the Vidin territory in Bulgaria).
Not only Turkish settlers failed to reach Hungary but even the majority of the conquering army was recruited from the different ethnic groups of the Balkans.
The first mixed and often temporary castle garrison of the Buda vilajet (Turkish administrative unit) for example was later replaced by troops exclusively from Bosnia, Herzegovina, Northern-Serbia and from the territory between the rivers Drava and Sava.
The majority of soldiers from the aforementioned places were already converted Muslims when they entered into the service of the Ottoman state (and usually were sent to the more useful arms of the service).
Serb and Vlach soldiers who joined the army from Northern Serbia (from the territory embraced by the rivers Danube, Timok and Sava) served mainly as marauders, and the majority remained Christian.
The ethnic origin of the tanner landowner spahis and their companions who served in Hungary is less known but all indications point to their mainly being renegades.
Thus, in addition to Turkish, the Southern Slavic language was also used in the "Turkish" garrisons and towns.
SETTLEMENT AND PLACE OF LIVING
Towns in Habsburg Hungary in the 16th-17th century
Although Hungary - despite its division into three parts - remained as part of Europe's economic system, wars and the disunity of the country made the development of towns significantly harder.
The urban network system of the Middle Ages had disintegrated as most of Hungary's free royal towns (Buda, Pest, Szeged) came under the direct sway of the Turks.
At the same time live-stock trading significantly added to the wealth of the occupied agricultural towns.
The royal towns (Nagyszombat, Pozsony, Kassa, Sopron, Gyõr) - mainly as mediators - began to be associated with the export of cattle and wine to the western and northern areas, as a result of which the citizens of these towns also derived significant incomes.
The accumulated capital however, was rarely invested in industrial or financial enterprises. Instead, people purchased land and vineyards with the intention of combining the foreign trade with their product.
Town industry therefore remained to operate within the framework of the guild system.
As a result of all these factors Hungarian burghers played a far less important role in the life of the country than the urban dwellers of for example Germany or France.
The centre of Upper Hungary: Kassa
Well before the Battle of Mohács the free royal town of Kassa was one of the most important economic centres of the country.
The Turkish advance altered the picture of this town - which had built out significant trading connections since the Anjous and pursued the guild industry, - both to its favour and disadvantage.
As the border fortress system was established and the Transylvanian Principality came into being, Kassa became the military and diplomatic centre of the upper Hungarian region for the 1560s.
Here, the captain general of Upper Hungary who was resident in the town directed the defence of the border fortresses and the relations with princes and the Turks.
At the same time, Kassa was also the centre for tax administration, since the town was a home to the residence of the Szepes Chamber, the organisation which administrated the royal income in this part of the country.
The aforementioned functions Kassa performed gave it a more significant national role than before.
However, its citizens paid a hard price for this advantage: they often had to put up with the captain general's interference in the town's affairs even though the military created a new market for the town traders and master craftsmen.
Even under the Turks the town developed economically, due to the fact that it managed to keep its previous leading role in the trade and industrial life of the Northeast of Hungary.
These were all contributing factors to the fact that Kassa more or less managed to preserve its royal town privileges throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.
The bastion of Vienna the imperial capital: Gyõr
In the life of the bishopric agricultural town of Gyõr, the Turkish occupation had brought enormous changes.
After the fall of Székesfehérvár and Esztergom in 1543, Gyõr which is situated by the river Rába had moved near to the Turkish front-line.
In consequence, the Viennese management of war had established the town as the military administration centre of the defence headquarters of the imperial capital.
They transformed Gyõr into a modern stronghold, the so-called fort town (Festugstadt), created a symmetrical network of streets, raised ramparts and strengthened defence by several hundred Hungarian and German soldiers.
Military purposes by far became the priority against the interest of the town's citizenry, the captain general limited the freedom and economic activities of the people.
Being close to the Turkish front-line, however, also brought advantages to the town.
Firstly, the military became a new market for the town traders and master craftsmen, secondly, the Gyõr merchants took advantage of the opportunity to get involved in cattle trading as mediators between the Turkish occupied areas and the West, which was the most profitable branch of the economy of the era and its citizens could preserve and even broaden their privileges.
As a result of all this, in the 16th and 17th centuries Gyõr became one of the most significant towns.
Buda in the Turkish era
Buda, the Renaissance capital of King Mátyás became the military and administrative centre of a vast empire's border province in 1541, a pasha-residence.
Although throughout the 150 years of occupation its Hungarian population remained, the number decreased by half.
They were replaced by (mainly Serb and Bosnian origin) Muslim, Jewish and Gypsy ethnic groups most of them soldiers, officers and traders.
The total population nevertheless was still less (by 7000-7500) than under King Mátyás.
The different religious groups lived separately.
The Turks occupied the empty or evacuated houses but hardly built any new ones.
They only erected public buildings that their lifestyle required (djamis, mosques, spas, schools, soup kitchens and bazaars) even these were transformed from or built on the top of Hungarian middle-ages architecture.
The economic life of this Balkan style border town was determined by three different branches of industry: handicraft (within this the typically Turkish industries, i.e. leather and copper) agriculture (viniculture and viticulture, cultivation of grain crops and market gardening) and trading.
Although the majority of the trading of goods between the royal and the occupied territories of Hungary were carried out via Buda which was an enormous source of income for the Turkish tax collectors, the town lost its previous role of being an economic centre and a market leader.
Transylvanian towns
The largest towns of Transylvania were those mainly Saxon towns (Nagyszeben, Brassó, Beszterce, Segesvár, Medgyes, Kolozsvár) which - in the late Middle Ages as a result of their dominating role over trading routes that ran across Transylvania and by dealing with Levantine goods - became extremely wealthy by the beginning of the 16th century.
Because of Transylvania being relatively cut off from trading routes, the development of Saxon towns gradually slowed to halt throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, since part of the most important trading routes towards Moldavia and Wallachia were closed.
Nevertheless the world-famous goldsmith products of the Saxon handicraft industry still reached the western European markets through Southern German trading links by which Saxon towns were able to maintain their wealth even under the reign of Transylvanian princes.
Transylvanian agricultural towns came into being near the largest settlements with the largest markets but in smaller numbers and with far fewer inhabitants (Marosvásárhely, Udvarhely). The majority of them became so called "tax" towns which meant that they were granted privileges by the Prince and paid their taxes to the principal treasury in one sum.
Rich Kolozsvár
This Saxon town which became Hungarian by the end of the 16th century had played a leading role in the history of Transylvania.
Its domination over the trading route that led to Hungary and the right to block the passage of commodities which they had been granted by Queen Isabel in 1558 played an important role in the town becoming rich.
Princes of Transylvania often spent their time in this town and this encouraged the locals to build small Renaissance castles and new houses thus making Kolozsvár a worthy residence.
In the last third of the 16th century an architectural fever came over the citizens, entire streets were beautified or transformed making Kolozsvár the second capital of Transylvania after Gyulafehérvár.
Under Italian influence, local stone carving artists decorated the gates, frontages and arches in the Transylvanian Renaissance style characterised by an abundant use of flowers.
The simple elegance of the Renaissance arcaded loggias met the individual characteristics of the local architecture, which could especially be observed in the town's larger houses and country houses outside the town.
Wealth was accompanied by a sparkling cultural life from the second half of the 16th century and a great variety of literature on religious disputes, fiction and scientific literature became available for the readers from Gáspár Heltai's printing house in Kolozsvár.
Gyulafehérvár
Upon her return to Transylvania in 1556 queen Isabel's first priority was to try and convert the abandoned bishopric palace of Gyulafehérvár into a worthy principal residence.
The halls were mainly decorated with silver and golden objects, as well as silk and brocade drapery.
The town became a real Renaissance principal residence under the reign of the Báthorys.
Several Transylvanian aristocratic families attempted to buy a property or hoped to receive one as a gift from the Prince in Gyulafehérvár, which was the most regularly chosen venue for assemblies as well as functioning as a residential town in the principality.
Temesvár under the Turks
While Buda played the role of the Porte for Vienna, due to its geographical location the mission of Temesvár was the observation of Transylvania under the leadership of the local begler bey (and the 6-7,000 fortress soldiers and spahis subordinated to him).
Similarly to Buda, the town became more Turkish and took on the characteristics of a country town.
The town's old castle was used by the occupiers as an internal fortress where only military buildings were built and where the commander of the castle lived.
One of the two outlying areas of the town was called "Rácváros" "the Serb quarter" and Turkish mosques were erected everywhere - including the Serb quarters.
The immediate surroundings of the town became swampy from small tributaries coming out of the river Temes and the town itself was built on such soft ground that its streets had to be covered by plank-walks fixed on piles.
Business life took place on one of the streets of the inner town centre where the market place full of shops was also located.
Besides mosques, caravan seraglios, spas, schools and cafes also contributed to the oriental look of the town.
The majority of Temesvár's Turkish and Serb inhabitants lived in houses consisting of one room plus a kitchen and a small yard.
Their vineyard and orchids were situated outside the town, among which could be found the Dervish monasteries.
The "independent" agricultural towns of the Sultans in the Lowlands of Hungary (the Alföld)
The richest agricultural towns of the occupied areas usually belonged to the treasury either for its use or as its property.
Turkish administrators, soldiers or civilians either never lived in these colonies or if they did so, they had definitely left by the end of the 16th century.
These towns bought their independence for huge tax payments.
Turkish authorities established these constantly increasing taxes which were paid in cash and commodities, and were submitted to Turkish officials through the town's representatives.
This provided the opportunity for these towns to pursue independent management, maintain their own households and to settle their legal disputes in accordance with Hungarian laws and the statutes of the town.
Management, administrative and judicial duties were carried out by the town council led by an annually elected chief justice, minutes and the rendering of accounts were kept by a notary.
The different management activities were directed by lower ranking magistrates (such as wine, market and residential magistrates).
Church and school maintenance were paid for by the town, as was the invitation and expenses of the priest.
The independence and self-defence of these agricultural communities which were reinforced by the 17th century was a compelling attraction to people living in villages.
Settlements with lodging gardens
Before the Battle of Mohács the Lowlands of Hungary (the Alföld) had been covered by densely populated villages.
Following the country's division into three parts villages were desolated one after the other, and the people were either reduced to slavery or forced to seek refuge in another village not yet destroyed where they were safer in large numbers.
These places grew into agricultural towns and expanded onto the borders of the ruined villages.
By the reign of the Hunyadis Debrecen already had a 90,000 cadaster hectares of border area, this figure was 50,000 in Nagykõrös and the area of 6 ruined villages became the property of Kecskemét.
Uncultivated lands near the borders of these widely spread agricultural towns and giant villages of the Lowlands with long boundary lines, were primarily cultivated in their inner zones.
The rest of the uncultivated border lands were used for grazing and animal husbandry.
According to historical data, the large herd of cows that were sent to the West were mainly raised on the grazing lands of agricultural towns of the Hungarian Lowlands.
Cattle rearing and exports became common in Hungary on a large scale from the second half of the 15th century.
Hungarian cattle was sought after by Venice from the Southwest and the expanding German towns (Vienna, Augsburg, Nürnberg) purchased the lion's share, although there was still enough left to supply the Czech and Moldavian towns.
For example in Nürnberg in the first half of the 16th century 70,000 cattle per year were sold, while in Vienna 7-11,000 cows per week were purchased in the summer months.
The rapidly flourishing cattle rearing required vast areas of grazing land.
These were available in the Lowlands of Hungary particularly in the area between the rivers Danube and Tisza.
Kecskemét was one of the few towns to survive Turkish destruction and thus provided shelter to refugees from the neighbouring villages that were destroyed and slowly expanded over the borderlines of the deserted villages.
Rented lands were divided into summer and winter pastures.
Animals of poorer people were driven into common stud farms and herds grazed on the summer pasture together.
That part of the land which was suitable for cultivation was used to keep the animals on in winter.
These lands were broken, ploughed and sowed and used for the cultivation of grain crops and for the wintering of cattle herds.
The grazing lands were called the lodgings, gardens or farmsteads.
However, in this case the garden was not cultivated land but rather an open-air, spacious pen where the animals were kept in order to prevent them from wandering away.
Rural gardens could come into being on both the inner boundaries of the agricultural towns and in the distant lands.
The most ancient agricultural gardens were occupied freely.
These lands were than inherited by, given to and bought by the following generations.
(In Nagykõrös these were called the "forefather's legacy" gardens).
In the 16-17th centuries the situation in Kecskemét was similar to that in Szeged, in the Jászság and Nagykunság.
In 1570 the Turkish census takers counted 154 lodgings on the border of Szeged and on its lands.
The 16th century Szeged lodgings were used for different purposes such as hay-making, the wintering of animals and cultivation of land.
The landowners of these lodgings were mostly well-off smallholders and civis peasants (well-to-do peasants who had been able to move to towns) but sometimes they belonged to handicraftsmen or even Turkish functionaries.
Another type of agricultural town were the hajdú towns (towns in county Hajdú in the 17th century) which were founded for defence purposes in areas that had been destroyed by the Turks.
The core of these towns - the inner town which consisted of houses around the church - was surrounded by a rampart and strong palisade.
The garden with its livestock, agricultural products and tools was situated outside the palisade.
In Hajdúböszörmény even the garden was surrounded by a rampart which has retained its circular shape up today.
Ottoman-Turkish architecture
The architecture of the Turks who had mostly settled in towns or were stationed in the occupied fortresses, had two different aspects.
Military architecture consisted of the reinforcement of castles and in the cases of more important centres - in Buda or Esztergom for example - the establishment of defensive-works.
Civilian architecture was meant to serve the everyday needs of the settled Turks.
The characteristics of the occupied Hungarian settlements went through a gradual transformation under the Turkish conquest.
In larger towns the characteristics of Turkish architecture appeared within a few years: djamis, mosques, medreses (schools), türbes and spas which were indispensable for the Turks.
The conquerors often re-converted buildings of the Hungarian architecture of the Middle Ages for their own use, particularly public buildings.
Despite this reconstruction Hungarian towns managed to preserve their structure and street network.
After the re-occupation at the end of the 17th century, Turkish buildings disappeared within a few decades and under the large scale town re-structuring that took place in the 19th century, forts and defensive works were utterly demolished.
Djamis
The main examples of architecture of Ottoman and Turkish origin in Hungary consist of djamis and mosques.
The majority of these buildings were either partially or fully constructed from Christian churches.
The inner decoration -altar pictures and ornaments were removed, and wall paintings and frescos were given a white wash.
Where the opportunity presented itself - as in the case of the Parish Church in the town centre of Pest - the Turks established a mihrab-alcove in the southern wall of the sanctuary.
Throughout the occupation, significant re-construction work was carried out at the southern side of the "Feast of the Assumption" church which was converted in some haste into a djami by the Turks after the occupation of Buda in 1541, without altering its characteristic body and gothic ground plan structure.
A similar case was the Saint George church in the Buda Castle.
By the side of the building - preserving its medieval architecture - the Turks built a separate minaret.
An original example for utilising already existing buildings is the Uzicseli Hadzsi Ibrahin djami in Esztergom which was established throughout the reconstruction of the gate house of the city wall from the 13th century.
We can distinguish two different fundamental types of djamis that were of Turkish origin from their foundation.
The first, well known type consists of square surfaced buildings with a cupola that rested on an octagonal tambour in the outside and on a circular shaped drum in the inside.
In most cases the main frontage was extended by a three vaulted porch which was also covered by a cupola.
When praying Muslims must face towards Mecca therefore djamis built in Hungary were also orientated to the Southeast.
The mihrab alcove was situated right in the middle of the buildings' South-western wall, the pulpit and the minbar stood next to it.
Opposite this, on the Northwest side opened the entrance of the building and next in the Northwest corner stood the minaret which was usually built together with the building and opened from either inside the djami or from the porch.
The most beautiful example of this type of djami is the Gázi Kászim pasha djami in Pécs, which was built over the medieval architecture of the church of Saint Bertalan by using its stones in the seventies of the 16th century.
The still standing Jakováli Hassan djami in Pécs, the djami of Malkocs bey in Siklós and the Ali Pasha djami in Szigetvár are also examples of the aforementioned category.
Buildings with a rectangular-shaped ground plan and horizontal or tent roofing formed the other group of djamis.
Research so far has uncovered two such buildings which were both built after 1566 in the fortresses of Gyula and Szigetvár.
Today only the Suleiman-djami of Szigetvár remains, the one in Gyula had been demolished to its foundations.
Its original form was reconstructed on the basis of the excavation work carried out in this area and based on engravings found from the 18th century.
Its still existing minaret preserves the memory of the Kethüdá djami erected in Eger at the beginning of the 17th century and the Hamzsa bey djami in Érd.
Türbes standing on an octagonal ground plan and covered by cupolas were built on the occupied areas in large numbers, however, only two of those have survived until the present day.
The Gül Baba türbe in Buda was built by Jahjapasazáde Mehmed pasha between 1543 and 1548, over the grave of Gül Baba a dervish of Bektas who died during the first Friday prayer that followed the occupation of Buda castle.
The Idrisz Baba türbe in Pécs which was built at the end of the 16th century shares architectural similarities with the above mentioned türbe.
According to tradition, the entrails of Suleiman I. sultan (1520-1566) - who led the a 1566 attack against Szigetvár castle - were buried in Turbék.
This white marble building with an octagonal ground plan and a cupola was a famous place of pilgrimage under the occupation, the exact location of which is no longer known.
Spas
Turkish spas can be divided into two different groups.
The first group is the Ilidzse which include hot- and thermal springs built on natural springs and the other category is the hamam, the steam bath.
The difference between the two groups is their water supply and their way of heating, however, there are no significant differences between their ground plans.
The structure of both followed that of the Roman baths.
Both ilidzses and hamams were built on the Turkish occupied Hungarian territories.
Medieval Hungarian architecture was also reconstructed for building spas by the settling conquerors, particularly in those areas where natural sources of hot springs were found.
For instance the Emperor (Veli bey) spa as well as the Rác and Rudas spas (Jesil direkli - Green column) which are operating today in Buda, used to be Turkish baths.
On their location bathing establishments were situated as early as the 15th century, only the medieval history of the Király (King) Bath is unknown.
It was founded by Szokollu Mustafa pasha (1566-1578), and it is unanimously referred to as the "Rooster Gate" by Turkish historical sources.
It was also a thermal spring bath, although its water was fed through clay-pipes from a water source that gushed from the garden of what is today the Lukács bath.
In the town of Eger two Turkish baths were built.
The Arnaut pasha bath in the garden of the bishopric palace which is still in use was saved from deterioration by Károly Eszterházy. He reconstructed the building, and in fact expanded it by another two premises.
The Valide sultana steam bath situated opposite the entrance of the Eger castle was only used for a short while after the re-occupation, and is not mentioned in any historical sources after 1765.
The name of Güzeldzse Rüsztem pasha of Buda (1559-1563) is associated with the foundation of two baths in Hungary.
One is an ilidzse which was built on top of the Esztergom-Víziváros (spa town) and was named after the pasha himself, and another was a hamam of Székesfehérvár with the same name.
Today, only the ground work of both buildings exists.
Out of the several Turkish baths of Pécs that are referred to by historical sources, remains of the bath that was built as part of Memi pasha's endowment have been recently excavated.
WAY OF LIFE
ECONOMY
In the economic bloodstream of Europe
Although Hungary was indefinitely divided into three parts after 1541, its economic unity continued to exist throughout the Turkish era.
This economic stability was of mutual benefit to the occupying Turks and to those in control of royal Hungary.
Due to this fact Hungary continued to be an integral part of the economic bloodstream of Europe.
Hungarian raw materials and agricultural products were indispensable to Western Europe, and in return for such materials the country primarily exported textiles, iron goods and various luxury items.
The cattle trade, which originated from the occupied territories (an approximate 200,000 animals per year) provided the meat supply for Northern-Italy, the southern German areas and for the imperial capital which qualified Hungary as the world's largest meat exporter.
Its easily transportable wine was also exported to various parts of Europe.
Besides the breeding of cattle, wine production and grain crop cultivation - which mainly took place on large estates for the local markets - trading was the most characteristic and most profitable branch in the Hungarian economy.
This provided the opportunity for many people to become wealthy, or even to rise to the ranks of the nobility, while in Turkish occupied Hungary it was a chance for survival.
The significance of the large estates
The basis of political, military and economic power in Hungary under Turkish occupation was the large estate.
The most significant big-land owners of the country (Batthyánys, Nádasdys, Esterházys, Zrínyis, Széchys, Thurzós, the Drughets of Hommonna, the Csákys) owned estates that extended across several counties over which the authorities of the state and the county could only exert their authority with the agreement of the landlord.
The majority of big-land owners had acquired their lands throughout the Middle Ages, while another group won their lands in the 16-17th centuries through planned marriage policy and as payment for their services.
With their estates, the landowners represented a strong economic power since besides grain crops and wine production they also got involved with cattle trading.
In the kingdom, - which had been squeezed into a narrow strip - large estates were given an important role in border defence.
Landowners' private soldiers and the king's border troops fought together against the Turkish attacks.
As well as the splendid noble courts set up in castles functioning as administrative headquarters, they were also important cultural centres.
The opportunities for industrialisation and its limitations
In the 16-17th centuries the boom in agriculture and long-distance trading based on its products had significantly limited the possibilities of the already underdeveloped Hungarian industry.
Cheap manufactured products that were pouring into the country in return for raw-materials and food products also discouraged the development of the handicraft industry.
Mining too, failed to reach its previous level. Constant wars were only favourable to a minority of master craftsmen who joined the industry provisioning the army dealing with the manufacturing of arms and war supplies.
Hungarian industry continued to be based on the guild system and it was only the gold and silversmith industry that managed to develop to a higher standard.
The number of guilds had nevertheless significantly increased (especially those of tailors' processing cheap textiles from the West) as opposed to manufacturing production which only appeared in the most significant towns of Hungary (Pozsony, Sopron, Nagyszombat, Kassa) and - on a very basic level - in the iron and glass making industries.
In the 17th century the first characteristic elements of a capitalist enterprise only appeared in the monopolised mining industry.
Peoples' tax burden in royal Hungary
While the nobility paid the country with their blood, subjects of royal Hungary were made to pay a wide range of taxes.
A serf had to pay tax to his king as well as to his landlord and to the church.
One part of their tax and the various services had to be paid in money, while the other part was paid in kind and labour.
Military tax (dica) which was constantly voted for in order to defend against the Turks was paid by the serfs in money, and the mandatory free labour (gratuitus labor) was offered to be paid either in defensive military service in the fortresses or to be redeemed by money.
Serfs owed their landlords not only the ninth (nona) quota on wheat and wine, and paid a ground rent (census) for the use of land, but they paid their lords in gifts and other dues as well.
To the Church, serfs had to deliver a tenth quota of their crop (tithe, decima) but the county also taxed villains (household tax) in order to supply their own needs.
In addition to this, from the second half of the 17th century the imperial regiments that were stationed in Hungary, further increased the burden on the serfs by making them pay other taxes (portion, forspont).
Despite all the tax burdens some serfs still managed to enrich themselves.
Transylvania's economy in the 16th century
As a result of its geographical and economical isolation Transylvania could not join the thriving agriculture which developed under the impact of economic changes in Europe.
The cultivation of grain crops and animal husbandry only covered local needs.
In 1568 the Porte prohibited trading between Transylvania and Moldavia - Wallachia which further increased its economic isolation.
The limited small, inner market had repercussions on town development, too.
Transylvanian agricultural towns had little in common with the towns in the Lowlands of Hungary (the Alföld) in regard to either their populations or economic roles.
The guild industry stagnated at the medieval level even though certain branches of industry became specialised.
From among the Saxon towns only Nagyszeben managed to preserve its wealth.
Kolozsvár, which gradually became a town with a Hungarian majority, was the only town that showed steady economic growth thanks to its right to control and block the passage of commodities to Hungary and Vienna - a right they had been granted by Queen Isabelle in 1558.
The treasury of the principality
In the organisation of independent Transylvania's state income György Fráter's activity as a treasurer (1542-1551) played an important role by the treasury management of the later principality.
The most significant income was the regale income which primarily consisted of the profits from salt mining (Dés, Torda, Kolozs, Szék, Vízakna), precious metal mining (Abrudbánya, Offenbánya, Körösbánya, Zalatna, Nagybánya), and the exchange of gold as well as minting.
Princes of Transylvania were usually the owners of the biggest lands, since in addition to their family estates they owned vast estates of the princely Exchequer.
Fortress estates which consisted of numerous villages (Kovár, Huszt, Szamosújvár, Somlyó, Jenõ, Várad, Lugos, Karánsebes, Déva, Gyulafehérvár) delivered a not insignificant income to the treasury.
By the end of the century a strict thirtieth quota system was formed alongside the western boundaries of the principality where duties were also a great sources of income.
Tax which was annually voted for by the Diet and had to be paid for by all three regions also added to the aforementioned.
The treasury income by the middle of the 16th century is estimated to have been 100,000 forints, this figure being estimated at 300,000 under the Báthorys.
Gábor Bethlen's economic policy
The fact that Bethlen had managed to render the treasury's income independent from the estates was a major contributing factor to his establishment of a firm central power.
The 60,000 forints annual tax, which was voted for by the estates, amounted only to 10 percent of the treasury's income, which was a total of 600-700,000 forints per year.
Although Bethlen inherited an obsolete tax system from his predecessors, he respected the rights of the nobility and did not make any changes to the system.
Similarly, he did not introduce the progressive taxation of towns either, which made him look for alternative forms of taxation.
In Bethlen's well thought-out, pre-mercantile economic policy trade monopolies were given significant roles.
Prince Bethlen not only traded Transylvanian salt, precious metals and mercury but also sold cattle, animal skins and wax abroad at a profit.
In order to boost the mining industry he invited German miners to Transylvania.
In 1615 he revised all property donations dated back to 1588 and took everything back he could into the property of the Exchequer.
He placed restrictions on the collection of benefits originating from the exchange of gold and from minting.
The boosting of the economy resulted in more money being introduced into circulation, which brought wealth to Transylvania and ensured the required financial background for the military campaigns of the Prince.
The economy of Transylvania at the end of the 17th century
In the crisis period between 1657 and 1664 Transylvania suffered major devastation.
The principality lost towns, customs points and trading routes.
Apafi arrested this financial decline with a firm hand: by introducing strict controls on the money exchange and by banning the export of precious metals.
The princely monopoly on the trading of traditional mining products such as salt, copper, mercury and gold had brought significant rewards to the treasury.
The cultivation of wheat and garden products took on a new momentum and sheep and cattle breeding continued.
After a difficult start to the period, new forges, glass-houses and paper-mills indicated the beginning of the manufacturing industry.
Many of these workshops operated on the territories of treasury domains.
Traders originating from the Balkans but collectively referred to as Greeks re-vitalised the circulation of commodities and money, but quite a few Transylvanian aristocrats dealt with trading, too.
The prince tried to fill the financial gaps of the state budget by raising taxes (taxes on manors were raised from 10 forints in 1664 to 50 forints in 1686).
The last three decades of independent Transylvania were characterised by stable economic growth, industrialisation and wealth.
Taxing of subjects in the occupied territories
Turkish income in Hungary was derived from two sources: from the agricultural production of serfs (raia) and from the taxation of products.
Taxes from land cultivators can be divided into two groups: the so called "landowners'" and the state taxes.
The "landowners'" tax consisted of a tenth quota of crops and live-stock (wheat, must, sheep, pigs, fish etc.) the various revenues (i.e. bride tax, various fines) and the so called "gate tax" and these belonged to those who were granted certain settlements as lands of merits (land pertaining to service) (or the treasurer was entitled to them if the settlement was the property of a sultan).
The state tax in the 16th century more or less included the dzsizje and the occasional emergency military tax, which from the second half of the 17th century developed into regular annual taxes.
At the beginning, several settlements paid an annual established tax (lump sum) but from the 1650s this form of tax payment was not enforced.
Serfs were also responsible for supplying the wintering soldiers and carrying out maintenance work on the Turkish fortresses.
Taxes and services were constantly increasing but with significant regional differences.
The more protected agricultural towns, customs areas and larger villages were taxed by the treasury itself, which had willingly handed over the same task to its officers and soldiers in the territories along the borders.
Double taxation and the condominium
Even the dense chain of border fortresses which sealed the boundaries of royal Hungary and Transylvania could not prevent the authorities of the opposing side from collecting taxes from the serfs living in the enemy territory.
Hungarian border fortress soldiers were particularly good at doing this, the result of which was that within a few decades they managed to restore the taxation system of the Hungarian nobility over almost the entire area of the occupied territories, and to a lesser extent that of the state and the Church.
By the 17th century descendants of aristocrats who had escaped the occupation had more or less managed to regain their old properties, at the same time the surviving noble counties began to resume their activities.
They not only taxed the villains of the occupied territories - but by prohibiting their turning to the Turkish authorities (this was called being "Turkish-like") they partially extended county jurisdiction and public administration over the serfs.
This is called "double rule" (condominium) which played a huge role in maintaining an awareness of the Hungarian state unity.
"In return" the Turks forced several Hungarian settlements to pay tax but they did not even try to interfere by either law or through their authority in peoples' everyday lives.
The development of agricultural towns in the occupied territories
Since the most profitable branch of the economy in the Turkish era was the rearing and trading of cattle, this encouraged the enrichment of those settlements that took part in this work.
The peasantry of the "three occupied towns" (Nagykõrös, Cegléd, Kecskemét) and several others which later declined such as (Kálmáncsehi, Tolna, Ráckeve, Mezõtúr, and Simánd) pursued with cattle rearing on rented steppe land and began to trade with the West.
Since the breeding and the driving of the animals took place in herds of several hundred cows, it meant that tens of thousands of peasants were involved in production and trade.
Later this enriched peasantry of the agricultural towns and villages played an important role in the survival of the local governments of these Hungarian settlements - and this despite the Turkish occupation.
The most enthusiastic entrepreneurs (i.e. the grand-grand father of Imre Thököly, Sebestyén) gradually left the occupied territory, and by gaining civil rights in some of the towns of royal Hungary (Nagyszombat, Kassa) they continued to organise the network of connections with the occupied areas.
Wine production and trading in the occupied territory
Hungary's best wine in the Middle Ages was produced in the Szerémség situated between the river Száva and the Danube.
This wine which was also sought after outside the country was transported on the Danube and the Tisza river to major distribution centres (mainly to Pest).
The role of this wine producing area - which began to decline after the 1521 and 1526 Turkish attacks and the fleeing of the inhabitants - was initially carried on by the Somogy and Baranya-Tolna regions.
The long-distance distribution of the wines produced here was made possible by their high quality and the water transport available nearby.
As early as the 17th century, wine was regularly transported to the large towns of the territory between the Danube and Tisza rivers (the citizenry of which in the meantime acquired a taste for the Alföld's red wine which was exported and distributed by Serbs).
However, by the turn of the 16th - 17th century the Tokaj-Hegyalja region became the best quality wine producing region, where in the following decades the production of the special "Aszu" (dry) wine had began.
By the end of the century these drinks became famous all over Europe.
(In this region only the vineyards of Gyöngyös and Miskolc had come under Turkish rule.)
Although the wines of Hegyalja were primarily consumed in the Felvidék (the Upper-Hungarian region) and in Poland, they were also sold in certain places within the occupied territory.
Hungarian, Muslim, Jewish and Greek merchants in the occupied areas
The most important products among Hungarian exports in the 16th century (cattle, animal skins etc.) were produced in the regions under Turkish rule.
Since the first Habsburg-Turkish trading agreement was only signed in 1615 and Turkish subjects were not allowed to enter royal Hungary for a long time, - the distribution of products between the occupied areas and royal Hungary was mainly carried out by Hungarian merchants from the occupied territories.
The Turkish subjects (Muslims, Jews, Balkan Slavs, Greeks and Dalmatians) were the first to get involved in domestic trade within the occupied areas.
Later however, the so called "Turkish products" they dealt with (different textiles, woollen and cotton fabrics, padding material, soft linen, leather products, carpets and cushions) became more and more sought for outside the occupied areas, too.
In the 17th century these articles were sold by "Greek" merchants (in reality Serb, Armenian, Greek, Dalmatian, Bulgarian, Albanian in other words: non-Muslim subjects of the Turks) who began to settle in the Transylvanian Principality and in some of the important centres of royal Hungary (in Gyõr, Komárom, Kassa and towns east of the river Tisza) in growing numbers from the 1620's.
By utilising their privileges, these merchants slowly monopolised the mediator trading between the two realms.
CRAFTSMANSHIP
Hungarian handcraftsmanship
In the period of Turkish occupation in Hungary, a section of the master craftsmen worked, paid rent and paid in kind as a villain of the region's landlord in the villages and agricultural towns.
The most skilled craftsmen were grouped together in guilds.
In the 15-16th centuries the number of guilds increased and the range of industrial branches expanded in the royal towns, Church centres, seigniorial agricultural towns and in the mining villages.
In places which were occupied by the Turks and were under the Sultan's protection (i.e. Nagykõrös and Kecskemét) the continuation of the guild handcraftsmanship can be observed.
Contemporary records provide evidence on a wide variety of master handicraftsmen occupation in the villages and agricultural towns, which often indicated the profession of people by their names.
For example Péter Boots was a master boot maker, Ferenc Piper a Turkish pipe-maker, John Gun a gun-maker, John Turner a turner.
As Péter Roussel captain general of Tokaj and Szendrõ once wrote in his letter to the king in 1574 - in which he recommended a certain valiant called Tailor - Hungarians prefer to replace the first name of master craftsmen onto the name of their profession.
According to the registration of the minutes from 1609 in Komárom, 16 butchers lived in the town at the time and all 16 were called Butcher.
Millers, bakers and gingerbread makers
In the provisioning of towns and agricultural towns millers and butchers played the most important role.
In Transdanubia and at the upper regions of Hungary, numerous rivers and streams including the Danube provided the opportunity for the building of water and, boat mills while in the area between the Danube and Tisza rivers grinding was carried out by horse gear dry mills and wind mills.
The Old Hungarian language preserved a rich selection of words people used for mill.
For example the "mill of hell" was only going around in showers and rain (in hellish weather).
The "mill crying cloud" could only work when it rained.
The "gurgler" was a mill built on a stream.
At many places carver millers who every now and again carried out the maintenance work were also part of the manor houses and castles.
Administrative bodies of towns stipulated the obligations of millers in separate rules of law.
In 1571 the town of Brasso decreed that a miller who does not own a mill cannot hire carpenters to build one but only millers who know about mill building.
The mill supervisor who was appointed within a guild was obliged to check mills twice a year and fine those who did not comply with the stipulations.
The number of bakers was insignificant during this period.
It is certain, that bread baking took place on a self supply basis in the towns and villages as well as in noble houses.
The bakers of Buda received their regulations in 1681.
In the Middle Ages they mainly specialised in making gingerbread cakes and confectionery items.
Their first appearance is primarily known to have been Western Hungary.
The first independent Hungarian gingerbread making guild was founded in 1681.
Gingerbread makers were regularly present at fairs and places of pilgrimage.
They sold gingerbread cakes for direct consumption and as decorative objects too, made bragget and hydromel; sold cast and dipped candles which were made out of beeswax.
Some of the carved shapes that were used for making gingerbread were made by the master craftsmen themselves.
We have knowledge of excellent carvers from the 16th century who worked in Pest, Debrecen, in the towns of the upper Hungarian region and in the western region of Hungary.
Butchers and oil pressers
The majority of butchers' guilds were formed from the 15th century onwards in densely populated areas.
To ensure the best possible provision of the people, butcher shop tenants and owners of the towns, manors and villages had to adhere to strict regulations.
It was also stipulated that purchasing wax was the prerogative of soap makers, and the buying of leather of the local shoemakers' and tanners'.
In the Lowlands of Hungary butchers themselves traded in live stock.
Lard, bacon and suet which are the by-products of the processing of cattle, sheep and pigs became the raw material for soap and candle making.
Soap making became well known around this time and soap was used for washing besides potash water, sodium carbonate and soapwort.
The earliest soap making guilds were formed in the handicraft centre in the territory of the east side of the river Tisza.
The first guild we know of was founded in Debrecen in 1598.
The earliest oil presser guild we know of was the one in Eperjes in 1517.
Master craftsmen of towns who were granted civil rights were obliged to press good quality oil which had to contain half a bushel of hemp or flax seed of their own.
The oil was always supposed to be pure.
Oil barrels had to be provided with the masters' own mark, in other words it was forbidden to mix hemp oil with flax oil.
The council also stipulated that hemp and flaxseeds could only be bought up by guilds.
In this way oil pressers took on the role of sufficiently provisioning the towns.
Pot ash and sulpetre making as well as the processing of native soda were never part of the guild system, these jobs were ruled by royal decrees.
Since the sulpetre is a gunpowder component, sulpetre making serving military purposes.
Potash (caustic soda) and native soda were mainly used for soap making and played an important role in the daily washing of the peasantry.
Metal processing
The village practice of iron making the work stages of which were mining, smelting, foundry processing and blacksmithing are known from Torocko and its surroundings.
Torocko was one of the most significant iron processing centres of Transylvania.
A large number of blacksmiths, locksmiths and gunsmiths were employed here who produced ploughshares, tools and various articles for personal use.
Forge makers of county Gömör founded a guild in Jolsva in 1585 the regulations of which were issued by the castellan of Murány.
On the products of forge makers, the different price fixing provides us with information which is highly conclusive as regards the tool stock used at the time.
Numerous foundries were operating in Borsod, Abaúj, Nógrád, and Gömör counties.
These products can be found listed in the price fixing of smiths'.
(Besides the regular blacksmith works flat iron, bar iron, hoes, pickaxes, plough iron especially designed for the Lowlands of Hungary, skives, clod breakers, chains, axes, scythes, sickles and hammers were also present).
In the production of iron household equipment master blacksmiths played an important role.
In the 17th century particularly in the western baronial centres and agricultural towns, smiths, cartwrights and locksmiths often joined in one common guild.
From the inventories of certain estates such as the Rákóczi estate from the 17th century we get an idea of what kinds of tools were used in the workshops of blacksmiths and locksmiths'.
The blacksmith and locksmith workshops of agricultural towns and villages dealt mainly with repair work (the adjustment of plough shares, repairs and iron work on carts, sharpening, horse shoeing, iron works on doors and windows) and made locks, spurs, shoe horses and bridle bits.
Master leather processing craftsmen
Tanners who were the master craftsmen of leather processing were famous far and wide in this era.
The Hungarian style leather processing was even known in France.
Harness makers also worked with leather.
In the 15-16th centuries boot-makers were distinct from shoemakers.
Turkish fashion which made its appearance and became increasingly popular in the 16th century resulted in the word boots being referred to as footwear worn by Hungarians.
The masterpiece-rule of guilds in this era even stipulated how to make a "pair of hooked buckskin boots", "a fine pair of slippers", and a "pair of fine, graceful boots", all of which had to be made out of crimson, furthermore it stated how the master-to-be should "prepare and cut out" the crimson.
Master craftsmen of towns made farm boots and those for gentlemen differently.
The boots for the Gentry were made out of quality Spanish leather, while farm boots were pointed, pleated and their leg was decorated with a blue ribbon.
A joint shield-maker, horse-dealer and harness-maker venture was founded In Nagyszombat in 1568.
In western Hungary German and Hungarian harness-makers became distinct in the 16th century.
Hungarians were making tools for equipage and horse saddling while German master craftsmen produced the saddles.
Besides the processing of sheep and goatskins, fur-traders worked with and processed the fur of various types of game.
We only have knowledge about their guilds from the 15th century onwards.
The majority of the fur was used for the clothing of the aristocrats, and later in the more wealthy town-wear (the making of gloves, padding for fur caps, the sewing of fur-coats and sheepskin waist coats).
The largest and most decorated leather ware were the fur-coats, wide sheepskin-coats and sheepskin waist coats in both Transdanubia and the Lowlands of Hungary.
Distinguishing between the noble and rustic ware was strictly adhered to, particularly in the Calvinist agricultural towns of the Lowlands.
The reason why György Dékány, a milking shepherd was punished in 1698 by the Kecskemét council was that he had an unsuitably fancy sheepskin waist coat made for him which was taken off him by the council while the man himself was thrashed with a stick.
The fur-dealer who made the coat was locked up in jail where he was made to unstitch all the finery off the sheepskin coat and to pay the price difference back to the shepherd between the fancy coat and what a simple one would have cost.
Cloth merchants, fur cap and button-makers
The different by-products of animal skin-processing e.g. horns and bones were utilised by other handicraftsmen such as cloth merchants, the makers of long embroided felt cloaks for Hungarian shepherds, fur caps and hat makers.
In the different price fixing of the time we can come across tailors everywhere, who formed guilds from the early Middle Ages.
Usually, Hungarian tailors visited the different national fairs, shift craftsmen made their products to order and to size, while market craftsmen produced the mass products.
They were first mentioned in a principal order in 1627 which was applied for the whole of Transylvania.
In 1675, article 17 of the regulations of Fülek prohibited bunglers from selling at fairs.
Button maker craftsmen mainly satisfied Hungarian needs and braiding was adopted by other nationalities who also lived in these areas.
The aristocratic and noblemen-ware created a new fashion throughout Europe.
Hungarian clothing became so popular that in 1691 in Vienna a Hungarian button-making guild was founded.
Braiders worked according to German requirements but belonged to joint guilds with Hungarian button makers.
Eisenstadt guild regulations prescribed that Hungarians should produce masterpieces according to the Hungarian fashion, while Germans according to the German.
Blue dyers and rope-makers
Blue dyeing originated from drapery dyeing practised in medieval towns and monasteries; and being a rare profession it did not have an independent guild in this century.
The towns Lõcse, Eperjes, Késmárk and Igló used to have one common co-operative body (1608), the guild of which dealt with the dyeing of linen, broad-cloth and silk.
In the 16-17th centuries, fur cap and hat-makers had a separate guild.
The wearing of fur caps was part of the noble fashion in the 16-17th centuries.
In the following centuries they became a popular item of clothing of the peasantry.
Rope-makers at the time worked as villains or as handicraftsmen on landlords' properties or in the guilds of towns and agricultural towns.
After the Saxon towns of Transylvania, several mining towns of the Upper-Hungarian region founded new guilds in the 16th century.
The unfolding seigniorial domestic economy, mining, long-distance trading and navigation resulted in the increasing demand for economic rope-merchandise.
The making of long and thick mining ropes and hawser particularly required expertise and high quality hemp.
Guilds paid particular attention to buying up good quality hemp, which was purchased by the guild and distributed among its members.
Their independent co-operative body only came into being at the beginning of the 17th century in Transdanubia, in 1628 in Gyõrsziget and in 1631 in Sopron.
House cutters, hoopers and joiners
Since in the 16-17th centuries almost everything was made out of wood in Hungary, professions that involved dealing with wood were flourishing at the time.
By the 16th century carpenters, joiners, cartwrights, turners, wheelwrights and coopers formed their independent guilds.
Hungarian fortresses, castles, country houses and manor buildings were made out of soil and wood.
(Piles were driven into the ground next to each-other and were densely entwined by twigs and fixed by a several layer of grumous mud inside and out.
This was the mud-and-daub wall.)
In such fortresses where the picket-fence was properly formed and the forts were well-tied and raftered while the nicely entwined walls were well-beaten, there was no need to be afraid of the enemy's cannon balls.
The border girders of smoky peasant houses were hewn by the owners themselves, the crossbeam was carved in a similar way, and the walls were entwined by marsh with groves, while the roofs covered with reeds or straw.
Millers who could carve made mills out of oak.
Several reports were found which refer to barrel-maker cartwrights, coopers, bucket and cup-maker villains who performed cartwright activities both in villages and towns.
Charters of property from the 17th century report that the landlord was given 500 wooden dishes and plates from his master craftsmen each year.
In addition, all wooden dish and cupboard-makers, joiners and cartwrights were obliged to make two cupboards or corn-bins for their landlord.
The mementoes of the work of joiners in the agricultural towns and villages are best preserved in those 16-17th century churches, the beamed and wooden coffered, painted ceilings, carved pulpits and benches which had an outstanding effect on the people's decorative art.
Joiner master craftsmen often passed on the profession from father to son.
(Such a dynasty was the Umlings in Transylvania for instance).
The ceiling of the church in Gogánváralja was built between 1503 and 1520, while that of the church of Tancsi constructed in 1676 is the work of János Illyés from Parajd.
Pottery, ceramics
Throughout the 16-17th century the number of guilds consisting of master craftsmen who worked with clay i.e. potters, stove-builders and glaziers was also increasing.
Town potters who mainly worked with a foot wheel and later on changed their profile into making glazed pots worked separately from village potters who still mainly used the hand wheel.
Glaze had already appeared before the Turkish occupation on the green and yellow stoves of palatials.
(The making of stoves was not distinct from pottery work since stove tiles and the various pots were made in the same workshops).
The green and yellow glazed pitchers and dishes were already used as early as the 15th century.
Later on the larger wine pitchers and certain dishes of village communities', guilds' and reformed churches' were also glazed.
The name of the customer, the list of names of the magistracy of guilds and often the pottery maker's name as well as the year of production was painted on this pottery.
The earliest ones are known from the 17th century.
During the Turkish occupation the glazed dish with various fancy-work appeared.
The most common decorative motives were flowers, birds, stags, horses and the human figures they used
The colour-glazed, geometrically patterned so-called combed style was also considered to be a Turkish decorative motive.
(The more elaborate work was prepared by a comb-type of tool.)
Dishes were not only used at the table, but they decorated the walls of kitchens and bedrooms.
Dishes of the "schoolmaster's house" in Pásztó, which were hidden in 1551 provide a strong indication of the former popularity of glazed and decorated dishes.
Mementoes of dish making from the era of the Turkish occupation mostly originate from around the central area of the river Tisza, in Miskolc, Debrecen (where a guild was established in 1570), in Mezõcsát and in Tiszafüred.
(In the two towns mentioned last the style of ceramics from the Turkish occupation still exists).
In Transylvania the Saxon and Transylvanian potters also formed guilds at an early stage.
The Hungarian-language charter of the potters of Dés came into being between 1504 and 1532.
In Kolozsvár the appearance of a potter guild can be traced to 1512.
The most characteristic feature of the Transylvanian pottery was pot making.
Pots and glazed water-cans were mainly cobalt blue.
The introduction of tin-glazed ceramics (faience) in Hungary is linked to the movements of the Habáns and their settlement in the country.
The secret of making tin-glazed white pots was only known to the potters in Hungary.
By granting them safe conduct and privileges, Gábor Bethlen settled the Habáns in Alvinc, which is located near Gyulafehérvár in Transylvania (1621-1623).
The economic records of Anna Bornemissza consort of the reigning prince listed all those "bogally dishes" which were delivered to them by new Christians as New Year presents in 1688: mugs, cups, white and blue pitchers, jugs, glasses and salt-pots.
In Sárospatak, prince György Rákóczi I. settled the Habáns among whom were tile-making potters.
In noble courts in the 14-15th century stoves were built using high quality artistic glazed tiles.
Throughout the 15th century stove building also appeared in the smaller rural and agricultural town workshops.
Habáns who settled in Upper Northern Hungary, in Transylvania and in several parts of Transdanubia had a great influence on the works of potters of town guilds and villages.
In the 16th century stove-furnaces appeared in the villages too and at the same time the stove-eye making village centres were also formed.
Turkish handcraftsmanship
When examining the appearance of Turkish-Ottoman handcraftsmanship in Hungary, we must take the differences among the central territory under Turkish rule, Transylvania and royal Hungary into consideration.
In the last two mentioned areas particularly in the Transylvanian principal court but also among the noble families in the western part of the country, Turkish influence - often directly from Constantinople - dominated, and manifested itself in the spectacular use of Turkish luxury goods.
The Turkish-Islamic fashion that was drifting towards Western Europe had also started to mainly effect these areas from the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century on.
Due to the settling Turkish traders and handicraftsmen, new branches of industry were introduced which complied with and served the lifestyle of Muslims.
Surviving objects and archaeological excavations have revealed that southern-Slavic people who arrived from the Balkans also had an influence on Hungarian culture which naturally contained elements of the Ottoman civilisation.
Turkish pottery
The arrival of the Turkish conquerors and the settling of groups of southern-Slav ethnic origin resulted in the appearance of new ceramics types which had hitherto been unknown in Hungary and had therefore been sharply distinct from the products of the former Hungarian ceramics.
The new types of dishes indicate a different eating culture and habits.
According to Turkish customs registries from the time, different objects which were intended to satisfy the needs of the Muslim inhabitants arrived in the country through established trading on a large scale. However, the large number of unfinished and faulty relics as well as the remains of a Turkish pottery furnace that were dug up on the Esztergom-Saint Thomas hill indicate that Turkish soldiers were also followed by master handicraftsmen, which means that some of the ceramics were made locally.
The most typical products of Turkish pottery were the thickly glazed stemmed dishes and cups designed for liquid food, soups and vegetable dishes and were used by Turks who ate crouching down at tiny dining tables.
The Turks also spread the use of jugs with handles and pouring spouts.
As well as the more simple objects that were designed for everyday use, luxury items of oriental origin such as the fine porcelain dishes and cups from distant China or the Chinese green glazed seladon-dishes also appeared in Hungary through the mediation of wealthier Turks.
Products from the two outstanding centres of Turkish ceramics production: the Europe-wide famous and popular ceramics of Iznik and later the faience dishes of Kütahja also reached the occupied areas of the country.
Corresponding to the Turkish tradition which valued Chinese porcelain more than the products of Iznik, Hungarian archaeological excavations have also revealed a larger number of Chinese porcelain cups than faience dishes from Iznik.
The most beautiful products of the Iznik ceramics production - which were the multi-coloured glazed wall tiles, - were not used in Hungary by Turkish architects.
However, Gábor Bethlen prince of Transylvania and later - following his predecessor's example -György Rákóczi I. did actually order wall tiles for the palaces of Sárospatak, Gyalu, Gyulafehérvár and Fogaras, even though they did not originate from Iznik but from Constantinople.
Such pieces are preserved in the so called "bokályos house" of Sárospatak castle which is the room of the Red Tower decorated with Turkish wall tiles.
Turkish metal works
With few exceptions, Turkish tradesmen were the representatives of such basic branches of industry, which satisfied people's everyday needs.
One of the rare exceptions was the silver and goldsmith trade, the craftsmen of which had already appeared in Hungary by the second half of the 16th century.
Little has reached us of their work and what there is can mainly be found in the private collections of noblemen. These valuable metal objects were rarely buried in the ground unless they were hidden deliberately, which was the case for silver cups that have been excavated in large numbers.
One of the typical examples of new branches of industry that served the settling Turkish inhabitants was the brazier.
The rich copper mines of Anatoly provided plenty of raw materials for the easily workable and transportable brass objects.
However, works of Turkish braziers did not only reach the occupied areas through trading.
There are several pieces of evidence to prove that such objects were also made locally.
For instance we have knowledge of the fact that the Turkish coppersmiths settled in a separate street in the Buda castle which is the area of today's Trinity (Szentháromság) street.
Turkish carpets
Based on the techniques of carpet making we can distinguish between two fundamental types of Turkish carpets: the woven and knotted carpets.
Mainly knotted carpets were imported to the Hungarian territories.
There is ample evidence from the end of the 15th century verifying that Turkish carpets were brought on a large scale into Transylvania through trading, and in smaller quantities through direct purchase from Constantinople.
Even almost up to the present day Turkish prayer mats remained in such large quantities in Transylvanian Protestant churches, that the type they preserved - which is the so called "double confessional" - is referred to as the "Transylvanian carpet" all over the world.
The actual place of production of these carpets was the town of Usak in Western-Anatoly.
Based on the legacy of Hungarian agricultural towns and estates it seems that people who lived in the occupied areas either never or hardly used Turkish carpets in their households.
Naturally, Turks who settled in these territories did transport and use their own carpets.
The woven kilims, the knotted halis and the prayer mats called szedzsade can all be traced to a Turkish origin.
Turkish textile industry and embroidery
Throughout the Turkish occupation and in fact prior to it, Turkish textiles flooded into the country.
The Turkish laundry, the so-called bagazia linen and the most important basic material of peasant-ware the aba-felt became widely known across the divided country.
Taking up the products of the Turkish textile industry did not result in any change in Hungarian dress, although certain articles were undoubtedly spread by Turkish influence.
In women's fashion it was the kürdi, which was a sleeveless waistcoat, and in men's wear the dolman and the so-called salvar-trousers became popular.
Although one of the most characteristic Turkish items of clothing - the caftan - was brought into Hungary on a large scale, it did not became part of Hungarian men's wear.
This theory is supported by several references which mention the alteration and cutting up of caftans.
Turkish embroidery favoured all over Europe also became popular among the Hungarian nobility.
From the end of the 16th century onwards, the number of pillowcases, sheets, and bodices that were decorated by Turkish embroidery increased in the trousseau of baronial and noble families' daughters.
It was usually Turkish seamstresses who made these embroideries.
EDUCATION
Schools
Education in Hungary in the Renaissance and Baroque era took place within the traditional framework that was established in the Middle Ages and antiquity.
Looking at this from a modern perspective, the progress appears to be rather slow.
Schools were still operating within or under the supervision of the churches, and the learning of the Latin language played just as an important role in the 18th century as it did at the end of the medieval era.
Such a thing as compulsory school attendance did not exist, and education did not exclusively imply attending a school.
Private tutors who were employed by the baronial courts primarily educated the nobility.
There was no significant demand for educating females, and for a long time young girls were only dealt with in the countryside manor houses of enthusiastic noble ladies. Here they did embroidery (often while listening to music), observed the clever tricks of housekeeping and sometimes learned to write.
The development of the education system was slow, yet it was a continuous and unstoppable process even though this only seemed to effect the seemingly insignificant details.
These small moves were nevertheless steps towards the establishment of a more modern organisational framework of education.
In addition to village and town churches, the usual three-year elementary education was carried out in the so called lower grade schools at the beginning of the 16th century.
Primary school students were taught basic religious studies while at the same time they were given the opportunity to become familiar with Latin and Hungarian reading and writing.
Students who continued their education in the secondary grammar schools of town schools, studied the two subjects of the classical trivium for another four years one of which was Latin grammar including syntax, prosody and poetry, and the other was the examination of rhetoric in ancient texts.
Education in most domestic schools had come to a halt here, students who wished to be engrossed in logic (dialectics in other words) and in Aristotle's philosophy, only had the opportunity for further study in the highest standard college-type of institutions for another three years.
Every significant Church had established their own college education system.
The most significant ones were the Calvinist colleges (in the towns of Debrecen, Sárospatak, Pápa, Nagyvárad, Gyulafehérvár, Marosvásárhely, and later Nagyenyed).
The Catholic Church which revived after the Trentine Council tried to realise its college education in Jesuits colleges in accordance with a unified and modern syllabus the Ratio Studiorum (in Nagyszombat, and in Kolozsvár).
Lutherans ran their excellent college in Eperjes while the Transylvanian Unitarian Church had its famous college in Kolozsvár.
Hungary did not have a university for a long time, therefore deserving and talented students were sent abroad by their parents and patrons.
Hungarian students could only study theology, law and medical sciences at an academic level in the universities of Italy, Poland and Germany. At a later stage Holland and England, were also places where they could do their Phds.
These facts should not lead us to conclude that natural sciences were entirely absent in Hungary.
Hungarian humanists had excellent mathematical, astronomical, medical and medical-botanical knowledge at their disposal, and from the second half of the 16th century natural science literature was also produced in Hungarian.
Both the Hoffhalter-printers of Debrecen and the Heltai-workshop in Kolozsvár used to publish popular maths textbooks (1577, 1591).
The medical herbal book written by Péter Juhász Melius entitled Herbarium was republished several times throughout the 16th century, while János Vitus Balsaráti - a medical doctor - wrote a surgical work in Hungarian which unfortunately was later lost.
A comprehensive medical work written by György Lencsés has survived in the form of a manuscript.
Following the failed attempts of medieval Hungarian kings, Transylvanian princes likewise tried to establish the right conditions for university education in Hungary.
It was Zsigmond János who first tried to establish an Anti-trinity spirited university at the end of the 1560's in Gyulafehérvár, although his attempts never got past the planning stage.
Later, István Báthory the prince of Transylvania and king of Poland established a successful Jesuit educational institution in Kolozsvár, which qualified its students for an academic theological occupation, but which later had to close down due to the pressure imposed by Protestant orders.
Under the reign of Zsigmond Báthory the college was re-opened (1594), but soon after public anger against Jesuits swept away the institution for good. In 1603 it was levelled to the ground.
The first university - which is still open today and the predecessor of Loránd Eötvös Scientific University - was founded in Nagyszombat by Péter Pázmány archbishop of Esztergom in 1635.
This Jesuit educational institution could compete with other similar, medium standard universities of Central Europe.
In the first few years the school did not have medical and law faculties, therefore the Pope did not acknowledge it as a university.
Pázmány therefore re-established the institution with the approval of king Ferdinand II.
At the beginning it ran five philosophical and seven theological departments.
The law faculty was established in 1667 with four departments.
The institution had its own printers - the predecessor of the University Publishers - who printed textbooks and teaching aid materials of ever increasing quality.
The curriculum
From the beginning of the 16th century schools as well as churches became avenues for religious conflict in Hungary, which was a country divided by the different denominations.
Despite this, Protestant and Catholic schools were only different from each other in regard to their world concept and organisation, but in their school timetables and curriculum they were fundamentally the same.
The difference between the new Catholic schools established by the Jesuits and those of the Protestant institutions was that the Jesuits ran separate lower grade school sections in the mother-tongue for those who did not wish to further their studies.
The most important aim of education for both Protestant and Catholic schools was the ecclesiastical tuition, however, demand had also increased for educating secular intellectuals.
From the end of the 16th century onwards there were also schools for nobles where mainly future field officers of border fortresses were educated.
Public and general education, as well as the tuition of women was in its initial stage at the time, though from the middle of the 16th century mother-tongue education was widespread among the general public (town citizenry, traders, wealthier farmers) and women: who became the readers of the popular literary works which were published in ever greater numbers.
Hungary was no exception to feeling the effects of the great reforms of syllabuses in the Renaissance and Baroque era.
The forging ahead of humanism all over Europe had laid a foundation of the trivium, which meant that the predominance of linguistic and literary achievement was favoured over the quadrivium on which medieval scholasticism placed the greater emphasis.
This process created a favourable environment for those Hungarian schools where only subjects of the trivium were taught.
School reform by the Humanists in the 16th century placed its emphasis on the attainment of the studia humanitatis and a quality education in Latin, Greek and Hebrew.
At the Protestant secondary grammar schools in Sárospatak, Debrecen, Tolna, Kolozsvár and Marosvásárhely, the teaching of humanitarian subjects took place based on the popular textbooks of Wittenberg written by Philipp Melanchton.
The humanist reform was also carried out in the Catholic school of Nagyszombat, which was revived by Miklós Oláh.
This excellent prelate united the two schools of Nagyszombat, the one of the town and of the chapter, and raised the new institution to college level.
He extended the basic section of the school which bestowed humanitarian qualifications with another section, where Latin and Greek philology was taught in a Catholic spirit: Miklós Oláh also collected and burnt the text-books written by the Protestant Philipp Melanchton.
Representatives of Puritanism initiated the second, highly significant domestic educational reform, which was a reform trend within Calvinism.
After returning from England and Germany, János Dali Tolnai planned to implement radical changes in the education in Sárospatak.
He was a Puritan reformer, who in opposition to Melanchthon's pedagogical theories - which at the time were decisive within the Orthodox Calvinist pedagogy - recommended the doctrines of a 16th century French philosopher and pedagogical thinker Petrus Ramus.
Ramus applied a unified and practical logical way of thinking which was free from the stiff Aristotelian scholastic ideas, and instead focused on the cognition of reality. Hungarian Puritans placed the aforementioned practical logic at the centre of their tuition, which further provoked the indignation of their orthodox adversaries.
Teachers
The competence of tutors - at the time addressed as masters, rectors or ludimagisters - who taught in Hungarian schools in the 16-17th centuries varied greatly.
The meagre education and poor Latin of pastors and teachers was often striking for foreign travellers who visited towns in the countryside.
Both Protestant preachers and Catholic prelates constantly beset the rulers, baronial and town magistrates who ran the schools not to stop supporting education.
The raising of the standard of Hungarian schools which was so strongly desired, actually depended on whether the schools could afford to invite Europe-wide famous foreign lecturers.
Most colleges could thank their success to these highly educated tutors.
There were many good Hungarian teachers, too: Gergely Molnár, Péter Károlyi, Balázs Fabricius Szikszai.
At the school of Nagyszombat, one of the greatest philologists of the era Nicasius Ellebodius taught the Greek language.
Zsigmond János tried to invite Petrus Ramus himself to the foundation of the university of Gyulafehérvár.
Teachers of the Unitarian College of Kolozsvár came out from among the followers of the radical Reformation who were prosecuted all over Europe.
Not only did they influence the cultural life of Transylvania in religious matters but at the same time they made the modern literary and art trends popular.
The fact that the Italian renaissance saw its second resurgence in 16-17th century Transylvania, was partly due to their work.
Hungarian students in 1622 had the chance to meet one of the most famous German poets and authors of science literature Martin Opitz, who was invited to the Reformed College of Gyulafehérvár by Gábor Bethlen.
Scientific literature and textbooks written by famous German professors who fled to Gyulafehérvár to escape the devastation of the Thirty Years War such as Johann Heinrich Bisterfeld, Johann Heinrich Alsted and Ludwig Philipp Piscator, had a permanent influence on Hungarian cultural life.
The Puritan reformers invited the most famous tutor of the era: Johannes Amos Comenius to Sárospatak, where he attempted to establish the "pansophistic school" something he had always dreamed about.
Between 1650 and 1654 Comenius was a driving force behind the success of the college of Sárospatak, even though his way of reviving Hungarian and universal pedagogy was not only through creating a new curriculum but rather through the highly effective, humorous and clear textbooks which he wrote.
The Orbis Pictus, which was one of his multi-language textbooks illustrated by figures, was written in Sárospatak.
However, even Comenius was eclipsed by a new educational programme created by the greatest Hungarian tutor János Csere Apáczai.
Apáczai attempted to compile all the knowledge available into a comprehensive system based on Cartesianism, which was the philosophy of Descartes.
He tried to re-plant his principles and works he wrote throughout his visit to Western-Europe into the teaching practice in Hungary.
His speech on the great need for schools and the reasons for the barbaric situation in Hungary - which he gave from the headmaster's chair in the newly built College of Kolozsvár in 1656 - was a brief summary of his educational ideas.
From the beginning of the 16th century, Hungarian book printers regarded the supplying of schools with textbooks as their responsibility.
Honterus, Heltai and other printers of the 16th century published well-proven textbooks of good repute and their revised versions for local needs over and over again.
Later, in the 17th century - under the influence of the famous pedagogical thinkers - the modern grammatical, poetical, rhetorical and logical works written by Hungarian authors were issued one after another.
The rhetorical books of Pál Medgyesi, György Tóth Martonfalvi, Márton Tönkõ Szilágyi or Mihály Buzinkai were written for both teachers and students of the domestic protestant schools: these works played a significant role in the development of a Hungarian literary way of thinking.
Comenius and Apáczai were outstanding intellectuals, however, their work unfortunately did not characterise the standard of Hungarian pedagogy as a whole.
Conservatism and views that rejected any kind of reform caused them and their followers much bitterness.
As a result of this pressure, the development of education was a very slow and self-contradictory process.
EVERYDAY LIFE
Family life
The interpretation of the word: family fundamentally differed from the one of today, since in this era as well as several generations of parents and children of baronial and noble families it also included the immediate servants and other serving staff.
Noble people including both women and men were hardly ever alone, since they were accompanied by servants at almost every turn. This made the forming of intimate friendships extremely difficult, not to mentioning when a man tried to court to a woman face to face.
Nobles, wealthier citizens and in fact the richer peasants slept in the same bedroom with their servants, even when an intimate relationship took place between the married couples.
But even ordinary peasants could not be alone, since a farm could not be run by one person, therefore several adult brothers lived in the same household "on one loaf" - as written in contemporaneous sources.
This was only an advantage when the state direct tax was collected from the houses regardless of the number of tenants.
In addition to family members often with complicated relationships to each other, cotters, servants and many other serving staff carried out the work in the manors.
Couples in this era were most often brought together according to decisions and agreements between their parents and other relatives.
In baronial circles where marriages were based on the interests of wealth and societal position, love marriages rarely came into being.
It was more common however, that married couples experienced true love with each other afterwards. At the beginning of the 17th century, György Thurzó wrote to his wife: "In vain did I seek a more beautiful maid than thyself amongst the maids of Pozsony, and this was so for only thou art the one for me".
Noble men of the time who often fought in battles far from their families exchanged passionate letters with their wives, the most famous series of which is perhaps the correspondence between Tamás Nádasdy palatine and Orsolya Kanizsai from the second half of the 16th century.
The exchange of rings was a common custom, and the ring had to be studded with a precious stone.
Town citizens and peasants of agricultural towns and villages only exchanged handkerchiefs and fancy shawls at their engagement ceremonies, after which stepping back from the intention of marriage was considered to be shameful.
It appears that from the early post-medieval period close relationships and emotional ties played an increasingly important role in marriages.
Standard of living in contemporaneous Hungary
The price revolution in the 16th century in Europe often resulted in price rises in grain crops and other foodstuffs.
As a result of huge price increases, huge famines were triggered in the West, where the majority of people had to survive on less food of poorer quality.
In considering the standard of living, we can pinpoint two fundamental differences: The price increases in Hungary were somewhat smaller than in Western Europe, and thanks to large scale domestic cattle rearing, meat consumption did not fall as drastically as in the West.
Nor were the overall effects of famine in Hungary so devastating since the country still had a large number of independent self-producing farms, and even the town citizenry had small areas of cultivatable land and vineyards at their disposal.
However, the serfs of Transylvania were a lot poorer, since the poorer quality of the soil of the hilly and mountainous landscape produced fewer crops.
Serf households that had little reserves often experienced a crisis in times of war, bad harvests or natural catastrophes.
According to one description, in the county of Hunyad in 1603 famine was so severe, that people ate the soles of sandals, the skin of saddles, tree barks, and bone meals, and roasted the bodies of those who died.
Luxury items
In the 17th century, town regulations against luxury increased in Hungary.
Péter Bornemisza attacked the kind of luxury, which had spread amongst the nobility in the 16th century, who tried to imitate the clothing of the aristocracy.
Later, even poor servant girls and other servants tried to imitate the fashion and manners of the wealthier town citizens which rather upset the distinguished ladies and gentlemen.
In Sopron, Kassa and other larger towns serious decrees were brought into force which emphasised that everyone should wear clothes in accordance with their social ranks.
These phenomena can mainly be explained by the fact that the value of goods were re-arranged in the 17th century and new prices made the purchase of various luxury items possible for a wider range of people.
Such goods, the price of which had by this time become affordable for the different classes, were mainly the products of Western and Central European industries where people worked at a more advanced stage in the division of labour.
Eating habits
People in Hungary in the 16-17th centuries consumed a lot more meat than the inhabitants of Western Europe.
This was primarily due to the large scale of cattle rearing.
As well as beef, people ate mutton, pork, poultry and fish.
The making of game dishes (rabbit, deer, stag) and small birds (quail, partridge, snipe, black grouse) flavoured by different sauces was also common.
Meat was most often cooked or baked together with cabbage, since this was the most popular vegetable both for the nobility and the poorer classes.
Cabbage, which was regarded as the queen of Hungarian gardens, was preserved for winter as an uncut vegetable, or grated and flavoured by dill, salt and horseradish.
It was considered as a tasty and particularly healthy food.
People of the era enjoyed the different kinds of fish too, sources most commonly refer to pike, isinglass-fish, rock-cod, sturgeon, horned pout, loach and eel - which were mainly consumed during Lent and served with a sauce including cabbage, white pepper, lemon and sour cream.
Pork was a lot more expensive than the plentiful beef, which made even bacon a costly food.
Pigs were kept everywhere around the manors, and even town people used to fatten one or two for their own consumption.
Crabs and snails were also part of the diet.
There was less consumption of milk and dairy-products in Hungary than in other Western countries.
Cheese was usually served after the five-six courses of feasts, together with other dishes prepared by curd-cheese and sour cream.
Butter and cheese were usually home-made, since cows and sheep were kept everywhere.
The consumption of dairy products was more common among ethnic Romanians in Transylvania and in the Upper Hungarian region, who particularly dealt with sheep rearing.
The poor quality and disease-spreading effect of the waters was well-known at the time, prompting people to prefer to drink wine or beer which became popular under the influence of the German burghers.
Spices and fruit
The "spice craze" which swept across Europe in the 16-17th centuries reached Hungary, too.
The most valuable and most popular spice was the pepper, which arrived in the country at the beginning of the 16th century via the Levantine route through Transylvania but later became obtainable through a roundabout way via Wallachia or Kassa, or from the West.
Crocus and ginger grew domestically, but the equally popular clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and lemon found their way to Hungary from abroad.
Vegetables for home consumption were cultivated in every small garden and manor, hence people were familiar with peas, beans, parsley, spinage, pumpkin, cucumber and even with cauliflower and asparagus.
In 1588, in the garden of a famous nobleman of Transdanubia called Boldizsár Batthyány even potatoes were grown.
A description of tobacco has also survived from 1577, and was included among the plants of a garden in Németújvár, which belonged to the Batthyánys.
Even an account in Hungarian written by Miklós Oláh mentions Hungary's richness in fruit.
The mostly widespread types of fruit were apple, pear, plum, cherry, apricot and peach.
In baronial gardens it was a fashion to collect extraordinary fruit and ornamental trees as well as other exotic plants, this is how the first species of horse-chestnut, lilac and tulips were introduced into Hungary.
Clothing
The period of 16-17th century was the era when the typical |Hungarian fashion was formed.
Men wore the dolman with varying sleeve-lengths, which was tight down to the waist and loosened from there. On the top of the dolman they wore a short fur-lined coat which was either the type gradually loosened from the shoulders or only loosened from the waist downwards.
These items were decorated with embroideries, laces and fancy buttons and worn with shirts, tight fitting so called "Hungarian-style" trousers and hard legged boots or a pair of leather sandals.
A fur-hat and a gown completed this outfit.
Naturally, aristocratic men wore the type of clothes that were made of finer and more expensive material (velvet, scarlet, satin) and decorated with fur (pine martin, lynx, fox) as well as an overgarment which was either padded, or decorated with golden buttons.
Shirts underneath them were embroidered with white silk, or the more valuable ones with golden or silver yarns.
The characteristic features of Hungarian women's wear had formed by the 16th century.
These included the skirt, stays, bodice, apron, pelisse and gown.
In the cases of both women and men the varying length wide sheepskin-coat was part of the overgarment.
Distinguished ladies wore clothes made of quality, fine fabric as opposed to the woollen fabric the broadcloth, which was considered as peasant-ware.
By the beginning of the 17th century, a wide variety of colours and types of textile were in fashion, the most valuable of which were the different types of silk, but the velvet and satin were also regarded as exclusive.
On the cost of any of the dresses that were made out of the aforementioned material, a town house or smaller manor could have been bought.
The value of the dresses were mostly indicated by their golden and silk embroidery, golden buttons and twines as well as expensive laces which were all part of the decoration.
Different types of fur were also used either as decorations, or padding.
In embroidery, Turkish patterns became fashionable (i.e. the use of the carnation-pattern), and most commonly lingerie was embroidered with white, and bodices with red or blue threads.
In peasant clothing the broadcloth, and more simple linen and shirting were widespread, and naturally, even these clothing articles were richly decorated with embroidery.
Life near the boundaries: raiding, and ambushing
In earlier times, the two great powers lived in peace with each-other, therefore the army of the border areas were strictly prohibited from disrupting peace and harassing one-another's territories.
However, this prohibition had little effect.
The regular practise of not paying soldiers, their poor supply and the desire for fame forced the soldiers of both sides to provide for themselves by capturing people and animals and plundering properties.
Battles immediately started after winter and only stopped in the period of so-called grazing (during spring-early summer), harvesting and heat waves.
At the time, raiding was considered as fieldwork and troops setting off for raiding or ambushing were the combatants.
The combatants always began their work at night, under the command of the combatant-leaders.
Before them, guards and track reconnaissance made sure of the safety of the terrain and they were followed by rear guards led by lagmen.
The area chosen for ambushing was the lurking place (usually by the side of roads), where the majority of the raiders - the brigades - moved into position.
When the sentry gave the signal, they let out the booty (a maximum of 15-20 men on horseback), who led the enemy troops into the ambush and who were then attacked, captured and robbed.
Each opposing side was well aware of the other's tricks (ambushing and re-ambushing, the use of disguises etc.) and often they even managed to spy on and learn of one-another s intentions which often meant that these adventures ended in tragedy.
Spying and intelligence work in the Turkish era
Accurate and timely information for the supreme command in Vienna and for Hungarian captain generals on the enemy's plans was a fundamental necessity in order to succeed against the Turks.
To bring this into realisation, by the second half of the 16th century the Christian management of war organised a multi-level intelligence-work system.
On the Sultan's plans, Habsburg-envoys (diplomatic spying) - who were stationed at the court of the Sultan - provided accounts on, who obtained information from the Serb, Bosnian, Hungarian or German officials of the Sultan, from interpreters with great influence, from the Sultan's Jewish doctors, from the diplomats of other states and from separately paid "secret agents or correspondents".
News for the Hungarian border-fortress soldiers about the intentions of Turkish troops stationed on the borders were given by the Hungarian scriveners of pashas and beys, the magistrates and serfs of the occupied villages - who had free admission to Turkish houses near the borders when delivering taxes, - by Christian prisoners who were released to collect their ransom, captured Turkish soldiers the so called "tongues", and last but not least by Hungarian, Raguzan and Greek merchants.
The Turks, - who apart from diplomatic spying did not establish permanent embassies - attempted to spy on their Christian enemy in a similar way.
Hostage-trading alongside the Turkish-Hungarian border
Contrary to public belief, the Turks who settled in Hungary never drove thousands of people out of the country.
At the same time, in the 16-17th century a separate tradition was formed for the trading of hostages for ransom.
In addition to the irregular soldier's pay, the income derived from such activities became an important source for the armies of both sides.
Hostages captured in raids were divided by the Hungarian and Turkish border fortress soldiers at auctions, and were then bid for and sold.
Following this procedure, hostages "made deals" about the ransom they had to pay with their owners throughout a lengthy period of bargaining which often culminated in a beating.
Fellow hostages had to undertake to guarantee the return of those who were released to collect their ransom, which meant that they gave their ears, noses and teeth as warrants, or under duress money was offered by the wealthier agricultural towns under occupation.
The collection of a ransom often took years throughout which hostages sometimes went as far as the German Empire on their begging journeys.
At the same time, released hostages were protected by several unwritten laws (for example it was forbidden to beat them, and they had to be transported on carts) and their interests were represented by one of their more experienced fellow hostages.
To authenticate the various documents in connection with the collection of a ransom, hostages even had their own seal.
Turkish-Hungarian single combat
Apart from raids on the enemy's territory, soldiers of border fortresses who were facing each other often fought with one-another in single combats (duellum).
Similarly to hostage trading for ransom, a new tradition was also formed in single combat.
A more distinguished Christian or Turkish higher officer often called the opposition parties to carry out single combats.
The initiating party usually announced the combat's cause, named its venue, time and method (by pike, broad-sword, sword, etc.), in fact, he often provoked the opponent by offensive words so that he could not refuse the single combat.
Although the carrying out of tournaments was strictly prohibited in peacetime, in reality single combats were quite regular occurrences.
After the opponents agreed on the combat, they issued a charter for each other in which they guaranteed not to set up traps.
It also included the number of accompanying armed men and the circumstances of the execution of the single combat.
After all this, the two opponents fought on the indicated date on a larger field in front of several hundred soldiers with the help of seconds.
The best duellists (György Thury, László Gyulaffy or Bálint Magyar for example) occasionally fought with several Turkish opponents one after another.
Turkish houses and homes
Houses in towns occupied by the Turks soon underwent a strange conversion: windows of their lower floors were sealed up by planks.
This was the protection of Muslim families from curious glances from the outside world.
Conversion took place inside the houses too: larger rooms were divided into lots of small premises by partitions which not only allowed the families to live separately from each other, but within the families males and females had their own space. (that of the men's was called szelamli, and that the women harem).
Those who moved into smaller houses left everything untouched.
Simple soldiers, who had not been allotted space in the formerly Hungarian houses, built themselves primitive shelters out of hedgerow and clay.
Inside Turkish houses there was hardly any furniture but plenty of textile.
Their clothes were kept in large boxes or large bundles.
They sat and slept on cushions, mattresses, carpets and homespun.
Against cold, they used a metal dish with glowing embers.
Their kitchenware consisted of simple clay and metal pots.
Larger, fancy furniture, valuable weapons and horse equipment, expensive textiles, toiletries, significant food stocks but especially books were only present in the houses of wealthier Turks.
Turkish food, drinks, coffee and cafes
Turks very much favoured various vegetables stuffed with meat, herbs and other vegetables, and meat roasted on a stick or a grill (especially lamb), but soldiers - who formed the majority of the inhabitants - mostly ate fruit and cheap soups (the csorba) which were cooked commonly in large pots.
Soldiers setting off for battles took dried and smoked meat, honey, small gnocchi and dried bread.
In more peaceful times confectionery items made with honey were extremely popular, likewise sherbet which was diluted with fruit juices, must or the stingy fermented elder.
Coffee was "discovered" sometime in the middle of the 15th century in Yemen, and by the beginning of the 16th century, - together with the cafes established in the meantime- was widespread almost all over the Near East.
In the Ottoman capital the first cafes opened by the middle of the century, and although their operation did not please the authorities, they soon began their conquest in the Balkans and Central Europe.
A merchant called Behram first brought coffee beans to Hungary at the end of 1579 and from this point onwards the "black soup" was drunk here, too.
While Hungarian society (within which the higher classes primarily) only got into the habit of drinking coffee after the occupation ended, Turks of all ranks liked coffee, and town people (except women) if they were given the chance, mostly preferred to spend their free time in cafes with a companion.
