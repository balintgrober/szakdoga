Introduction
The eating habits and rites of an ethnic group are deeply inherent in its ethnography and culture.
What is known as “Hungarian cuisine” is only a thin slice of the 1100-old-history of the Hungarians.
As our ancestors already pointed out: “we are what we eat”.
Since the pagan, nomad tribes ate meat they creed under the saddle, the life of the Hungarians living in the Carpathian-basin has been greatly influenced by foreign cultures.
What’s more, we should not think that until the surrounding world ceases to have impact on us, our dishes which fill us with pride and are full of passion, will wait and remain unchanged.
Because our sons and grandsons will not savour the same taste, as we can’t savour the simple but harmonious, tranquillizing taste of the shepherd slambuc of our grandfathers.
This is exactly the reason why we, innkeepers, must treat with the highest respect the extraordinarily rich gastro-culture that we inherited from our ancestors.
And, dear guest, all you have to do is sit among us and we will put everything our ascendants cherished with so much care in front of you.
Jókai bean soup as Aunt Róza made it
Mór Jókai (1825-1904), writer
Jókai liked the “full” meals with a strong character, so it is not surprising that he pleased Hungarians with his dense bean soup with pig nails.
The varieties made from shank, sausage and small pieces of paste are all new versions, as “Aunt Róza made it”.
Ingredients:
• 60 dkg of smoked shank of pork
• 3 pairs of debreceni (sausage)
• 20 dkg of dry beans
• 10 dkg of carrots
• 10 dkg of turnips
• 5 dkg of celery
• 6 dkg of flour
• 3 dkg of red onion
• 1-2 cloves of garlic
• 2 dl of sour cream
• lard
• sweet seasoning paprika (Kalocsai)
• salt, ground pepper
• csipetke (small pieces of paste)
Put the prepared beans with the shank into 2-2, 5 litres of water to boil.
Add the cleaned, whole carrots, turnips, the celery and the sausage and cook them slowly until they get soft.
Take everything, except for the beans, out of the water: put the vegetables aside, turn the bone out of the shank, then dice its meat and slice the sausage.
Take the “debrecenis” out of the water when they are almost soft, cut them into halves lengthwise, cut them in at close distances, fry them crackling on the lard and add them to the soup only right before serving.
In the meantime, make a beige-coloured roux on little lard, with the fine-cut red onion, the fine-grated garlic and a little red paprika,  thickening the soup with it.
(Add some salt if necessary.)
Put the shank and the sausage back into the gravy, boil it and put small pieces of paste into it.
If the paste is tender enough, serve it with sour cream.
Falusi chicken-soup, á la Ede Újházy
Ede Újházy (1844-1915), actor
During his visits Ede Újházy gave accounts of his liking for soups stewed from pieces of ripe chicken, giblets, paste and some suitable fruit.
The next day the chef pleased him with the first version of the later chicken soup.
The Master tasted it, then gave further instructions as to how to make it.
So was made the version of the chicken soup which has always been present on the menu of the most famous restaurants.
“A plateful of this soup helps the sick get better and makes the healthy vigorous and young.”
Ingredients:
• 1 bigger chicken
• 50 dkg of carrots
• 20 dkg of turnips
• 15 dkg of celery
• 1 bigger red onion
• 15 dkg of mushrooms
• 20 dkg of green peas
• 3 dkg of tomato pulp
• 1 bunch of parsley
• salt, whole pepper
• vermicelli (very thin noodles)
Put the trimmed chicken to boil in so much water that it well covers it.
When it boils, remove the foam from the surface of the water.
Salt it, add some peas, the peeled red onion, the celery, the tomato pulp, the carrots and the turnips, then cook it on a slow fire until  the meat and the vegetables get tender.
In the meantime, cook the rest of the peas soft in a little soup.
Cook the noodles in salted water, strain them and put them aside.
If the chicken is tender, take it out from the water and cut it into  pieces (remove the skin and the bigger bones).
In the meantime, take the soup off the fire to let it settle.
Put the pieces of meat in a soup-bowl, add the cooked vegetables (cut them into thin pieces before), the mushrooms (cut them into pieces before) and the peas. Remove the fat from the top of the soup and strain the hot liquid on the meat, vegetables and noodles.
In the end, scatter it with fine-cut parsley.
Cat-fish soup á la Molnárné from Szeged, made in stew-pot
The version á la Molnárné has long-lasting traditions.
Originally, it was made by the water-millers.
That is to say, the water millers, beyond the normal wage, had to give a plate of meal to the workers, the young mill-hands who had very good appetite.
The fish and the flour were given.
The simplest thing to do was cook the kneaded paste in the fish-soup.
It has become a famous specialty of Kalocsa, Paks and Baja.
Based on a recipe from 1890.
Ingredients:
• 3 kg of fish (carp and other species too if possible)
• 3 kg of red onions
• 9-10 spoons of seasoning paprika
• 1-2 peppers
• 1-3 cherry-peppers
• 1 tomato
• 1 clove of garlic
• paste
Pour 1-2 fingers of salted water in a stew-pot, put the fish (cut into pieces) in it, but do not fill the stew-pot completely, leave at least a two-finger-space for the boiling, pour water on it until it covers the fish and put it on fire.
If some foam appears during the cooking, put some red onion rings on  top and some spoonfuls of home-made cherry-pepper on the foam, and shaking the pot a bit we can prevent it from burning.
Taste it while it boils and, if it is necessary, add some salt and paprika.
If the soup is cooked, put big pieces of kneaded, boiled paste in it.
Cold pumpkin dish with dill and pork chops filled with sausage (debreceni)
The popular, traditional way “debreceni” sausage is made: To make “debreceni” sausage both fat and lean pork are needed.
Put bigger pieces of meat in a round hutch.
Take two long-bladed knives in both hands and cut the meat lengthwise until it falls into tiny pieces.
When the meat has been cut in, season it with paprika, salt and pepper according to taste.
Some garlic cut into tiny pieces can go into it either.
For ten kilos of meat pour also a litre of water and knead the spiced meat with it.
Then fill the pig-guts (used for sausage) well with meat.
Let the sausages dehumidify for a day, then smoke them for two days.
Ingredients:
• 4 long sticks of “debreceni” sausage
• 4 chops of smoked bacon
• 2,5 kg of shredded pumpkin
• 5 dkg of red onion
• 3 dl of sour cream
• 7 dkg of fat
• 8 dkg of flour
• dill
• vinegar
• sugar
• salt
• whipped cream
• 4 pork chops
• ground pepper
• marjoram, salt
Salt the shredded pumpkin, mix it and let it stand for 15-20 minutes, then press the superfluous liquid from it.
Make a light roux from the fat and the flour, add the diced onion and half of the fine-cut dill, and finally put the pumpkin in it.
Cook it on moderate fire, mixing it sometimes, add water or stock if necessary.
When it is soft, add the sour cream, salt, sugar, make it sour with little vinegar or lemon juice and add the rest of the cut dill.
Let it cool down and mix it with the well-whipped but not sweet cream.
Wash the pork chops, dry them, take a sharp knife and cut such big holes on the chops that sausages can be put into them.
Rub the holes with salt, pepper, marjoram and put the sausages into them.
Salt the chops from outside, lay a slice of bacon on each and wrap them separately into tinfoil. Then place them on a grate over smouldering charcoal.
Roast them for about 45 minutes, turning them over.
When the chops are well-roasted, let them cool and put thin slices on the pumpkin.
Fattened goose-liver from Orosháza in its grease
The poultry industry in Hungary was founded in 1896 in Orosháza by the B. M. Bernardinelli family, so Orosháza can be rightly called the cradle of the Hungarian poultry industry.
People used to feed geese so that they fatten by Martin’s Day (11th November).
They started the feeding in autumn and twice a day for five-six weeks they crammed the geese with salted corn which they had soaked in water.
Ingredients:
• 800 g of goose-liver
• 100 g of goose grease
• 60 g of red onion
• 1,5 dl of milk
• whole grains of pepper
• sweet-noble paprika from Szeged
• salt (according to taste)
Remove the film from the surface of the goose-liver and remove the veins as well.
Soak it in cold, mildly salted milk for about an hour then dry it with a piece of paper napkin.
Put the goose-liver in a pan, add the goose grease and the onion rings, then season it with whole grains of pepper.
Pour little water under it, cover it and cook it in a mild oven.
Be careful that the inner parts of the liver roast through completely. At the same time do not leave it in the oven for too long lest it hardens too much.
Take the liver out from the grease with a big spoon.
Put it gently on a chopping-board.
Colour the grease with a little red paprika and pass it through a sieve.
When the liver cools down, slice it with a sharp knife and serve it with the chilled goose grease.
Fore-tastes from the Hungarian cuisine: Tatar beef-steak from Hungarian grey cattle
The Hungarian grey cattle wander for years on the Hortobágy, on fields that smell from herbs.
This ancient species which was first found in the Carpathian-basin is the companion of the shepherds living here.

Goose-liver from Bábolna baked on cherrywood, with slambuca from Hortobágy and with mangalica (pork) cracklings
For centuries “slambuc” has been a typical meal of the peasants in Hortobágy.
According to the tradition, this dish is made in a stew-pot, from potatoes fried in bacon-fat and (dry) pasta.
It was ready when the mass agglomerated in a ball, after being turned over 32 times.
Then they placed the stew-pot on a table which had a hole in the middle, and cut theslambuc-ball into as many gyrons as many people were sitting at the table. Then they scattered it with the cracklings fried at the beginning.
Ingredients:
• 20 dkg of smoked bacon of mangalica (breed of pigs with curly bristles)
• 80 dkg of potatoes
• 80 dkg of “lebbencs” (shredded pieces of paste, from 8 eggs)
• 5 dkg of salt
• 1 hot pipy pepper
• 40 dkg of goose-liver
Dice the smoked bacon into small cubes and fry it in its fat in a stew-pot.
Cut the potatoes into thin rings and place them on the fried cracklings. Then pour as much water as to cover it with two fingers.
Flavour with salt and the hot pepper.
When the potatoes are half boiling, shred the paste on top.
Don’t stir it until the paste is tender, but after that constant stirring is needed.
Hereafter feed the fire only with few logs.
If we did everything properly, our slambuc won’t get stuck to the bottom, and we will be able to turn it over 32 times holding the pot  by the ears, as it was done with the original shepherd meal.
The slambuc is ready, when it is nice red and it can be turned over in one piece.
Cut the goose-liver into palm-sized pieces, season it with salt, pepper, and place it on a hot grill.
It is important that it is done well, but at the same time remain juicy.
