Palace of Arts
How about music, dance and fine arts in an area of 65,000 square meters?
The Palace of Arts, a cultural centre that opened in March, promises this and much more.
The imposing building complex on the banks of the Danube, near the National Theatre, is unique in Central Europe in terms of its infrastructure and technical solutions. All branches of traditional and avant-garde arts are represented in this impressive complex.
The building's permanent 'residents' are the Ludwig Museum, the National Philharmonic Orchestra, the Choir and Music Library, and the National Dance Theatre.
The theatre hall is capable of seating 500 people, the National Concert Hall has a capacity to host an audience of 1,800, and other representative multifunctional premises provide additional opportunities for domestic and international stars to appear before the Hungarian public.
