Raphael's Portrait of Pietro Bembo
Three paintings by Raphael, one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance, are on display in Budapest's Museum of Fine Arts.
Besides the so-called Esterházy Madonna (which was stolen for a short time) and a female nude representing Psyche, the collection also contains the oil on wood portrait of Pietro Bembo.  This portrait was probably painted between 1504 and 1506 and is one of the earliest portraits by the master.
The fact that the painting shows almost the full face of the subject and very little background suggests that, at the time of painting, Raphael had not yet broken away completely from the Umbrian tradition.
According to the most recent studies, the portrait, executed in the Court of Urbino, shows the poet and humanist, Pietro Bembo, as a leading figure in fifteenth-century literary life.
