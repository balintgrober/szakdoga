AMD Services – A thousand masterful solutions
Thanks to the mass appearance of office buildings and residential parks of various sizes, companies specializing in the general maintenance of buildings and equipment have carved a niche in the local market.
Based on our assessment, investing companies rarely assume responsibility for daily operation of the buildings following handover, primarily due to the variability of these tasks and their associated expenses.
The increased demand for maintenance and property conservation services has clearly moved the service structure of maintenance companies in a positive direction.
`Instead of small contractors dealing separately with each task, investors today are more interested in working with firms offering complex services, with a professional staff and credible references,` announced AMD Services Ltd CEO Péter Angelmayer.
As a subsidiary of Indotek Befektetési CJSC, an active presence on the real estate development and management market, AMD boasts relevant experience in managing office and industrial properties and residential parks, with special emphasis on B-category properties, which require more expertise and man-hours.
AMD Ltd possesses a well-established infrastructure in addition to a professional labour force specialized for given work phases, and operates its own bases near larger industrial bases (for example in the 10th, 11th and 13th districts), thereby ensuring quick and effective service.
Thanks to the proximity of client and service provider, AMD Ltd does not charge a travel fee and, due to its local knowledge and supplier connections, is able to offer its services at a favourable rate.
Since last year, their quality apartment maintenance services are available to individuals living in residential parks as well.
Among residential parks, AMD boasts such references as Római Garden, Nánási Garden and Madarász Houses.
