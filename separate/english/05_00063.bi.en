Recreation
Traditional Thai Massage
This type of massage is becoming increasingly more fashionable and popular in Hungary.
The dry massage, with a history dating back several hundred years, is carried out by pushing on acupressure points through a special cloth.
In addition to the professional masseuses with master's diplomas, the authentic environment also significantly adds to the overall relaxation experience.

Concert
Cesaria Evora: the bare-foot goddess
The bare-foot goddess, Cesaria Evora, is the "ambassador" of Morna, which is the bitter-sweet music of the Green-cape islands that symbolizes their oppression by the Portuguese conquerors.
She will be visiting the Palace of Arts on April 22-23. In the summer of 2002, she appeared at the Sziget Festival and sat bare-foot on a stool next to the piano, while she subtly divided her time between the microphone, an ashtray, and a whiskey glass.
The concert DVD, Live d'Amor, has been recently released, and it captures the same magic found in the two Budapest concerts.
Exhibition
Hungarian press-photo exhibition
The Hungarian Press Photo of the Year 2004 Exhibition will open at an unusual place, the Palace of Arts, and at an unusual time, after the Budapest Spring Festival.
The absolute winner of the competition, which combines the participation of 6783 works by 266 artists, was Tamás Dezsõ. He is a freelance photo reporter and his works capture the last days of the horserace course and of Józsefváros (Joseph Town).

Concert
Mouth and Pipe Organs
An instrument that is hardly ever played by classical musicians is arriving to Matthias Church on April 1st.
Sigmund Groven and organ player, Szabolcs Szamosi, are bringing a unique and unusual surprise to the 25th Spring Festival audience.
They will play the music of well known composers, from Bach to contemporary authors, on a nearly 300 year-old instrument: the mouth organ.
Groven's performance ranges from his own compositions to his remakes of famous pieces. The sounds from the original mouth organ fuse with those made by the string trio serenade, the solo violin partite and the flute or cembalo sonata for a truly memorable ensemble.
Dance
Jubilee Gala
The 25th Spring festival is the perfect place for Gyõr Ballet to celebrate its own 25th birthday.
A special presentation with a unique dance offering gala will be offered from April 1-2. Pieces of Purim will be presented among others, which were played eight times with great success in New York's Joyce Theatre in 2002.

Péter Eötvös: Le Balcon

The film recording of the work's first night won the first prize of Golden Prague Film Festival in 2002. The musical style that matches the grotesque plot and comic stage play of the original piece was found in the world of French chanson: the music and performance of Fréhel, Jacques Brel, Yves Montand, Leo Ferré.
Péter Eötvös himself conducts the chamber group of Miskolc symphonic orchestra in this powerful opera.

Festival
Mediawave - festival of today's and tomorrow's traditions
The International Film and Music Festival called ANOTHER CONNECTION, the biggest and best-known event of the International Visual Art Fund, is now 15 years old. This event combines an international film festival with a selection of contemporary, jazz, folk and alternative music concerts.
Films that were not released to the public or are rarely seen in cinemas are usually shown at this event.
Films and concerts are also accompanied by photo exhibitions, theatre and dance shows.
László Fehér's exhibition
The KOGART House will present an artist who is rightly considered to be an outstanding representative of contemporary Hungarian painting.
His oeuvre ranges over three decades and collectively it creates a special atmosphere of figurative painting. Starting from the photorealistic works of the 1970s, he has always maintained the objectivity of the camera, but at the same time managed to rise above the concrete space and time found in each of his artistic eras.
His monumental white screens are dominated by one big picture, while the background is neutral and free from concrete historical-geographical motives.
This exhibition shows the works of the past four years, which is a collection that has never been shown in Hungary.
