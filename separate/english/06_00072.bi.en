Motorway M5: Délvidék has high hopes
The government’s decision of introducing a vignette-system for motorway M5 and M5’s reaching Szeged by 2005; for Szeged and for the whole Southern Region this could be one of the most powerful economy boosts of the past decade, and even perhaps of the times since the political system change.
Szeged has not been sleeping hitherto of course, only it took enormous efforts to stay on the map.
It is running industrial parks, dreams of logistic centres, is already drawing on the farm areas near the yet only planned branch-off of the highway, is attracting new technology and, of course, it conducts commerce.
The city is also proud of the fact that even without a highway, the centre of by far the biggest group of the meat industry is here (Pick is the best known Hungarian brand). The biggest glass industry of Hungary could also be built of virtually out of nothing within a decade but with much work.
The only country-seated lease firm of Hungary which has been producing billions of profit for years and is planning to build a billion-worth office building in downtown because it had outgrown the previous one was also not afraid to keep its centre in the town.
The local authority has erected a modern, multilevel parking house in the vicinity of Régi Hungária Szálloda (Old Hungarian Hotel), also known as the late Kass Szálló, which is the oldest and most elite scar of Szeged because it has hopes that the beautiful building of excellent location will sooner or later be teeming with (business) life again.
The new university library is also being built at a high speed; also part of this multi-billion investment is the biggest, most modern conference centre of the town.
After the handover of the building Szeged will be able to house bigger events and no tents will need to be erected on the streets in the downtown even in the middle of the winter to accommodate each guest (hopefully arriving via the motorway soon).
