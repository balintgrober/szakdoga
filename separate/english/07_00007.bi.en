HISTORY
FIGHTS FOR THE THRONE AND CONSOLIDATION
The First Fights for the Throne
Following King St Stephen's death, his nominated heir, Peter took up his uncle's throne without difficulties.
King Peter's (1038-1041) measures appeared to continue the process started by Stephen: he founded churches, issued laws and charters, minted money, and imposed taxes on people.
In contrast to Stephen, he acted with impatient violence, ignoring the peculiarities of the situation in Hungary, subsequently creating irreconcilable conflicts between the king and the whole of Hungarian society.
The church leaders and secular dignitaries conspired against Peter, whom they called a tyrant, and soon dethroned him.
Peter fled together with his family to the German king, Henry III, hoping that Henry would support him in his attempt to regain his power.
In place of Peter, Stephen's brother-in-law, Samuel (who probably descends from the family of the Khabar chieftains) was chosen to be king by the dignitaries (1041-1044).
Some people now expected the restoration of tribal freedom, others the renewal of Stephen's well-balanced policy.
Samuel fell short of these ambiguous expectations, and his position was worsened by the fact that he had to face Henry III's military threat, who supported Peter.
Samuel did not succeed in stopping Henry's intervention - both his military actions and his peace-negotiations failed. His opponents within Hungary were slaughtered.
Then Henry attacked the country and Samuel lost a battle at Ménfõ, where he was killed as he fled.
King Peter (1044-1046), regaining his power with German support, showed his gratitude to Henry III by taking an oath of vassalage to him.
So Hungary became a vassal state, which was the complete denial of King Stephen's policy.
After the bloody revenge of the unsuccessful conspiracies of the dignitaries, a popular rising put an end to Peter's rule in 1046.
While the leading noblemen of the country were discussing the problems of removing Peter and calling Vazul's sons - who lived in exile - back to the country, people in the region beyond the river Tisza organised a revolt with the leadership of the pagan Vata.
It was generally considered as a pagan revolt against the institutions and representatives of both the state and the church.
King Peter was blinded after he was captured, and died soon after. Another victim of the pagan revolt was an outstanding figure of the age, Gellért - bishop of Csanád county, who went to welcome the returning Vazul-sons.
The empty throne was taken by Vazul's middle son, prince Andrew; his elder brother, Levente was pushed into the background.
King Andrew I (1046-1060) suppressed the pagan riot and governed the country following the example of Stephen.
He founded an abbey in Tihany, and its deed of foundation is the first Hungarian charter which survives in the original version.
We can read several Hungarian words and a segment of a sentence in its Latin text, making this charter a prestigious linguistic record.
Andrew I called back his younger brother, prince Béla, to return home from Poland around 1048.
Andrew, who had no children at the time, nominated Béla as his heir and organised the ducate for him.
The collaboration of the two brothers was untroubled for a long time.
They jointly repelled Henry III's attack in 1051 together. With this attack Henry hoped to revenge Peter's death and reestablish Hungary's feudal dependance upon Germany.
The relationship of Andrew and Béla worsened when in 1058 the king made his own son, Salamon, his heir, dismissing Béla.
The hostility between the two brothers did not end even following their meeting at Várkony, and soon they started a war against each other.
Andrew lost a battle, and he died from his injuries.
His family escaped to the German ruler, Henry IV.
Béla I (1060-1063) - like Samuel - ruled the country under the shadow of a possible German attack.
Although this attack was late in coming, there were new problems arising inside the country.
The representatives of common people, who gathered at Székesfehérvár, clamoured against Christianity, that is why this movement is usually called the second pagan revolt.
The rebels were dispersed by Béla, who also took measures for the benefit of common people: he decreased prices and taxes, and abolished debts.
At the time of the German attack, finally launched in 1063, Béla suffered a serious accident, and he died soon.
His sons (Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert) escaped to Poland, as Salamon returned to the country together with the Germans.
The King and the Princes
Salamon (1063-1070) richly rewarded Henry IV for helping him in regaining his throne - the so-called "Attila sabre" might have been taken to Germany from the treasury of the Árpád dynasty at that time - though he did not take an oath of vassalage.
After the troops had left, Béla's sons entered the country, but this time there was no fighting.
The dignitaries mediated between the nephews and signed a treaty, according to which Salamon reigned as a king, and the princes regained their father's one-time ducate.
The king and the princes joined together to defeat the Pechenegs, who attacked the country in 1068.
The story - which had already been popular in the Middle Ages - about the fight between prince Ladislaus and the "Cuman" warrior, who abducted young girls, can be connected to this battle at Kerlés.
The good relationship between the king and the princes deteriorated in 1071.
In all probability Prince Géza had enough of his inferior role, but it is also true that Salamon was incited against the princes by his closest confidant, Vid.
In the first battle of this inevitable clash, Salamon defeated prince Géza.
Meanwhile Prince Ladislaus arrived at the head of the Czech auxiliaries, and under his command Béla's son triumphed over Salamon at the battle of Mogyoród.
The king was pushed back to the region of Moson and Pozsony, the rest of the country was ruled by Géza.
Now the dispositioned Salamon was ready to become a vassal to Henry IV in return for his support, but the German ruler was absorbed in investiture fights, the conflict with the Pope.
King Géza I (1074-77) found a supporter in the person of the Byzantine emperor, who sent him a crown - the bottom part of the present Holy Crown, known as the "Greek crown".
Pope Gregory VII, while couching the feudal demands of the Holy See towards Hungary, after a little hesitation acknowledged the legitimacy of Géza's kingdom. This is why Hungary - in contrast to Henry IV, who patronised Salamon - supported Rome in the fight between papacy and the Western emperors.
During his short reign Géza was unable to do anything about Salamon, it was left to his younger brother, Ladislaus, who was crowned to be king as his heir.
Ladislaus I (1077-1095) made Salamon surrender - sometimes by the help of armed forces, sometimes by treaties - but he was arrested when he organised a plot against the king.
In 1083 Ladislaus canonised the first Hungarian saints, such as the state-founder Stephen and his son, Imre (Emeric), the martyr bishop Gellért (Gerald) and two hermits.
This way he intended to prove that Hungary held a worthy place within the community of the Christian states.
As part of the ceremonies Ladislaus freed Salamon, who left the country and lived among the Pechenegs until his death.
Consolidation at the Turn of the 11-12th Centuries
The internal problems caused by continuous warfare in the preceding decades were smoothed over during Ladislaus's reign.
This was achieved by his very strict laws.
Due to Ladislaus's strict government the country regained its strength, and even became a conquering power - a new aspect to the history of the state.
In 1091 Ladislaus, intervening in a local Croatian war occupied the region along the Adriatic coast.
He also founded a bishopric in Zagreb, Slavonia - though the date is unknown.
Since Croatia was the vassal of the Pope, following the Hungarian occupation the relationship between the papacy and Hungary became tense.
After Ladislaus's death the sons of his elder brother, Géza I, (Coloman and Álmos) were competing for the throne.
Finally Coloman ascended the throne (1096-1116) and Álmos had to be satisfied with leading the ducate.
But he was not content with his inferior position, so he made several attempts to seize power during Coloman's reign.
Sometimes he organised plots against Coloman, at other times he tried to find supporters abroad, but finally he gave up.
Coloman, who initially was very patient and lenient towards his brother's actions, finally lost his temper and had Álmos and his young son, Béla blinded - probably in 1115.
The crippled princes spent the rest of their lives in a convent at Dömös, which was founded by Álmos himself, in 1108.
Coloman was judged unfavourably by the next generations because of the unfortunate disputes with Álmos, although he proved a successful ruler.
He continued to enact laws, started by Ladislaus I, he reformed the taxation system and the structure of the army, reorganised the institutes of legislation and regulated certain rights of possession.
He enlarged the Hungarian church body with the foundation of the bishopric of Nyitra, he reestablished Hungarian superiority in Croatia - which became independent for a very short period of time -, and he occupied a certain part of Dalmatia as well.
He reconciled the papacy by dispensing with his right to appoint prelates.
Coloman was succeded on the throne by his son, Stephen II (1116-1131).
His foreign policy was unsuccessful and there was general discontent during his reign.
Usurpers tried to take over the throne several times, including even the blind prince Álmos.
After the failure of his attempt to seize royal power, Álmos fled to Byzantium. In his thirst for revenge, king Stephen II launched a series of war against Byzantium.
Álmos's son, Béla, stayed in Hungary, and king Stephen II learned of the whereabouts of his nephew.
He brought him into his court and took care of him worthily.
The Premontrian order settled down in Hungary during the reign of Stephen II, and the king was presumably buried in their monastery at Váradhegyfok.
THE LAST DECADES OF THE EARLY KINGDOM
An Activated Foreign Policy
As king Stephen II did not have any heirs, Béla II (1131-1141) was crowned as king.
Instead of the blind ruler, his wife, the Serbian Ilona governed the country.
Béla and Ilona had their political enemies slaughtered on two occasions: first the dignitaries supporting Coloman, who were suspected of participating in the king's blinding, then the supporters of a usurper, who called himself Boris and claimed that he was Coloman's son.
Béla tried to expand the territory of the country over to the Balkans, and he was the first Hungarian king bearing the title of "King of Rama", signifying power over Bosnia.
After Béla's sudden death his young son, Géza II (1141-1162) followed him on the throne, but his uncle (on his mother's side), Belos, governed the country.
The adult Géza led a very active foreign policy.
He launched many military campaigns in Italy, intervened in German local policy and supported the rebellion of the Serbs against Byzantium.
His activity was moderated by two factors: firstly, the two neighbouring states were ruled by the two most outstanding rulers of the age - Frederick I , the German emperor and Manuel, the Byzantine emperor - and secondly, his power at home was weakened by the newly emerging fights for the throne.
He had to cope with several claims for the throne during his reign, first that of Boris, then those of his own brothers, Ladislaus and Stephen.
In the Shadow of Byzantium
Princes Ladislaus and Stephen found a powerful supporter in Manuel, the Byzantine emperor. After Géza's death Stephen III (1162-1172) was crowned in vein, and the king soon had to escape.
From among his uncles, Ladislaus II reigned for half a year (1162-63), then Stephen IV for some months (1163).
The battle of Székesfehérvár put an end to the reign of the latter one, and brought the victory of Stephen III's army.
Stephen IV fled to Byzantium again, and made several attempts to return - without success.
After taking back his country Stephen III continued his wars against Byzantium, when finally his troops suffered a defeat at Zimony in 1167.
At the time of the battles for the throne, the responsible archbishop of Esztergom, Lukas played an important political role.
He was the first Hungarian prelate, and was educated at the university of Paris.
As the relentless warrior of gregorianism, Lukas tried to persuade Hungary to support Rome in the fight between papacy and the western emperors.
He convinced both Géza II and Stephen III that they should give up their rights of investiture.
Being a supporter of Stephen III, he refused to crown Ladislaus II and Stephen IV king, and excommunicated the pretenders, who in turn put him in prison.
When Stephen III took hold of church property, he did not hesitate to excommunicate the king with the purpose of making him more lenient.
Golden Age at the End of the 12th Century
After Stephen III's death his two brothers, the younger Géza and Béla - who had been living in Byzantium for a long time - fought for the throne.
The Queen Mother supported Géza, but the dignitaries preferred Béla.
The prince went into Constantinople in compliance with a treaty, as the fiancé of the daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Manuel.
Manuel's mother was Ladislaus I's daughter, Piroska, who was regarded a saint in Byzantium, and the emperor had serious plans with Béla, called Alexios in Byzantium.
As he did not have a son, Béla was appointed as his heir, and he provided suitable education for him.
Later however, Manuel got a son, so he changed his plans concerning Béla. When a delegation came to take Béla back to Hungary, he supported the idea of his relative becoming king of Hungary.
In the fight for the throne the returning Béla defeated his younger brother, Géza, who died in exile in Byzantium.
The years of Béla III's reign (1172-1196) passed peacefully.
He had a splendid castle built in Esztergom, he founded several monasteries contributing to the spread of the Cistercian order in Hungary, and he canonised Ladislaus I in 1192.
Béla III's rule is significant from the point of view of history of culture: people started going to university in Paris, royal chancellery was in the making, and the activity of credible places (loca credibilia) also developed.
Towards the end of his rule the Pray-codex was compiled, which preserved one of the earliest texts in Hungarian, the "Halotti Beszéd és Könyörgés" (Funeral Oration and Prayer).
In the beginning Béla III maintained his good relationship both with the Papacy and the Byzantine Empire.
After emperor Manuel's death, however, he reoccupied Dalmatia, which fell under Byzantine rule earlier, like his ancestors, he started to conduct an aggressive foreign policy.
While in the preceding decades the military campaigns against Russia were the outcomes of dynastic relationships set up by royal marriages, Béla wanted to conquer the neighbouring Russian principality, Halics for his younger son, later Andrew II.
He managed to conquer it for a short period of time, but occupying Halics remained the main objective of the foreign policy of the Árpád dynasty in the following decades.
Béla III left his throne to his elder son, Imre [Emeric] (1196-1204), Andrew should have kept his father's promise as a crusader.
Prince Andrew, however, intended to rule, and rebelled against his brother several times.
They had a hostile relationship throughout the years of Emeric's reign.
Meanwhile both the king and his younger brother lead campaigns to occupy the Balkans, Emeric even bore the title "King of Serbia".
After his death, his small son, Ladislaus III (1204-1205) became king, but only nominally.
Power was exercised by his guardian, Andrew. The supporters of the child king took Ladislaus to Austria, to protect him from Andrew, but the boy soon died there.
THE AGE OF THE TARTAR INVASION
The New Arrangements
Some years after his succession to the throne, Andrew II (1205-1235) started to bring about significant reforms into life.
He called these reforms "the new arrangements".
The most noticeable element of the king's policy was the giving away of royal possessions in great proportions.
The Árpáds rewarded their supporters with land possessions, too, in earlier times, but Andrew changed this practice in many ways.
Not only did he give more - much more - than his ancestors, but he also presented the lands of the royal county system, which were almost untouched, as royal land gifts, and the beneficiary had the right to bequeath his gained possession to his heirs.
The effects of Andrew II's royal donations were mainly of a social and political nature.
With the organisation of the royal county system, the political supremacy of the ruler weakened, and the created gap was filled by the fastly growing secular estates.
The relationship between the king and the landowner dignitaries was also modified.
Formerly the wealth and power of the dignitaries depended on the offices gained from the king and the income of those. Andrew's donations, however, became the basis of huge private possessions, which brought forth the possibility that in due time landowners could become a self-reliant political factor independent of the king's power.
The gifts decreased royal revenues as well.
Andrew's solution to this problem was to try to increase his incomes by increasingly tapping the sources belonging to the royal prerogative.
He introduced extraordinary taxes and new foreign trade duties, he worsened the quality of money, but he forced people to use it by compulsory exchanges, and he regularly leased the exchange of money and salt trade, which used to be a royal prerogative, and by doing so, he guaranteed a fixed income for the treasury.
In the years of the "new arrangement" the treasurer - the person responsible for the finances of the ruler - became one of the most powerful dignitaries of the royal court.
Each element of Andrew II's measures violated the interests of either a social group as a whole or its individual members, therefore there was an extensive and multifold opposition to the policy of the "new arrangement".
The church was against leasing royal revenues, since those leasing were Jewish and Muslim financiers.
Part of the dignitaries who once supported Emeric, were now joined by those people who did not receive big land donations or turned against the king for other reasons.
Royal service people were afraid of being given away with the land, and the owners of smaller estates, who were called royal servants, feared that they might lose their independence in the shadow of the fastly growing strata of big landowners.
Golden Bulls
The hostility against Andrew II took different shapes from time to time.
A small group of the dignitaries wanted Géza (Béla III's brother, who died in exile)'s sons to act as usurpers to the throne, but their plan fell through.
In 1213 another rebel group tried to assassinate the unpopular queen Gertrude, who supported her own relatives and favourites at the expense of the Hungarian dignitaries.
Another group wanted to play off the underaged heir, Béla against his father, insisting upon crowning the prince.
After such precedents, in the spring of 1222 the dignitaries who supported Emeric - knowing that crowds of royal servants were on their side - forced Andrew II to issue a charter that was later called the Golden Bull, because of the seal.
Some of its regulations were supposed to redress the affronts, others protected the interests of those groups who enforced the launch of the Golden Bull - Andrew II's opposition among the dignitaries and the royal servants - while they also attacked several elements of the policy of the "new arrangement".
Temporarily Andrew II retreated, but he did not even consider enforcing those laws then, not even in 1231, when the Golden Bull was renewed.
However, the Golden Bull was not totally ineffective.
By defining the rights of the royal servants, it contributed to the crystallisation of this social layer, and many centuries later this well-known document of the Árpád age was recorded among the fundamental laws of the "constitution of the nobility".
The political tension in the country did not decrease after the Golden Bull had been issued.
In the last years of Andrew II's reign there were rebels: partly his son, prince Béla, partly the church - that wanted to protect its own interests against the king - acted against him.
The prince was not really successful, but the church managed to enforce to conclude a contract in Bereg in 1233, which redressed their affronts.
In spite of difficulties at home, Andrew II led an active foreign policy.
He initiated many military campaigns to occupy Halics, without any success.
His crusade to the Holy Land in 1217-18 also fell through.
His policy concerning the Balkans was quite successful.
In 1211 he settled down the German order of Knighthood in Southern Transylvania to protect the country from the nomadic Cumans.
The knights, however, tried to establish an independent state, so Andrew II expelled them in 1225.
Prince Béla, who governed Transylvania, was very successful in subduing and converting the Cumans.
In the first third of the 13th century two provinces, lying east and west from the lower reach of the Danube, called "Szörénység" and "Macsó", became part of the Hungarian Kingdom.
A Backwards Turn
Béla IV (1235-1270), who was crowned after his father's death, made it clear even with his first measures that he wanted to break with his ancestors' policies in every respect.
Béla's political ideal was the absolute power of the first Árpáds, and his objective was to restore conditions of the age of Béla III.
He took back the "useless and unnecessary royal land donations".
He had tried to implement his policy already in his father's life - without any success.
After his accession to the throne he started to realise his plan again.
This action brought only moderate changes, but the consequences were rather serious.
There was such great dissatisfaction with the king's policy that in 1239 Béla had to give up repossessing royal donations.
However, the "hostility between the king and the Hungarians" - as the contemporary Rogerius characterised the condition of the country - ceased.
The reason for this was the receiving of the Cumans into the country.
A big group of Cumans settled down in Hungary in 1239 with Béla's permission and these nomadic Cumans soon got into a quarrel with the local people.
Both sides were insulted, but the Hungarians found that in dubious questions their king supported the Cumans.
The Catastrophe
This was the situation in the country at the end of 1240, when the troops of the Mongolians - known as Tartars in Europe - reached the borders.
Julianus, who went to search for the Eastern Hungarians, brought reliable news about the launch of a Tartar attack years before that, but the king was engaged in domestic problems, and the people in the country thought the Tartars were a rambling nomadic people.
Béla was late to take measures to defend of the country; and matters even worsened when the Cuman leader, Kötöny - who was accused of colluding with the Tartars, though it was an unfair accusation - was massacred in a camp in Pest by the mob.
The furious Cumans marched out of the country spreading desolation, but Béla IV lost a powerful army.
In the spring of 1241 the Tartars launched attacks on the unprepared country from three directions.
Béla IV tried to attack their main army with his troops, but he suffered a catastrophic defeat at Muhi, near the river Sajó.
The king's followers saved their ruler with great difficulties, but the majority of his army - there were prelates and dignitaries among them - was lost.
By the summer of 1241 the territory the north and east of the river Danube fell into the hands of the Tartars. Only a few fortresses and castles could resist.
Béla IV organised the defence of the Danube line, and he desperately tried to solicit help from the West - without success.
With the coming of the winter the Tartars crossed the frozen Danube and they tried to find Béla IV.
The king had fled to Dalmatia, and the Tartars following his trace rushed through Transdanubia and Slavonia.
They failed to capture Béla, and in the spring of 1242 they unexpectedly left the country, which they had ravaged previously.
The degree of the Tartar devastation is hard to estimate: the losses of the population might have been 10 to 50%.
The greatest damages were suffered in Transylvania and in the Great Plain; while the mountain areas, Transdanubia and Slavonia were quite lucky.
After a year of war - as it is usual - hunger decimated the population of the country.
The Reconstruction of the Country
Returning from Dalmatia, after the bitter experiences of the Tartar invasion, Béla realised that his policy was a failure.
Instead of confrontations he tried to find the balance between the autonomous development of society and the interests of royal power.
His surveys of possession after the Tartar invasion did not intend to restore the formal royal estates any more, but they guaranteed the people's own legal possessions.
In his policy he focused on measures to repel a new Tartar attack.
He drew a military lesson from the Tartar invasion, so he had stone fortresses built, and with his land donations he motivated his subordinates as well.
Resettling the Cumans into the country was another defensive measure.
Béla IV's other measures aimed at consolidating the economy of the country.
By founding new settlements, or giving privileges to existing ones he created Western-European type cities, i.e. cities with autonomous local governments. One of these was Buda, founded in 1247.
His descendants followed this example later, so the main lines of medieval Hungarian network of cities started to take shape in the decades after the Tartar invasion.
Béla also reformed the minting of money and customs regulations.
He had some new mints set up - in one of these in Slavonia silver denariuses of stable value were minted - and the new customs regulations concerned not only the quantity of goods but also their value.
In his foreign policy the king was busy with the case of the neighbouring Babenberg-provinces.
The Babenbergs were the rulers of Austria and Styria, and the last male member of the family died in a battle fought against Béla IV in 1246.
There were several claims for this valuable province, its fate was finally decided in the fight between the Czech king, Ottocar II and Béla IV.
They came to an agreement first, as a result of which South Styria fell under Hungarian rule for a couple of years, but the fights flared up again later, ending with Béla's defeat, so he had to give up his plans to extend his power over to the west.
The last years of the aging Béla IV were embittered by conflict with his elder son, Stephen.
The exact reasons are not known; contemporary sources suggest several, equally credible answers.
Nevertheless it is a fact that the initiator was Stephen, who governed first Transylvania, then Styria, and finally Transylvania again.
In 1262 he forced his father to extend his part of the country to the line of the Danube, and then he took up the title "younger king", which was unknown up to that time.
The relationship of Béla and Stephen was still not settled, and in 1264 Béla IV sent troops against his son.
After the initial successes of these troops Stephen gained victory.
The peace-treaty signed in 1266 restored previous conditions, but the tension among the members of the dynasty did not cease.
THE LAST KINGS OF THE ÁRPÁD DYNASTY
The Barons and their Dependants
After his father's death the younger king became the king of the whole country under the name Stephen V (1270-72) and in spite of the precedents he was the follower of Béla IV's policy.
Just as his father, he concentrated on the saving of the remaining royal possessions and the development of the cities.
He reaffirmed the majority of his father's city charters and he also issued new ones, for example to Gyõr.
At the same time Stephen, in contrast to Béla IV, was said to be an outstanding soldier, who was able to force back Ottocar II, who wanted to annex certain Western-Hungarian territories to his developing empire.
After Stephen V's death the kingdom of the Árpád dynasty experienced one of its biggest crises of its history.
The throne was mounted by Stephen's child son, Ladislaus IV (1272-90), but the real power fell into the hands of rival baron groups.
The title "baron" - in contrast with modern times - was not yet a hereditary noble title (there was no aristocracy at that time), but it was a word signifying the main royal office-holders.
So the notions baron and big landowner dignitary are not identical although in practice most of the dignitaries bore one of the baron honours for a shorter or longer period during their lives.
The most powerful dignitaries were continuously bearing baron honours, sometimes even several honours at the same time.
The power of the barons was based on their estates, castles (built after the Tartar invasion) and the armies of their dependants.
The dependant was a person, who - at least in principle - voluntarily joined a bigger landowner, preferably a baron, as his servant so he could become a member of his lord's family. (They were called "familiáris" in Hungarian.)
A dependant could have claims for protection and occasional allotments; in return for these he governed his lord's estates and castles, he substituted him in his honours, and most importantly they went to war together, sometimes against the king himself.
The institution of dependants, which spread in the middle of the 13th century, resembles the Western-European institution of vassals, but they are not identical.
In the middle of the 13th century Béla IV, and to a smaller extent Stephen V could put the increased power of the barons into his own service, but after 1272 this balance broke up and the barons got out of the control of the central power, which was about to collapse.
They intended to unite closed regions and establish districts of power, where there was no other influential power than theirs, not even the king's.
For the sake of this cause they fought one another and the king. In this period of private wars violent occupations of lands and other forms of arbitrary measures were most common.
King Ladislaus, "the Cumanian"
Ladislaus IV, who was declared to be of full age in 1277, temporarily stabilised the position of central power with the help of the prelates of the Hungarian church, who suffered greatly from the barons' violence. He also managed to beat off the rebelling of some barons.
Foreign policy became more active as well.
The German principals chose Rudolf Habsburg to be their king in 1273, who claimed the former Babensberg provinces for himself.
In the fight between Ottocar II and Rudolf king Ladislaus IV supported Rudolf, and in 1278 they fought together in the battle of Dürnkrut and defeated Ottocar's army.
This victory was the base of the Central-European power of the Habsburg dynasty.
The conflict with the Cumans put an end to Ladislaus IV's experiments for consolidation.
In 1279 a papal legate arrived in Hungary to give support to the restoration of the strength of royal power.
Instead of helping the king, however, he focused on the violent conversion of the Cumans, who supported the ruler, but lived according to pagan traditions.
He forced the issue of the so-called "Cuman Act". Ladislaus IV was rather unwilling to perform this.
The debate grew to considerable proportions and led to the rebellion of the Cumans.
In the battle of Hód Lake the king put down the rebels, but after that he turned his back on state affairs and lived among his beloved Cumans until his death.
Central power practically ceased to exist: the fate of the country fell into the hands of the rivalling baron groups.
After the death of Ladislaus, called contemptuously "the Cuman" because of his way of life, many people thought that the Árpád dynasty had become extinct.
Dynasties related to them on the female side had their claims for the throne: the Anjous from Naples, the Bavarian Wittelsbachs and the Czech Pnmysles, but the leading dignitaries chose prince Andrew, who was crowned Hungarian king as Andrew III (1290-1301).
The prince had his claim for the Hungarian throne as Andrew II's grandson, and if there had been any doubts around the legality of his origin - as his father was said to be born from the adulterous relationship of Andrew II's third wife, Beatrix - the crowning silenced these voices.
Early Feudalism
Andrew III's main supporter was a political group, headed by Lodomér, the archbishop of Esztergom.
Lodomér and his circle expected Andrew III to break the power of the barons and they wanted to reach their aim by reconstructing the system of government according to feudal traditions.
The system of estates first appeared in Western Europe in the second half of the 13th century.
While vassalage divided the interest groups vertically, from the great vassals of the ruler to the vassal's vassal, estates horizontally creating groups with equal rights, and this way power was shared between the ruler and the orders.
The reconstruction of the system of government concerned the main institutions of political decision making.
Up to that time the members of the royal council - responsible for making decisions in daily matters - were prelates and barons, but now "counsellors sent by the country" were also among them.
The ruler's decisions were invalid without the agreement of the council, a division of power developed.
The new diet was formed according to the very same idea.
It differed from the previous meetings performing legislative and juridistic tasks as now representatives of the nobility also participated and formed a corporate body and had an active role in decision making.
The king and his prelates saw the social base of contemporary Hungarian political system in the nobility of the counties.
The royal power admitted the royal servants to the ranks of the nobility in 1267, which was previously a privilege of the leading dignitaries.
Andrew and his followers wanted to mobilise this new class of nobility against the barons, so they supported and urged the efforts to form local governments.
There was a law which laid down that a chief magistrate, representing the nobility, be appointed in each county.
The corporate body, including the county bailiff and chief magistrates, was responsible for matters in the county.
The chief magistrates were appointed by the king at that time, and their duties included supervising the county bailiffs, who were appointed from among the nobility.
Although Andrew III had to fight against his barons almost every year of his reign, the reconstruction of the system of government - the results of which were recorded by the 1290 and 1298 laws - brought successful results.
By 1300 the barons were slowly forced to surrender, and the position of royal power seemed stable.
This consolidation stopped when the king died on 14th January, 1301.
The Árpád dynasty undoubtedly became extinct with Andrew III's death.
The new institutions gradually disappeared, and the barons, having recovered their strength, turned the fights of the pretenders for the Hungarian crown to their own benefits.
LINGUISTICS
THE LINGUISTIC RECORDS OF THE EARLY OLD HUNGARIAN PERIOD
From a linguistic point of view, the age of the Árpád dynasty is called the early old Hungarian period.
The most important changes in the phonetic and morphological system of the language, and modifications in spelling, which followed them, took place in this period.
Linguistic records from the age of the Árpád dynasty, which enable us to learn about the contemporary state of the language, survived in three categories: Hungarian words scattered in Latin texts, that is sporadic records; short unbroken Hungarian texts, that is textual relics; and finally commentaries to Latin texts (on margins, or between lines), that is glosses.
Sporadic records
Sporadic memories of the language can usually be found in charters.
The oldest authentic charter, which survived in the original version, is the Letter of Foundation of Tihany from 1055.
It is a written document about the foundation of the Benedictine abbey of Tihany in honour of the Virgin Mary and St Ányos. It fixes the land possessions of the abbey and its borders.
Among its Hungarian words (proper names and place names) there are 58 common words, with 33 suffixes.
Among place names there are word-groups and fragments of sentences as well. For example, (in modern reading and spelling) Mogyoróbokorra (monarau bukurea), Óút kútjára (ohut cutarea), Nagyaszó fejére (nogu azah fehe rea), köves homok (cues humuk), Fehérvárra menõ hadútra (feheuuaru rea meneh hohu utu rea).
Consequently the Letter of Foundation is a very important source, concerning phonetic and morphological, and within limited bounds even syntactical aspects of the contemporary language.
Among its proper names we can find Tihany, Somogy and Tolna.
The deed of gift of the Dömös prepostery (1138/1329) assures the Dömös prepostery of their possessions and servants, and enriches them with new gifts.
This charter is also the first collection of Hungarian proper names: it contains more than 100 geographical names and about 1400 personal names in connection with the land possessions of the prepostery in different parts of the country.
Names of land possessions are, for example, Nógrád (Naugrad), Fekete, Bata, Ság (Sagu).
The personal names in it are names of servants.
They are partly of Biblical origin, such as Gábriel (Gabriel), Jákob (Jacob), János (Janus), and partly they originate from common words, such as Lengyel (Lengen), Péntek (Pentuk), Vasas (Wasas).
The biggest collection of names in this period was the Tihany Inventory from 1211.
This charter confirms the contents of the Letter of Foundation of Tihany.
It contains about 150 place names and 2000 personal names.
Some of its place names can be identified with place names mentioned in the Letter of Foundation of Tihany, such as Kolon, Fertõ, Kövesd, Szakadát.
From among the names of servants we would like to mention Patkány (potcan), Látomás (latomas), Szállás (Zalas), Emse, Szombat.
A similarly large collection of names can be found in a charter, issued in 1193, which grants the crusaders of Székesfehérvár their possessions.
In this the King confirms the properties of the Székesfehérvár crusaders (János-knights), which were presented to them earlier, and enriches the order with further gifts.
In the deed of gift there are 55 estate names, for example: Újudvar (Ojvduor), Megyer (Meger), Szulok (Zuloc), Fehéregyház (fejrhigaz).
The Pécsvárad letter of foundation from 1015, which was attributed to St Stephen, is also a very famous one, as it contains several personal and place names.
This charter is an inventory of donations to the benefit of the monastery at the foot of Vashegy.
Actually this is a forgery, made later, around 1220, after the pattern of St Stephen's letters of foundation from Pannonhalma and Pécs.
A linguistic record similar to charters, and at the same time one of the most significant sources of the history of Hungarian education and law is the official report of the Várad cathedral, called the Várad Regestrum.
For the smaller part this book of reports contains the summary of conciliations, testaments, contracts of sale and other matters settled in front of the chapter between 1208 and 1235, and for the greatest part it is a list of red-hot iron tests and scourges which were performed in the hall of the Nagyuvárad cathedral, in front of St Ladislaus's tomb.
In the list more than 30 castle districts, 600 villages and 2500 persons are mentioned.
Place names are, for example: Szerep (Scerep), Szántó (Zamtou), Keserû (Quesereu).
Personal names are: Nemhisz (Numhiz), Ölyves (Vlues), Fehéra (Fehera).
Personal names with accusative suffixes are: Bélát (Belat), Medvét (Meduet).
Anonymus's book about the origin of the Hungarians and the Conquest, the Gesta Hungarorum ("The Hungarians' Deeds") helps us learn about the language of the age.
The author - according to his own words - wrote it so that the Hungarians could learn about the history of their origin and the Conquest from an authentic source, and not "from the false tales of peasants or prattling songs of the minstrels".
Anonymus, in fact, knew the Hungarian regions and the names and location of cities and rivers well, but he did not have appropriate data about the details of the Conquest.
He composed his work in a narrative form, with invented names and stories.
We can find common words (for example, zerelmes "loved", aldumas [áldomás] "blessing"), and several place and personal names among its sporadic records.
These names, however, are not characteristic of the language of the age of the Conquest, but of a later period, after the Conquest, around 1200.
For Anonymus projected the geographical names of his own age to the age of the Conquest, and even more, he invented personal names from these geographical names.
From among his heroes and leaders Zobor was named after mount Zobor, Zalán was named after Szalánkemén, Gyalú was named after the fortress of Gyalú, and Elkölcs was named after the village Elkölcs, next to the fortress of Szabolcs.
Anonymus's inclination to explain names is also reflected in the fact that he gave several naive explanations, folk etymologies concerning place names.
In his opinion, Esküllõ is called Esküllõ, because the Hungarians took oaths there [eskü = oath], he connects the name Szerencs with love [love = szerelem], and he explains that Munkács was called Munkács because people worked a lot there [munka = work].
Textual relics
Textual relics provide a great possibility for acquaintance with the language of the age.
From the early old Hungarian period only four short texts survived.
These are so-called "guest-texts" copied into Latin church service books.
All of these texts were written for the spoken part of Christian church services.
So these relics are the first Hungarian manifestations of early Hungarian Christianity.
In all probability, they are not unique, occasional works; the writer or copier might have put well known, frequently repeated texts into writing.
Their form and high standard language suggest that the cultivation of the mother tongue in the age of the Árpád dynasty may have reached high standards.
The oldest known Hungarian text relic is the Funeral Oration and Prayer from the end of the 12th century, which survived in the Pray codex.
Its first part, the oration itself is not a translation of a Latin funeral oration, but a Hungarian interpretation of it by heart.
The person who wrote it down might have made a lot of similar speeches, before he recorded this one.
He reminds us of the Fall using bitter words, and mentions the fact that by breaking the law in Paradise, the first man brought death into the earth for the whole human race.
The oration is written in rhythmic prose, full of questions and adequate answers, and repetition of words and sentences; a special genre on the borderline of poetry and prose.
The various poetical means heighten the effects of the text, for example: figurative etymology: "halálnak halálával halsz" [you will die with the death of deaths], synonyms: "jorgasson õneki és kegyedjen" [let God be rightous and merciful with him], alliterations: "mennyei malasztban" [in divine grace], "hallá holtát" [having heard of his death].
The second part of the Funeral Oration, the prayer for the dead person, is the official translation of the Latin church text.
The structural division of the text reflects a conscious planning: the full stop followed by capital letters are used to indicate the separate sentences; the full stops followed by lower case letters are used to indicate (sub-)clauses.
The Königsberg Fragment and its Ribbons is a praise of the Virgin Mary from the beginning of the 13th century.
Its text was repeated as a litany.
It consists of three broken text fragments.
The first part is the "Fragment" itself, it is a meditation on Mary as a virgin mother.
The second part tells the story of archangel Gabriel's mission in a colourful, dialogical style, then it quotes the words of the angelic greeting.
The prayer referring to the angelic greeting, beginning with "Ave ...", first appears here in the Hungarian language.
The third part of the text fragment is an extract from a medieval Mary-legend, in which the author meditates on Mary being a mother.
Here we can also find poetic means (figurative etymology, alliteration), for example: "királyok királyának szent arany oltára" [saint golden altar of the king of kings], "angyaloknak asszonyához" [to the lady of the angles], "világon való bûnösök" [sinners on the earth].
The Old Hungarian Lament of Mary is the first poem written in Hungarian. It originates from the middle of the 13th century, and it is one of the most beautiful, and most lyrical pieces of early Hungarian poetry - and of the whole Hungarian literature.
The miserable mother, Virgin Mary, is standing under the cross and she is lamenting the sufferings and unjust death of her saint son.
She is calling her son in pain, then states that she would like to die together with her son.
The author heightens the beauty of his two-beat line poem by using various linguistic means, such as similies: "édes mézül" [like sweet honey], "véred híul vízül' [your blood will become water]; synonyms: "búval aszok epedek" [I'm suffering in pain and agony], "fogva, húztozva, ...ölöd" [you are holding and carrying {it} ... and kill {it}], alliterations: "siralommal sepedek", "választ világomtól", figurative etymology: "Világ világa, virágnak virága" [world of worlds, flower of flowers].
The Old Hungarian Lament of Mary, which avoids Latinisms, represents high standards in Hungarian literary creation, and its author must have had outstanding sense for language, rhythm and music.
The Gyulafehérvár Lines from the second half of the 13th century actually do not form a complete text, they are drafts of sermons, and the leading ideas of sermons in rhythmic form.
This linguistic memory consists of three parts.
The first is the draft of a sermon for the new year, and the author meditates on the question what Jesus's name means to people.
The second part is in connection with the celebration of St Thomas, and answers the question how the believers see Christ.
The third part is a sermon for the Passion Week, and it lists the circumstances which make Christ's suffering especially painful spiritually.
The Gyulafehérvár Lines is a borderland between the spoken and written text.
Presumably it was not written as a poem, but the regular structure of sentences, and rhythmically rhyming lines make it similar to a poem.
Glosses
They preserve the memory of Hungarian spiritual and material culture, so they represent great value from the point of view of history of culture.
There are three glosses from this period.
These are: the Oxford Glosses from around 1230, which contain 11 Hungarian words, the Vatican Glosses from around 1290, which include 4 Hungarian words and the Leuven Glosses.
This latter one appeared in the same codex which contained the Old Hungarian Lament of Mary, and it has 9 Hungarian words in it.
THE LINGUISTIC SYSTEM OF THE AGE
Vocabulary
The written records from the early old Hungarian period prove that the language had a rich vocabulary and it had a well-developed grammatical system.
In the vocabulary of the age we can still find words of ancient origin (Uralian, Finno-Ugric and Ugric words) and also independent Hungarian words created from ancient elements, which played a very important role in the language.
They are partly names of body parts, partly words referring to kinship, natural objects and phenomena, and the everyday life of people: él, lát, eszik, ül, vesz, kéz, mál = mell, apa, anya, fiú, ház, vég, lélek, világ, virág, vén, nagy, édes, szép, fehér, három, öt, hat [live, see, eat, sit, buy, hand, chest, father, mother, son, house, end, soul, world, flower, old, big, sweet, beautiful, white, three, five, six].
The number of loan-words, which were adopted in the age of the migration and during the Conquest, is quite big. For example: szekér, tehén, vám, vásár, csákány, gyümölcs, homok, harang, szeplõ [cart, cow, customs, market, pick-axe, fruit, sand, bell, freckle].
The adoption of Christianity and the organisation of the state brought changes in the economic, social and spiritual life of the country, and these changes left their traces in the language, too.
The meaning of some already existing, old words was modified or changed in accordance with the new conditions.
For example, the words Isten, bûn, ördög, ige [God, sin, devil, scripture] were used in the Christian sense.
The meaning of other words broadened, for example: the word világ [world] also meant 'light' and 'universe'; the word fél meant 'half' and 'companion', the word asszony meant 'queen, princess' and 'married woman'.
Many new words were created with the help of suffixes and word-combinations (though part of them might have existed already in the ancient Hungarian period): kegyelem, intet = intés, áldomás, bírságnap, bútor, egyház, húsvét [grace, warning, blessing, punishment day, furniture, church, Easter].
Words created by inner word formation (onomatopoeia, tone-painting) also appeared: dörög, cinege, cseng, zeng, [thunder, titmouse, jingle, ring].
The number of loan-words also increased.
Words in connection with ecclesiastical life were borrowed from the Latin: kar, templom, mise, apostol, prédikál [chorus, temple, mass, apostle, preach].
From the Slav language Hungarian borrowed the ones which referred either to the church or economic life: kereszt, pap, malaszt, király, megye, ispán, ruha, zab, kádár [cross, priest, grace, king, county, bailiff, clothes, oat, cooper].
Part of the Italian loan-words also originate from this period: mázsa, szerecsen, fátyol [two hundredweight, Moor, veil].
German loan-words are: sáf = korsó, torony, herceg [mug, tower, prince].
Some of the loan-words are so-called "wondering words", which were wide-spread in the majority of European languages. For example: mécs, püspök, pünkösd [wick, bishop, whitsun].
At the same time some words which were used at the beginning of the period were suppressed - later they became old-fashioned: isa [surely], heon [only], fész [prey], jonh [heart, soul], jorgat [have mercy].
From among the grammatical auxiliary words the system of pronouns - which was formed earlier - is almost perfect.
The definite article was created from demonstrative pronouns at that time.
The circle of postpositions - besides the earlier postpositions - is increased with the forms koron [at ... time], képpen [as, somehow].
Concerning proper names the majority of personal names consisted of only one element.
At first the names - in accordance with primitive traditions of giving names - originate from common nouns.
They refer to the body or character of the person described: Nyomorék [Crippled], Hitvány [Wretched], Munkás [Hard-working], Fekete [Black]. Names referring to kinship are: Apa, Unoka, Fiad [Father, Grandson, Son]. Plant and animal names are: Bokor, Szamár, Medve [Bush, Donkey, Bear]. Activity and job names are: Sipos, Lovas, Keverõ [Whistler, Rider, Mixer].
Later Christian names, originating from the Latin, also appear: Pál, János, Benedek [Paul, John, Benedic].
There are hardly any names which consist of two elements; such names include a Latin Christian name followed by a Hungarian common noun: Johannis girhes [John bony], Ladislaus sipos [Ladislaus whistler].
Part of the geographical names are of foreign origin, and these were created well before the Conquest. For example: Duna, Körös, Szamos.
The majority, however, are of Hungarian origin, which became place names from common nouns.
Linguistic records mention several such place names: Füzegy, Agár, Újudvar, Vasvár, Köveskút.
There are a lot of common nouns with suffixes of place names; since the possessive "-é" is modified to "-i" in the early old Hungarian period, and this "-i" has a different role, it becomes a suffix of place names: Püspöki, Halászi, Olaszi.
The method, that villages are named after the protective saint of the church of the village becomes popular at this time: Szentgyörgy, Szentlászló, Szentlõrinc.
It was also wide-spread that the place was defined by a combination of nouns with a possessive adjective (it consisted of a personal name and common name with a possessive adjective).
We can find such place names already in the Letter of Foundation of Tihany. For example: Bagát mezeje [the field of Bagát], Petre szénája [the hay of Petre].
The grammatical system
The main trends of the Hungarian grammatical system had already been formed during the ancient Hungarian period.
In the early old Hungarian period this system becomes more sophisticated and it also stabilises; it is more and more like the system today.
There were more phonetical and morphological changes than syntactical ones.
The sound of the language also changes, the system of sounds became completed.
Spelling - which was also in the making at that time - could not follow these changes for a long time.
The circle of consonants increased with the sounds c and zs, then at the end of the period with the sound ty.
The lip-rounding, voiced fricative at the beginning of words (?) became v.
The ancient Hungarian dz was pronounced gy at the end of the period.
The sounds ? and ? pronounced in the place of k and g disappeared.
Concerning vowels, the process of wearing away of short i and u at the stem of words was completed by the end of the period.
We can still find forms written with vowels at the end of stems in the Letter of Foundation of Tihany: hodu, utu; but these became sporadic by the 13th century (rare sounds, letters).
Other changes in the vowel system made pronunciation more colourful and sonorous.
The back vowel i became a front vowel.
One of the most important changes was that part of the vowels became lower and more open: i>ë, ë>e, u>o, o>a.
The pronunciation of certain vowels became more lip-rounding: i>ü, ë>ö, ?>a.
The two-open-syllable tendency became faster.
In spite of these tendencies sometimes the opposing tendencies also had their effects.
The diphthongs - which consisted of an emphatic one and a less emphatic one - were simplified into long vowels: ou>ó, ou>ú, iü>ëü>õ, iü>üü>û.
The system of word-stems in the early old Hungarian period is very similar to the present-day system.
In the formation of verbs and nouns, besides the ancient one-element formative syllables (for example, -d, -r, -s, -sz, -z, -l were verb formative syllables, -d, -a/-e, -g, -k, -m, -r, -s ...etc. were noun formative syllables), longer formative syllables are used. For example, -dok/-dek/-dök, -dít/-dul-dül, -lal/-lel, -tat/-tet, -hat/-het as verb formative syllables, -csó/-csõ, -ócs/-õcs, -hó/-hõ, -ók/-õk, -nok/-nek/-nök as noun formative syllables.
The ancient signs expressing time and modality of verbs are also in use.
The personal suffix of verbs in the first person plural -muk/-mük changes to -unk/-ünk, parallel with the possessive personal suffix of nouns.
During this period the system of nominal suffixes (inflection) is still in the making; its development lasts till the late old Hungarian period.
Besides the basic suffixes, which originate from the ancient Hungarian period (for example, the accusative ending -t, the suffixes for adverbs of place: -á/-é, -n, -l, -t ) and the suffixes, which were made from these, new, longer suffixes appear: -val/-vel, -nak/-nek, -ban/-ben, -ról/-rõl.
Certain postpositions become suffixes.
The transitional phase is shown by the development of suffix -re/-re, for example: in the Letter of Foundation of Tihany it is still a postposition: "ohut cuta rea" (óút kútja reá), "azah fehe rea" (aszófõ reá), but in the 13th century it is already a suffix: "Balwankure" (Bálványkõre).
The role of certain adverbial suffixes is extended: for example, the suffix -ban/-ben, which was originally a suffix for adverbials of place, takes up a new function, it is also used as a suffix for participles.
The structures and types of sentences and word-combinations are shown, first of all, by the textual relics.
The system of sentences was stable and varied in the period.
We can find almost all the sentence and word-combination types which are used today.
Examples for simple sentences are: from the Funeral Oration and Prayer: "mondá neki" [he told him] - affirmative sentence; from the Königsber Fragment: "ki legyen neki atyja" [who will be his father] - interrogative sentence; from the Old Hungarian Lament of Mary: "Kegyedjetek fiamnak" [Have mercy on my son] - imperative sentence.
Because of the restrictions of the genre of the textual memories (sermon, poem) we can find a lot of exclamations. For example, in the Funeral Oration and Prayer: "Szerelmes barátaim!" [My beloved Friends!], in the Old Hungarian Lament of Mary: "Óh, nekem! én fiam" [Oh my! my son].
Among the compound sentences the subordinating clauses are quite rare.
The clause beginning with the conjunction ha expresses only the adverbial of time.
For example, in the Königsberg Fragment and its Ribbons: "Fel ... mennybe ha tekinte, ékesen téged ... ha láta" [ha = if = when; when he looks up to Heaven, when he sees you embellished].
The way of structuring word-combinations, which was formed in the ancient Hungarian period, stabilised in the old Hungarian period.
There were predicates of verbs, nouns and noun-verb combinations.
The subject could be a noun or a nominal pronoun.
The subject and the verb had to be agreed in person; in case of predicates of noun-verb combinations the number of the subject and verb were not always agreed.
The verbs and participles were made more complex by adding objects and various adverbials to them.
There were a lot of participle structures.
In this period governments expressing abstract relations had already been used.
From among the complements of nouns the adverbial of quality and the adverbial of possession can be found in the Letter of Foundation of Tihany.
The original, unmarked form of structure with adverbials of possession becomes more complicated by this period. For example, in the Funeral Oration and Prayer: birságnap [punishment day], Megyehatár [County border].
In structures with adverbials of possession the number of the adverbial of possession -nak/-nek increased towards the end of the period.
The adverbial of apposition was relatively rare; its main role was to create the atmosphere and make the style more colourful. For example, in the Funeral Oration and Prayer: "mi õsünket, Ádámot" [our ancestor, Adam], in the Königsberg Fragment and Ribbons: "boldog anya, szûz Mária [the happy mother, Virgin Mary].
The complements of adjectives and numerals can also be found in the text, though only sporadically.
Even more, there is some data in connection with the complements of adjectives: in the Königsberg Fragment and its Ribbons: "malaszttal teljes" [full of grace].
The subordinate structures of the text are almost all connected to some kind of a relation.
These structures, formed without any conjunctives, are quite frequent in the Old Hungarian Lament of Mary.
The word order of word-combinations and sentences first of all originate from the ancient Hungarian period, and it is still the same in the present-day usage.
The complement usually preceeded the basic element of the main structure.
Strict restrictions regulated the word order of adjectives and appositions: the adjective stood before the noun, the apposition stood after the noun.
LITERATURE
THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF LITERATURE
The transfering medium: the language
In the age of the Árpád dynasty the Carpathian Basin was bordered by significant cultures. Consequently the country of the Hungarians was a multilingual cultural unit.
Only a very few written relics survived, which would refer to the birth of literature.
Muslim communities living in Hungary had the literacy necessary for practising their religion, which explains how an Arabic codex could get to the Benedictine abbey of Korvey from Hungary during the 12th century, or how Tádé from Hungary - a translator of Aristotle - could reach the Spanish Toledo in the 1170s.
It is also possible that the Muslims, who pursued a very active commercial activity, had practical literacy as well.
Greek Catholic church institutions - the blooming of which could be traced until the beginning of the 13th century - also possessed appropriate liturgic books.
Besides these, as the Greek letter of foundation of the Veszprémvölgy monastery shows, in the age of Saint Stephen there was an experiment to introduce Greek as the language of official matters.
It was a significant fact that in the first half of the 12th century it was Hungary that received one of the most outstanding Byzantine theologians: Cerbanus, the Venetian clergyman found Maximos Homologetes (= Confessor)'s work entitled "Peri Agapes" (= About Love) and also some paragraphs from Ioannes Damaskenos's "Ekdosis" (= Edition) in the monastery of Pásztó and he translated them from Greek to Latin.
Anonymus's work from the turn of the 12-13th centuries preserved a tiny fragment of the every day literature living on the lips of the Hungarian people; although only in Latin translation.
Experts consider the quotation from the 25th paragraph a fragment of a minstrel's song: "Since Tétény wanted to obtain fame and land with his honesty, as the minstrels say: »They all gained place for themselves and in addition they acquired a good fame.«"
Besides this there were a few pieces of work in the Hungarian language in the last century of the age of the Árpád dynasty.
Concerning genres, the first unbroken literary relic of the Hungarians, the "Funeral Oration and Prayer", is a church speech, the "Old Hungarian Lament of Mary" is an example of liturgic poetry, and the "Königsberg fragments" and the "Gyulafehérvár lines" - although they are from a later age, they reflect the 13th century stage of the language - are a sermon and a theological essay.
Starting from the general use of names of heroes from antique and medieval epic (Tristan, hector, Helena, Ehellõs [Achilles], Roland-Loránt, Elefánt [Olivant]) and certain linguistic peculiarities of the South-Slav Troyan novel, some experts suspect that there were Hungarian translations of the works of Western court epic (The Troy-novel, Alexander the Great novel, Roland-Song) appearing at the beginning of the 13th century, but the existence of these is not properly proved today.
On the basis of the first unbroken literary relics of the Hungarians we can differentiate Hungarian and Latin literature in the age of the Árpád dynasty.
The language of the literature from the Árpád age which survived in quite a large quantity was predominantly Latin, more precisely a version of it used in the Carolingian age, called Middle-Latin.
The reason that the Latin language was so dominant in the age is firstly that early medieval literature was basically church literature with settled genres. Secondly because of the way of thinking in the Middle Ages, which strived for universality, but we must also remember the fact that the alphabet in use was most suitable for voicing the Latin sound system.
Change in the predominant role of the Latin language came only at the end of the 15th century in Hungary, but only a very few Hungarian literary works were written then.
The Latin language preserved its dominant role in the West all through the Middle Ages, in spite of the fact that starting from the 12th century the German language became quite significant with respect to Latin in literature and literacy to the end of the Middle Ages.
Though learnt in schools, Latin was not a dead language in the Middle Ages in the modern sense of the word.
It served as a kind of international mother tongue among educated people speaking different languages to get in touch with one another in several territories including diplomacy and literature.
In his legend St Stephen was said to be skilled in grammatics, and this is not far from truth, since he might have spoken Latin, as well as his son, Prince Emeric, legal heir to the throne, who died in 1031.
A Polish source mentions King Coloman - who deserved the epiteth "the Bookworm", and who was educated from his early youth to be a bishop; he might have been consecrated bishop of Várad - as the most intelligent ruler in the world.
The first secular person to be able to read and write - who was known by name - was guest Fulco, who arrived in Hungary at the turn of the 11-12th centuries from abroad, where he earned his living by his skill in reading and writing.
Lord Adalbert, who was sent to Sicily as a minister by King Géza II, might have been of Italian origin: he left a book to the monastery of Pannonhalma in his will.
As a minister and in the possession of the book he might have spoken Latin, perhaps he could also read.
Miklós from the Csák clan (1212-1239), who lived in the first half of the 13th century and was educated by his brother, Ugrin from the Csák clan, bishop of Gyõr, later the archbishop of Esztergom, is also noteworthy.
From among his three wills, the one from 1231 might have been composed by himself, at least its personal tone and complexity suggest this.
According to this a small group of secular landowners (presumably in small numbers) knew and used the Latin language.
In the first half of the Middle Ages the most popular style was the rhymed prose, which was followed by rhythmic prose at the turn of the 12-13th centuries.
Education
The basic means of literary creation, the Latin language, was taught to medieval learners in elementary education.
Concerning the age of St Stephen, there is a datum, according to which a school was functioning in the monastery of Pannonhalma already in the 1010s, that is a decade after its foundation. Its first pupil who was known by name was Mór, later monk and abbot at Pannonhalma, finally bishop of Pécs from 1036, who mentioned in his work, written around 1064, that in his childhood he had been a pupil (puer scolasticus) at Pannonhalma.
According to the legend of Gerald (Gellért) around 1030 this school sent four monks - who could preach in Hungarian - as consecrated priests to help Gerald, bishop of Csanád, in his converting work.
In the second half of the 11th century the chapters were founded with the priests of cathedrals. In the schools functioning next to them elementary education also started.
From the turn of the 12-13th centuries in the monastery and chapter schools the head of the school was the reading monk or canon (= lector), the instructor of liturgic music was the singing monk or canon (= cantor); but during the 13th century in chapter schools both the lecor and the cantor passed their jobs to substitutes (sublector, subcantor).
For three years the curriculum was to read and learn the psalm-book by heart.
Besides education in schools the acquisition of the Latin language was promoted by performing the daily service: the Latin texts recited day by day were easily memorised, and their meanings were understood through education.
The curriculum of medieval education was included in the seven free arts (septem artes liberales).
At the lower level, in the so-called "trivium" grammatics, rethorics and logic (the technique of reasoning) were regularly taught.
In the ideal case, this was followed by the curriculum of "quadrivium", the upper level education: music, aritmethics, geometry and astrology.
The school-book of the Latin language was Donatus's grammatics, but in the age of St Stephen it seemed necessary to get the higher-level Priscianus-grammatics: Bonipert, bishop of Pécs, asked Fulbert, bishop of Chartres, to send it to him; Bishop Hartvic was very modest and said that in his youth he knew this work very well, but by his declining years everything sank into oblivion.
The first Hungarian teacher, who was mentioned by name, was master Gerald in the Guden diploma in 1079, but the place of his activity is not known.
The school of Veszprém had become very famous by the second half of the 13th century, which provided priests, and which was destroyed in 1276 by the troops of palatine Peter of the Csák clan.
The further functioning of the school was guaranteed by King Ladislaus IV by his gift, and in his deed of gift, the school of Veszprém - which taught the seven free arts - was compared to education in Paris with a little exaggeration. It was also mentioned that the legal education there was to serve the defence of the rights of the country.
The priests educated in Hungarian schools also learnt to write besides reading.
From the beginning of the 13th century a prelate was required to be able to read Latin texts and he had to have the skills in church legislature and rethorics, so the Hungarian schools must have satisfied the local needs.
The Dominican order, appearing at the beginning of the 13th century, required theological studies from the members because of missionary work.
In each convent which had more than 10 members the lector held lectures.
However, the organisation of independent higher education, the Dominican "studium generale" (= college) in Buda, took place only at the end of the 13th century.
Till the second half of the 13th century the Hungarian Dominican monks usually received their qualifications abroad.
Those who wanted to receive higher education in Hungary had to go abroad. From the middle of the 12th century they had to go to Paris, then from the end of the 12th century to Bologne.
In French schools theology and the "artes" were taught (Paris, Orleans).
In the modern sense these were departments of humanities, in the Northern-Italian Bologne Roman and canon laws (later medicine and humanities) were taught.
At the universities students learnt the most modern forms of practical (diploma) writing.
So these appeared in Hungary too, as soon as they were introduced, and there the "scriptors" passed the knowledge to one another in the writing workshops.
From the school-books of "ars dictaminis" the theoretical and practical rules of literary creation were learnt.
From Paris the students came home with the title of "artium magister", from Bologe with the title of "doctor decretorum". These students were usually sponsored by their royal or prelate-relatives.
The first Hungarian student who received his juristic education in Paris was Lukas, later bishop of Eger, then archbishop of Esztergom in the middle of the 12th century.
His skills in prelate sciences were greatly appreciated by Pope Alexander III.
Partly by his suggestion King Béla III realised that he must regularly send young men to Parisian schools in his own interest to organise his chancellery.
In all probability Béla II's anonymous clerk belonged to this group of youth who wanted to learn, and in the preface of his "Gesta" he mentioned that he pursued studies of higher education, he might have learnt in a school in Paris or Orleans, and he returned as a "magister".
Miklós, the Hungarian clergyman was the first Hungarian student at Oxford, who was known by name.
The Hungarian Paul (Pál) went to Bologne at the turn of the 12-13th centuries and later, in the 1210s he became a lecturer of canon law at the university there. He then returned to Hungary as a Dominican monk.
In the 13th century more and more Hungarians received their qualifications as doctors of law in this Northern-Italian town, until finally in 1265 they founded a Hungarian section (natio), where all the Hungarian students could unite.
The king supported his loyal clergymen in their studies, since when they returned they became the defenders of the law in the country, office-holders in the chancellery or prelates.
Books and Libraries
Dealing with reading and writing required books.
In his "Second Act" King St Stephen ordered that the local bishop be responsible for supplying the church - built by ten villages - with the necessary liturgical books.
A great majority of these service books were brought by missionaries from abroad.
But part of them must have been written in Hungary: at the foundation of the bishopric of Zagreb around 1090 service books were brought from Esztergom and Gyõr to the new church.
The oldest codex written in Hungary may be the sacramentarium of the monastery of Garamszentbenedek from the 11th century. Only one page of it survived.
The place where books were copied in the monasteries and cathedrals was the writing workshop, called scriptorium.
The Admont-codex, which contains the text of St Stephen's laws incompletely, the Ernst-codex, which contains the St Stephen legends, the Pray-codex, which preserved lithurgic texts and historical records were made in the scriptorium of a Benedictine monastery at the end of the 12th century. The Liber ruber, the book which contains the copy of the charter of the monastery of Pannonhalma was also made here in the 13th century.
The book of gospels from Nyitra and the book of antiphonies from Graz were copied in the scriptorium of cathedrals, and it is also possible that the only copy of Anonymus's work which survived from the beginning of the 13th century was copied in the scriptorium of the royal court.
The oldest authentic Hungarian list of books survived from around 1090 in a charter containing the land possessions and movable property of the monastery of Pannonhalma.
The list mentions eighty codices by their titles, and since they each might have contained more than one, the total of 200 independent works can be identified.
The books served for the daily services and the Benedictine way of life, but among the titles we can find some antique authors, Donatus's Latin Grammatics, the biography of St Martin, the patron saint of the monastery, and the works of Pope Great Saint Gregory, St Augustine and Isidor from Sevilla.
The other significant list of books originates from 1277, when Master Ladislaus, the prepost of Esztergom, made his will concerning his estates and movable properties.
The testament enlists 18 books altogether, which could be considered quite a big private library at the time.
The books in the possession of a secular man were first mentioned in Lord Adalbert's will, which were left to the Benedictine monastery of Pannonhalma by the owner.
A typical case of the fate of Hungarian books, and at the same time the proof that they are treasures is the case of the Bible from Csatár.
The Audience: the Places of Creation
Concerning the place of creation, Hungarian literature in the Latin language in the age of the Árpád dynasty can be divided into two categories.
Part of them are monastery type.
Unfortunately, the authors of these works are not known. The primary goal of these books was that they should be read during services.
They reflected the Roman age in their view: their main element was the preparation for the final Judgement and eliciting fear of it.
The audience for monk-authors were the monk-communities and the secular priests, who then transmitted the content to the people in their preachings in Hungarian.
For this reason their role in the development of Hungarian literary thinking is very important: they were the audience and transmitters at the same time.
St Stephen's larger, St Emeric's and St Gerald's smaller legend and the legend written by bishop Mór belong to this category.
The other category consists of books written in the court, in the king's environment.
Their authors either gave their names or their personality could have been guessed from the writer's self-consciousness in the prefaces.
Their audience was the more or less educated secular, and from the 12th century the highly educated ecclesiastical layer of the royal court.
The prosaic stylistic art of these books often crossed the border of poetry, their rhymed composition sometimes became poems (for example, Anonymus's last lines about the story of Tonuzoba, and the hymn in the St Ladislaus legend about Ladislaus's virtues.)
The Exhortations, St Stephen's smallest legend, Bishop Hartvic's work, Alberic's law-book, the Ladislaus legend, and almost the whole historiography in the age of the Árpád dynasty - which was closely connected to the employees of the royal chancellery - belong to this category.
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONTENTS OF LITERATURE
The different levels of creation
The borders of literature and literacy were less sharp in the Middle Ages than nowadays.
Each text which was written in Latin, consequently in settled forms, and was aimed at a definite audience, was considered as literary creation.
Juristic and administrative literacy also contain certain signs because of which they cannot be excluded from the category of literature.
Charters, laws and synod-resolutions, which were almost all created in royal and prelates chancelleries, and in the scriptoriums of chapters and monasteries, where mostly the historical works were born.
The arengas and narrations of charters urged high quality compositions.
From among written pieces of works these texts survived in the greatest number, there were more of them than the total of narrative texts.
Purely scientific, didactic literature survived only in a very small number from Hungary from the age of the Árpád dynasty, and these were mainly theological-philosophical (St Gerald's Deliberatio), juristic (Paulus Hungarus's works) books or works connected to political science (King St Stephen's Exhortations).
Historical and narrative literature in the age of the Árpád dynasty in Hungary meant mostly chronicles, that is stories about the past (chronicles and gestas, legends), and in a smaller number they were written as memories or history of the age (Master Rogerius's Miserable Song, Riccardus's report about brother Julianus's journey).
Poetry appeared mostly as church or liturgic poetry. Compared to this secular lyrics survived only in very small numbers (Planctus); they were oath inscriptions (The Gisela-cross, the inscriptions on the Coronation cloak) and rhymed epitaphs (e.g.: Béla IV's epitaph).
The Categorisation of Works by their Contents
Literary pieces of works in the Hungarian language survived in a very small number from the age of the Árpád dynasty (e.g.: Funeral Oration and Prayer), which usually followed the original Latin structure, if there was any, but they always satisfied the requirements of the style and genres of the Latin language.
The majority of literary works were written in Middle Latin, and survived in this form.
There was a sharper borderline between ecclesiastical and secular literature.
The aim, audience and function of ecclesiastical literature is totally different from those of secular literature. Ecclesiastical literature was made to enrich and improve the texts of the service (= liturgy), it was supposed to teach moral lessons, it was aimed at church or monastic communities, and its task was to spread religious thoughts to a broad audience.
Secular literature, on the other hand, came into existence to preserve human memory and entertain. It was aimed at prelates and dignitaries at the court, that is, it was for an audience who lived a worldly life. Its task was to propagate and spread political-ruling ideas.
Concerning forms, however, secular literature was often disguised as church literature, but the analysis of the content and aesthetical values clearly shows the characteristics of secular literature.
Was court literature part of secular literature?
Though there were several signs showing that certain phenomena of western court-culture became deeply rooted in Hungary, too, from the beginning of the 13th century. Since they were limited to formality, lacking characteristics referring to the content, we cannot talk about court literature in Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty.
The reason for this could be the lack of a social transferring medium.
The Periods of Literature
In the age of the Árpád dynasty literary creation in the Latin language was continuous. Charters (or references to them, e.g.: a torn off lead seal from King Peter) were preserved from each ruler, without exception. The authors of these learnt in chancelleries from their older colleagues and when they were copying charters they used their predecessors' charters as samples.
In almost each ruler (of the Árpád dynasty)'s court there was a historiographer, who copied, rewrote, or compiled and continued the codices of earlier chronicles.
It is not surprising, that the legends, which were created first and foremost for liturgic purposes, were known and read till 1301, but the fact that the influence of St Stephen's Exhortation could be strongly felt continuously is quite amazing.
Besides continuity there are periods when literature became more intensive.
After the age of St Stephen the first such period is the age of King Ladislaus (1077-1095) and King Coloman (1095-1116), when not only charters, but also legends, chronicles, and laws were created. Writers became aware of their values, and also juristic literacy became wide-spread.
In all probability this improvement was the result of the spread and consolidation of the Christian belief and system of institutions; formally it was shown by the canonisations.
The second outstanding period was the time of King Béla III (1172-1196), when juristic literacy was institutionalised by the organisation of chancelleries. In Béla's court Anonymus wrote a narrative gesta, and the author of the St Ladislaus legend wrote a biography reflecting a worldly philosophy.
Besides the encouraging influence of the consolidation in Béla's age there is a certain purposefulness in the intellectual content of the two literary pieces, and also in the fact that Béla sent clergymen to Paris.
The ruler - his experiences in Byzantium might have helped him in this - probably recognised the possibility and necessity of royal propaganda in literacy.
In addition to the German emperor's crusaders, who marched through the country, also had their influence on the country.
The third outstanding period is the age of Stephen V and Ladislaus IV, when the representations of social conditions: chronicle-writing, hymn-poetry and letter writing became intensive.
The development rooted in the serious problems of social changes, since St Stephen's system of institutions started to break down definitely, and more modern political and social forms took its place.
The Survival of Literature in the Age of the Árpád Dynasty
Till the invention of printing, medieval texts were preserved in handwritten codices, which were exclusively made of parchment till the 14th century, but after that they used the cheaper paper, which was brought from China by Arabic merchants.
It was very rare when texts survived in manuscripts (autographon), but in Hungary there were no texts found with the author's approval.
In most cases there are only copies, the origin of which cannot at all be traced, except by checking the mistakes which were made during copying.
The manuscripts of early works often originate from a later period, and there are works which were preserved only in primitive printed copies.
Manuscripts were copied in the scriptoriums of monasteries, in the middle of the Middle Ages in royal and prelates' chancelleries, and finally at the end of the Middle Ages in manufactures, which were continuously operating.
In the late Middle Ages copying books was in connection with university education.
The size of codices could vary from one eighth of a page (octave) to the big folio, so the sheets were folded into gatherings respectively.
The text was organised into two columns on the page, and it was written with the appropriate font of Latin writing in the age.
There was a big difference between the plain codices in use, which were written with cursive characters, and the beautiful, expensive codices, which were richly decorated with initials and miniatures because of the costumers special request, or the purpose or content of the manuscript.
There are codices, which contain only one piece of work, and there are volumes where several works of the same or different topic are collected (sometimes the later owner had some different manuscripts bound in one volume).
In the course of copying, manuscripts were often supplemented, provided with notes, sometimes they were completely rewritten.
The quality of the preserved book depends on the age, number and quality of the manuscripts.
Considering the antique authors, the first codex of Vergil's work originates already from the 4th century, the first codex of Ovid's works is from the 9th century, and that of Propertius comes only from the 12th century.
The number of manuscripts was influenced by its genre.
Books of general use, books containing lithurgic, juristic and educational texts were kept in several manuscripts: there are more than 8000 Vulgata-manuscripts, around 1000 of the popular Legenda Aurea, and Donatus's Grammatics, about 400 of St Augustine's work describing God's city, 400 of Bishop Isidorus's encyclopedia, and 400 of Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy.
Historical works survived in an average of 50, maximum 200 manuscripts.
The first complete printed book was the Bible from 1455, this was followed by the first editions (editio princeps) of certain works of St Augustine (1467) and Vergil (1469).
The critical editions of the works give information about the survival of the text.
The majority of the Hungarian manuscripts and the earliest ones contain liturgical texts.
From among literary texts the manuscripts of St Gerald's and Anonymus's works were copied almost at the same time as they were written (Anonymus's work was copied not more than three decades after the author's death), these survived only in one manuscript.
The earliest manuscript of St Stephen's smaller and larger legend was made at the end of the 12th century (Ernst codex), but there are later versions as well.
Similarly the synod-resolutions from Coloman's age (together with the Pozsony Year-book) were preserved in a codex from the end of the 12th century, but the oldest codex in which the Emeric and smaller Gerald legend survived originates from the turn of the 12-13th centuries.
Bishop Hartvic's work was not so lucky, since its earliest copies, which contain the unbroken text, originate from the 14-15th centuries; the larger Gerald legend survived in a codex from the 14th century, and the text of the Ladislaus legends was preserved in a 15th century codex and in a primitive printed version (incunabulum); the "Exhortations" and Ladislaus's laws were found in the 15th century Thuróczy and in the 16th century Ilosvay codex.
The earliest manuscript of Stephen's laws is the Admont codex from the 12th century, but this does not contain all the acts, in contrast to this the Thuróczy and Ilosvay codices give the complete, at several points better text.
Master Rogerius's Miserable Song preserved only in the primitive printing of János Thuróczy's chronicle.
Simon Kézai's gesta was the most unfortunate: presumably the only complete manuscript was lost at the end of the 18th century, only the 18-19th century copies are known.
The case of Hungarian chronicles from the age of the Árpád dynasty is very complicated.
Several manuscripts - including the ornamented manuscript of the Képes Krónika (Illustrated Chronicle) - preserved the texts of earlier chronicles, in all probability without changes, but now it is impossible to trace the history of later changes in the text.
As their texts are continuous till the reign of Charles I and Louis I, it is uncertain which part was written by which author.
Still, it is encouraging that fragments of a chronicles (fragmentum) were found in bindings during the last decades.
The earliest work which was printed in Hungary is the Buda Chronicle, which was printed by András Hess in 1473 in Buda at László Karai's expense. This was followed - although abroad, in Brunne and Augsburg - by the Thuróczy chronicle, which also preserved the text of the Hungarian chronicles, in 1488, in two editions.
The Hartvic version of the Stephen legend, the Emeric legend, the Ladislaus legend and the first edition of the Mór version of the Vágvölgy hermits' legend appeared in a primitive print, which was edited many times, at the end of the 15th century in Strassburg (1486), in Venice (1498, 1512) and Krakow (1511, 1519).
(In this case we do not take notice of the extracts from the Temesvár Pelbárt legend and printed breviaries.)
By contrast Anonymus's work was first edited in the very same year when it was discovered, in 1746, Gerald's work was edited only in 1790.
We must not forget the fact that several literary pieces of work might have been destroyed, and we do not even know about them, though there are references to some lost works.
For example, we know that Bishop Gerald had other works as well: he wrote about Holy Trinity and commented on Apostles Paul and John's letters (some fragments from his preachings - the legends suggested the existence of these - were found recently.)
Similarly, the work of Bernard, archbishop of Spalato, King Emeric's tutor, against the heretics, and his preachings were lost, too.
Anonymus also mentioned one of his works, which was written during his years of study about the story of Troy and the Greek wars - in the course of time it was lost, too.
But in an independent form, the whole historiography of the Árpád age was lost.
There are many references to charters and letters, which are also lost.
And we did not mention literature in the Hungarian language, which was almost completely lost...
THE AUTHORS
With and Without Names
Part of the works survived under the name of their authors, part of them survived without that.
The first legend which was born in Hungary, the legend of St Zoerard/Andrew and Benedic, suggests a monastic, ascetic world view, but the author - Mór, bishop of Pécs - mentioned himself by name: "I, the Moor, am a bishop from God's grace now, but then I was a schoolboy; although I could see the good man, (that is Zoerard/Andrew), but I did not know what his monastic life was like, I learned about it through hearing".
We could think that the gloomy atmosphere of the legend was defined by the author being a monk; and the self-consciousness we can feel, is defined by the author being a prelate. This is possible, but it is rather his attempt for authenticity that made the author give up his anonymity.
The other Hungarian author of legends, who mentioned himself by name is Bishop Hartvic: "Bishop Hartvic, who holds this mental office from God's grace, wishes his Lord, Coloman, outstanding king, a happy eternal life after the final limits of life".
The bishop-author's demand for literary perfectness, his skills, and his self-consciousness of a writer is expressed by the fact that he had written a letter of recommendation to the beginning of his work.
According to ars dictaminis, one of the basic rules of writing letters of recommendation, letters or charters is that after naming the addressee, the author of the letter should name himself (intitulatio).
This is how we got to know about the senders of missales (in case of these and charters the person who issued them and the actual writer should be differentiated, of course).
The Emeric legend is a special exception, since luckily its author could be identified with guest Fulco, whose biographical data coincided with the data mentioned in the legend, which referred to the author.
The majority of those who compiled laws were also anonymous, from among them only Alberic - contemporary of Bishop Hartvic, King Coloman's clerk, who framed laws - mentioned himself by name: "To Seraphin, a bishop who burns with the fire of heavenly virtues, from Albericus - although he is one of the smallests - a loyal servant of God in the palace of heavenly contemplation".
His case is similar to that of Hartvic.
In case of scholarly books the name of the author was preserved by the text in the title of the work, as we can see it in Bishop Gerald's case: "Gerald's, Bishop of the Marosvár church, dissertation on »The Song of the Three Youths« to the learned Isingrimus".
The reason why we do not know the name of the person who compiled the text of the Exhortations is that tradition considered King Stephen the real author of it at the end of the 11th century.
The authors of sermons (sermos) are known by name if the supplementary content of the preserving codex refers to them, as in the case of Benedic's, Bishop of Várad, sermons; while at the same time anonymity is quite regular in case of a collection, known as Sermons from Pécs.
Finally we must mention historical works.
The author of the notes in the Pozsony Year-book is not known. We can only suspect that the writer of the first part, till 1060, might have been a Benedictine monk from Pannonhalma.
Before the end of the 12th century the persons of chronicle writers were knot really known.
The experts, who date the primary gesta back to the age of Andrew I and Salamon, suppose that the writer of the Letter of Foundation of Tihany was Miklós, Bishop of Veszprém, since they found stylistic similarities between the texts of the chronicle and the Letter of Foundation of Tihany, and also because the chronicle contains an article on Bishop Miklós.
Drawing conclusions from the notes in the chronicle about St Ladislaus's life, Bishop Koppány from the Rád clan - who died in 1099 - might be considered the author of Gesta regis Ladislai.
The data of Master Ákos's career support the possibility that he was the writer of the gesta which originates from the age of Stephen V.
Simon Kézai named himself in the letter of recommendation: "To the invincible and powerful Ladislaus III, the most glorious king of Hungary, Master Simon Kézai, his loyal priest, wishes that he desire the person, whose beauty is admired by the Sun and the Moon".
The name of Master Rogerius was preserved by the text in the title of a historical dissertation on the age of the Tartar invasion; the situation was the same in case of Prater Ricardus's report.
Brother Julianus wrote his report in the form of a letter, so he named himself in the intitulatio.
There is only one single case when the author calls himself by name - although we do not know his name: the author of the narrative gesta, Anonymus, King Béla's clerk, kept his whole name in secret because of the compulsory modesty of the writer, fulfilling the demands of captatio benevolentiae with this.
The only thing he tells is that his name started with the letter P, so there were a lot of guesses about it.
The experts thought he was one of prelates after Béla III's death, called Peter; either Peter, prepost of Esztergom, or more recently Peter, bishop of Gyõr.
In the letter of recommendation the author tells that he is a "magister" and he was the outstanding King Béla's clerk sometimes, and in school he had a friend, whose name started with the letter N, and at whose request he started to write his work.
Experts seem to agree that the mentioned King Béla must have been Béla III (1172-1196).
According to the surviving data, King Béla III had only one clerk, whose name started with the letter P: it was Prepost Paul, who later became a bishop in Transylvania, then the Archbishop of Kalocsa.
Foreigners in Hungary - Hungarians Abroad
The peculiarity of medieval literature was its international spirit, expressed in the language and the rules of creation. It was inaccessible for literatures written in national languages, and though it increased the intensity of Hungarian literature, it also definitely decreased the tendency to turn outwards.
For an educated clergyman there were more possibilities in the Middle Ages than for a peregrine in the 16th century, since church institutions were the same everywhere and all the educated people spoke Latin.
As a consequence, the foreign environment had a great influence on the works of writers.
The authors of the first Latin works, the Exhortations and Stephen's laws, Bishop Gerald and the writers of charters must have come to Hungary from abroad.
Some of the foreign authors soon returned to their country: Arnold, a monk from Regensburg, performed his St Emeram antiphonies and responcies in Esztergom; Bruno from Querfurt came to Hungary to find Radla, one of the students of St Adalbert, to check the data of the Adalbert-biography.
With the appearance of the first Hungarian authors this process changed in its proportions, but it did not go to the other extreme: in accordance with King Stephen's Exhortations Hungary still meant an asylum and the country offered church career for those who came from abroad, even if the synod-resolutions in the age of Coloman seemed to regulate the reception of foreign clergymen.
Bishop Hartvic came to Hungary because of the dispute around the German ruler's right to appoint prelates: previously he had been a Benedictine in Hersfeld, then he became a bishop, then the governor of the Magdeburg archbishopric, but he soon had to leave his residence and after 1088 he was received in King Coloman's court.
Alberic might have originated from a region where French was spoken, and for him the archbishopric of Esztergom was the ideal place to go.
Cerbanus only travelled through Hungary, but the memories of his visit are his precious translations from Greek.
With the settling down of new monastic orders in Hungary from the 12th century, the western connections of the country became more intensive: the Cystercian monasteries kept permanent and close relations with their mother-abbacies, from time to time the monks appeared in far monasteries and after a certain time they returned to their original residence.
John from Limoges came to Hungary through such a relationship. Between 1208 and 1218 he was the abbot of the Cystercian monastery of Zirc, then he returned home, to France.
Only one of his works is said to be in connection with his stay in Hungary.
This is "Libellus de dictamine", which put the art of letter-writing, the ars dictaminis, into the system of scholastic logic.
John of Limoges created a dictamen-teaching book, which was highly respected in later times, too: the text of it can be found in a codex, which was previously owned by Franceso Petrarca.
If the author really wrote his work, or part of his work, in Hungary, then this is probably the only ars dictaminis written in Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty.
We must remember the fact that in King Emeric's court famous troubadours from Provence were making their poems: Peir Vidal (1175-1210) mentioned among other things King Béla's enormous feet.
The role of the authors who left Hungary and wrote their books abroad is also significant.
The best-known among these is Paulus Hungarus, who later returned to his homeland to encourage the convertion of the Cumans as a member of the Dominican order.
He appeared at the university of Bologne in the 1210s, where he taught canon law, then from around 1219 he joined the Dominican order.
In 1221 he became the prior of St Nicholas' church and the dean of the university of Bologne. Later he returned to Hungary at the request of the universal canon of the order. In course of converting the Cumans in 1242, during the Tartar invasion, he died as a martyr.
Both of his works are in connection with his teaching in Bologne.
In the "Notabilia" he commented on certain parts of canon law, and the "Summa de paenitencia" is the collection of instructions concerning penitence disciplines - a kind of manual for confession.
In the latter there are no signs suggesting a connection with Hungary, but the comments on laws contain a lot of references to the country.
It is certain that both of his works were written during his stay in Bologne.
Both Master Ákos and Master Simon Kézai travelled to Italy, not only because of their studies, but also as the king's ministers to establish dynastic relations.
When King Stephen's daughter was accompanied to Sicily, travelling to her fiancée, Charles Anjou, Andrew from Hungary might have gone with them, but he did not return with the delegation. He became Charles Anjou's chronicle writer.
His personality is very interesting, since he took his "magister" degree with the king's support, then he became the member of the king's chapel ("Master Andreas Ungarus, chaplain and friend of late King Béla and Stephen"!).
Although the topic of his chronicle is not Hungarian, the language and education of the author is the same as those of the contemporary Hungarian chronicle writers.
In his work, which consists of 75 chapters, he preserved Charles Anjou's campaign to Naples in 1266, the event in the course of which the Anjou dynasty obtained the throne of Naples in the fight between the Papacy and the western rulers.
These facts show that the transfer of literature, the exchange of works and the authors leaving their countries was continuous between Hungary and the West from 1000 on.
The universality of the system of institutions - as the base of literature - seemed to function well in Hungary, too.
THE WORKS
Juristic Literacy
The common feature in charters and in pieces of literary works was that the same rules and ideas applied in their construction and style.
The reason for this on the one hand is that the manual and curriculum of literary demands was the ars dictaminis - both for authors of long books and writers of charters, but on the other hand, the authors of literary works were often identical with the writers of charters.
The proof of this relationship is the structural and stylistic similarity of charters, missales or fictive letters and letters of recommendations in the Middle Ages.
Two of the formulae of charters were especially suitable for creating literary compositions.
One of them was the arenga, which - in most cases - was compiled from international arenga-sources, but there were special Hungarian types of it, too.
The other formula, whose text reached the standards of literary requirements, was the narrative of charters; the part that explained the reasons and circumstances of the person who issued it in details.
While narration remained the short and plain presentation of facts in the West, from the second half of the 12th century in Hungary, in the royal chancelleries, it became more and more detailed, and in the case of a gift the king also listed the donator's merits and described the events concerning the fate of the country and that of the reigning and royal family.
As the narrative of charters increased in size, the demand to create more perfect compositions also increased, so finally the narratives were transformed into complete biographies and stories of careers.
These works often show epic specific features, and are carefully structured (parallels or contrasts).
But the most important thing is that this way royal chancelleries were not only the workshops of juristic literacy, but also those of preserving personal or communal memories.
The Genres
The surviving works represent the different genres of the Middle Ages, and the multiplicity of genres shows the high quality of literature.
Regarding the conditions of Hungarian cultural life and the genre existing in the West, it is not possible that in the course of time whole genres were lost.
All that was preserved must reflect the contemporary reality.
The most represented genre in the age of the Árpád dynasty was hagiography. Several facts encouraged the creation of the biographies of saint in large numbers.
As the number of manuscripts and editio princeps show, legends were the most popular, and at the same time they had the widest audience, too.
It is typical that a significant part of their audience - the middle and lower layer of secular priesthood - was also a transfering medium, they brought the literary content of the legend to the widest range of people in the national language.
Liturgy also required biographies: concerning the chants of monks and secular priests, there was a need for suitable readings besides hymns and psalms at the celebrations of saints, and this was usually taken from the biography of the given saint. Sometimes the biography was specially structured: in each of the six hours of prayer there was an appropriate extract to be read.
The medieval practice of spreading ideas also required the means of the legend: in 1183, the first Saints of Hungary were celebrated at various places within a series of festivals all through the year. On 16-17th July hermits Zoerard/Andrew and Benedic, on 26th July, in Csanád martyr bishop Gerald, on 20th August at Székesfehérvár King Stephen, and finally on 5th November Prince Emeric was canonised.
The earliest legend is about the life of the hermits of the Vágvölgy, almost two decades before the canonisation.
The author of the legend was probably encouraged by local and personal adoration, and the development and theoretical foundation of the Italian ascetic trend of monastic reforms.
At the place where St Gerald died a martyr, and opposite this, in the building of the Pest parsonage, the adoration of relics started quite early. But the common ancestor of the two preserved legends was written at the earliest at the turn of the 11-12th centuries, rather around 1145.
From this an extract - a sermon - was made soon at the end of the century and it was used for liturgic purposes. The detailed text was rewritten at several points at the end of the 14th century.
The spirit of the original Gerald legend was highly influenced by the fact that the author - in the worldly environment - used several sources, which could have hardly been obtained in the solitude of the monastery: presumably he used the text of the chronicle from the age of Andrew I, and in the representation of chieftain Csanád's story he relied on heroic songs and local traditions.
The French mentality, established in Chartres, - which was the base of both renaissance thinking and gothic art in the 12th century - was first represented here, and this fact raises the value of the text.
In the sources there is no trace of the admiration of King St Stephen yet, the first sign of the development of this cult is the birth of the bigger Stephen legend, which does not mention the canonisation in spite of the fact that it was written between 1077 and 1083, after Ladislaus's accession to the throne.
The author, who usually wrote for Benedictine communities, worked out an important thesis in the history of foreign relations: he refused Pope Gregory VII's feudal demands for Hungary, which was made in the name of St Peter, by offering the country to the patronage of the Virgin Mary, and so the country became her spiritual heritage (the thesis of "patrimonium Petri" was contrasted to "hereditas Marie").
The author of the smaller legend had already known the work of his predecessor.
His work reflected a completely different view: Stephen did not represent the ruler of the larger legend, who was always looking for the final judgement, but an actual, powerful and righteous king.
This is the first literary work in Hungary, which fulfilled the demands of contemporary literary theory in every respect, there is a recommendation, which refers to the author's literary self-consciousness, and there are certain elements in the text which suggest interest in antiquity.
Whereas the first two Stephen legends were motivated by liturgic and educational points of view, the creation of the third legend was defined by a political aspect. In the prologue the author, Bishop Hartvic, frequently repeated the royal order, and this was not only mere politeness.
The author, who came to Hungary from abroad, did not have other sources than the two previous legends: what he could do was to mix the two texts.
He created an independent chapter, where he described how Stephen received a crown from the Pope.
In the time of the construction of the legend the emperor and the Pope had been fighting for long in the investiture fight, the dispute about the right of appointing prelates.
Hartvic had to prove that because of the papal privilege given to Stephen the contemporary Hungarian rulers had their legal rights for intervening in church matters, which had been unwilling to grant to Christian rulers by the popes since Gregory VII.
The traces of St Emeric's adoration are so faint preceding the time of his canonisation, that Hungarian sources had hardly any valuable data referring to him.
His legend was written between 1109 and 1116 in a Benedictine environment as a reading for monks.
In Emeric the author celebrated chaste innocence, but the critique of the aims of Gregorian papacy can also be felt in the text (he calls Pope Gregory VII simply Hildebrand!).
About one hundred years after the first canonisations, in 1192 at Vrad, at B la III's request the Pope's legate entered King Ladislaus among the saints, and with this the number of saints in the Árpád dynasty increased to three.
Though the adoration of King Ladislaus had already started in the first half of the 12th century, in his canonisation political aspects also played a very important role.
The original legend, which was written at the time of the canonisation, did not survive. It was shortened at the beginning of the 13th century for liturgic purposes, and in those days changes were made in the longer text, too.
The aim of the author was to emphasise the main characteristic features and the virtues of the ideal ruler (in many aspects it was close to the ideal picture of a Christian knight in Hungary), and in his representation he was the first one to use international miracle sources.
Without the legend of St Elisabeth, who went abroad, the legend of St Margaret of the Árpád dynasty (legenda vetus) was the last one born in Hungary during the age of the Árpád dynasty.
Margaret was not canonised, though there were many attempts to enter her among the Hungarian saints. The writer of her legend, Marcellus, her father-confessor, took the official record of the examination of her canonisation as the base of his work. With the simplicity of the language and structure of his work he tried to express the way of life of his heroine, which was quite modern at that time throughout Europe: the idea of Christian myth.
The same is true for the legend of Ilona from Veszprém, which was completed at about the same time as the Margaret legend. In spite of the fact that it came to light rather late, the data it contains about the age makes it authentic.
Only very few, actually only one piece of theological discussion survived, and this dates back to the beginning of the age (monastic regulations written in charter-forms, the rules of the Paulians, and Paulus Hungarus's juristic works do not belong to this genre).
Only one theological work of St Gerald survived; it is the "Deliberatio", but we know that he had written more.
The complicated style and difficult chain of thoughts, the special expressions, the many Italianism and the imperfect sentence structures must have made the work unpopular.
The reason why this genre was poorly represented in Hungary is that St Gerald's work is the one and only theological work representing the genre in the West in the 9-11th centuries.
Though poetry in Hungary served liturgic purposes, its first examples were not preserved in liturgic forms.
It seems convincing that the votive writings of the Coronation Cloak and the Gisela-cross originate from Hungary, and the first Hungarian Leonine hexameter - the spoken invocative formula of the inventory of property from Pannonhalma from around 1090 (Divinum firmet nomen, quod scripsimus amen) - was also written by a native poet. It was continued by Enoch, the Dominican monk, and Cognoscens, Canon of Esztergom, in their charter of 1233: "Cum patre nos Natus iuvet hic et Spiritus almus"!
After St Stephen's canonisation three antiphonies and three responsies were written in rhymed prose to the celebration of the king. Till the end of the 12th century a single antiphony about St Gerald and the Mary-sequence of the Pray codex (starting with "Mira mater extitisti") represented this style.
From the beginning of the 13th century liturgic poetry became very popular; sequences and hymns survived about the saints of the Árpád dynasty.
This process reached a peak in the 1280s, when - probably to the encouragement of Archbishop Lodomer - an Augustine monk from Esztergom wrote a rhymed chant (in which he summarised the saint's life and its message) about King St Stephen to compensate King Ladislaus (the Cuman) IV's Attila-cult and his interest in a pagan past.
The first Hungarian dramas also belong to liturgic poetry.
Although these are just slightly modified versions of European dramas, their appearance was very important. The Twelfth-night Star play (Csillagjáték) was preserved in the prelate service book of Bishop Hartvic, and an Easter play beginning "Quem qaueritis" survived in many places: in Bishop Hartvic's service book, in Codex Albensis and in the Pray codex, too.
The first piece of secular poetry might have been written by an educated, anonymous monk, who, in his work, lamented on Hungary's devastation by the Tartars.
His poem consists of 62 five-line, rhymed verses; its style and careful structure represents high quality poetry in contemporary literature.
The same cannot be said about the Slovenian rhymed chronicle, written by a foreign Cystercian monk, who summarised Hungarian history from St Stephen to 1245, in 27 eight-line, blank verses.
His poems do not reach the standards of Planctus, or the general level of contemporary poetry, either.
A poet-minded, copier monk of the Pannonhalma scriptorium wrote a distichon about the foundation of a monastery by bailiff Walfer to the margin of Liber ruber. This is probably the first example of autotelic poetry in Hungary ("Walfer from the Nagy clan, who actually bears the title "great" [nagy means great],/ had a church built in the honour of the Saint Virgin".).
Letter writing as a genre is worth mentioning, since Hungarian prose in the age of the Árpád dynasty reached the highest standards in this particular genre.
King Ladislaus's letter to Oderisius, abbot of Montecassino, might have been composed by bishop Hartvic, because he borrowed St Ambrus's thoughts from his funeral oration over Theodosius the Great.
A lot of letters survived from Géza II's sister, Zsófia, sent from Admont, but the actual writer of these letters is not known, though he/she must have been a good stylist, who wrote letters of outstanding quality.
Diplomatic correspondence reached high standards in general (e.g.: Béla IV's famous "Tartar"-letter from 1250), concerning its style and rhymed prose. Because of its literary requirements, Lodomer's (Archbishop of Esztergom) letter to Pope Nicholas IV, in which the archbishop lets the Pope know about the undesirable aspects of Ladislaus IV's reign, is an outstanding one.
Historiography
Historiography must also be examined, not only because of the number of the texts preserved, but also because it can compete with hagiography in continuity, popularity and its role to transfer ideas.
Its relics can be put into the following categories: history-writing (the summary of knowledge about the past), memoirs and narrative gestas of an entertaining character.
Historiography - following Western patterns - had already started when Hungary became a Christian state.
Annuals-type records were regularly kept (after the patterns of western monasteries) in Pannonhalma till the 1060s, which were continued elsewhere.
Annuals carried boring, short records of facts; the birth of real historiography can be connected to the appearance of the original gesta, the common ancestor of Hungarian chronicles, in the 11th century.
Although it was continuously cultivated, the peculiarity of Hungarian chronicle writing was that the authors read each other's works, they restructured or combined the text with other texts, they added supplementary information or shortened the original text, sometimes they had a discussion with other writers. The earliest chronicle is from the age of the Angevine dynasty, but the text is a summary of the works of earlier authors.
This means that the time when the separate historiographers compiled their works and the quantity of text written by them can only be defined through thorough microphilological examinations.
Basically there are two different views concerning the texts: according to one (which is more likely) the earlier texts - with slight modifications - were more or less preserved in their original form. According to the other view, however, there was an author living at the beginning of the 13th century, who terminologically-stylistically homogenised the text which incorporated all the earlier historiographic writings.
The other question concerning chronicles is when the ancestor of the earliest texts had been born.
According to the representatives of one possible explanation, based on certain stylistical and historical observations, the first Hungarian historiographer must have lived around the middle or the second third of the 11th century, so either in the age of Andrew I (in this case the author might be identical with Nicholas [Miklós], Bishop of Veszprém) or King Salamon.
Presumably there was a revised version made in King Ladislaus's court, so the history of the Béla-line became the focus of attention.
All the experts agree, however, that King Coloman's chronicler rewrote the whole gesta in accordance with his king's interests.
This chronicler put the struggle of Salamon, Andrew I's son, and Béla I's sons in the center of his epic representation.
Based on certain signs, it is quite likely, that this author is identical with bishop Koppány from the Rád clan.
The larger part of the text that survived is the work entitled "Gesta Ladislai regis" (= The history of King St Ladislaus), but the most changes were also made on this very text, since the different authors tried to answer the political questions of their own age by taking sides in the fight of the princes and Salamon.
After it was continued by an author in the age of Stephen II, the historiographer of the Álmos-line rewrote the gesta, as he did not agree with the earlier points of view. In all probability it was he, who presented the personality and reign of Coloman and Stephen II in dark colours in the age of Géza II or Stephen III.
The chroniclers of the 12th century described the events in details till 1152, but after that only a short extract survived from a German version, which is about Stephen III's reign.
Following this, authors just completed the work of their predecessors with short comments, or at some points they may have rewritten the story.
It is also possible, though, that there were chroniclers during the reign of Béla III and Andrew II, too, but we do not know much in respect of the content of their works.
The story was continued at the end of the 13th century, when the body of the text was increased significantly and a general structure was introduced, which is reflected by all the manuscripts to a certain degree.
In the age of Stephen V, Master Ákos from the Ákos clan completed the chronicle with facts based on family traditions and foreign sources. Additional information was given in chapters concerning the history of the family and the age of plundering campaigns; in the case of the latter one he recorded historical sagas and described the privileges and treasures of the Fehérvár and Buda chapters in details.
His activity became more intensive during the reign of Stephen V, but in the age of Béla IV it reflected the views of noblemen pushed out of power.
With this, the text grew a lot in size, but structural changes were made only by Simon Kézai.
With the purpose of expressing his views on the origin of power, he created the theory of Hun-Hungarian kinship, based on an earlier idea (he may have borrowed it from Anonymus), and placed a long Hun chronicle before the Hungarian chronicle, then he added an appendix to the text, describing the origins of social inequalities in it.
Following this the work of Master Ákos and Simon Kézai became the textual base of all the later chronicles.
Because of its content, the report about Brother Julianus's travels, written by his monk-colleague, Brother Riccardus, belongs to the category of history of the age.
Presumably the author did not know much about stylistic requirements, but this work is a very important source of the history of the 13th century.
The most significant work concerning the history of the age is Master Rogerius's Miserable Song, written around 1243-1244.
The Italian author described the events of the Tartar Invasion in a very expressive way, offering it to his supporter, Jacob Pecorari. In contrast to the traditions of Hungarian historiography, he chose a special form (letter) and a special method (pragmatism) for his work.
His modern thoughts, the form that expressed these perfectly, his style and structure make his work an outstanding one in contemporary literature.
Since he was the source of the history of the age, Anonymus belongs to the category of historical literature as well.
Anonymus wanted to make his mysterious friend acquainted with the past of the Hungarians, so he gave a very detailed picture of the Hungarian Conquest.
The disputes around his personality have not been settled yet, but it is certain that he was King Béla III's clerk, and he wrote his work at the turn of the 12-13th centuries.
Although he used historical written sources, his basic method was that he used place names and his imagination to revive the enemies of Árpád and his people, and with the help of his special geographical knowledge he could populate the Carpathian Basin with various peoples.
Sometimes he used old traditions (e.g.: Chieftain Marót leading the Moravian people), but as a basic method, instead of written sources he used spoken sources (he disapproved of it in his prologue to win his readers) and folk etymology to compile his Gesta Hungarorum.
ARTS
FINE ART
Preromanism
The second half of the 10th century
The conquering Hungarians gave up their nomadic heritage brought from the east in the middle of the 10th century - after their migration to the Carpathian Basin, and defeats suffered in the course of their European campaigns. They assimilated into European Christian countries.
In this process Prince Géza played an important role by accepting Christianity.
They started to build a new residence, Esztergom at that time.
The first palace building and the tower of the fortress, which controlled the road leading to the castle and the trade of the marketplace, might have been built in the age of Géza, too.
The other important center was Székesfehérvár with St Peter's parish church in it.
According to tradition Géza was buried here.
The building with four lobes might have been an early baptisterium before.
Behind it there was a parish church with a longitudinal ground-plan, which has not been opened up till today.
The results of Géza's reign enabled his son, Stephen to establish a Hungarian feudal state.
The castle and church district systems were formed.
From Stephen's laws we know that royal castles were important elements of church organisation.
The baptising churches of royal castles, the centers of archidiacons were the buds of church organisation; from them the network of subordinated churches and chapels was created.
The organisation of royal estates was the basis of forming church districts.
The typical church building of the age was the round church or round chapel, which could be found both in royal castles and near palaces, and they organically assimilated to Central-European traditions.
The St George chapel in Veszprém was probably built at the end of the 10th century, and soon a cathedral was built next to it.
Art in the age of the founding of the state
Art in the age of St Stephen is known only from written sources, legends and later chronicles, as materials decayed.
In this respect first class sources are King St Stephen's legends, in which the authors brought great care to bear upon introducing the founder of the church, who regularly visits the cathedrals and monasteries he founded.
His wife, Gisela, is also mentioned, as presenting liturgic clothes to these churches.
Byzantine works could also be found in Stephen's treasury, and he must have had an outstanding collection of relics.
During his campaign, which he led together with the Byzantine emperor against Bulgaria, the king came into possession of the relics of the St George monastery in Ohrid for a time.
The larger legend of St Stephen mentions the fact that the king presented golden altar tabloids, a ciborium, crosses and rich clothes to his basilica in Székesfehérvár.
Besides St Stephen, Queen Gisela also presented devotional objects to churches.
To the tomb of her mother, who died in 1006, she had the so-called Gisela-cross - decorated with precious stones and enamel - made for the Niedermünster of Regensburg.
The liturgic chasuble, which was presented to the church of the Blessed Lady of Székesfehérvár in 1031, and which was later remade and became the coronation cloak of Hungarian kings, is also connected to her personality.
This piece of clothing represents the universe. There is Christ on the throne (Maiestas Domini) in the center surrounded by angels, prophets, apostles and saints in the company of St Stephen and Gisela.
Besides court art, which was mostly imported, church constructions also had an important role, as they changed the character of the country quite significantly.
St Stephen founded the church of Virgin Mary (church of Our Lady) in Székesfehérvár in 1019, which performed several duties at the same time: the crown jewels of the ruler were kept here, it was a burial place and it received court priests, who settled state matters.
The royal basilica of Székesfehérvár was significant both in state and ecclesiastical matters.
Unfortunately only the foundation walls survived from the Székesfehérvár church, and they were built reusing Roman stone-cuttings.
Its ground-plan shows a traditional basilica arrangement with a semi-circular chancel (apsis) and three naves.
Originally - following Italian or Byzantine patterns - it was decorated with mosaics, but these were destroyed with the exception of a few uninterpretable pieces.
Further memories of foundations made in the age of Stephen are the first cathedral of Kalocsa and the later cathedral of Gyulafehérvár.
The history of constructions of the Pécsvárad abbey, founded in 1015, is still unknown today, but the St Adorjan Benedictian abbey of Zalavár also raises several problems, which is known from a 16th-century draft of military engineering.
The first churches of the 11th century were quite pure and simple buildings.
The majority of them may have been built of wood.
Monumental decoration was not yet popular in this age in Europe.
The fragments, which survived, suggest that decorative stone-cutting played an important role only in the decoration of the inner space - with braided decorations and representations of animal shapes designed according to strict geometrical logic (Zalavár).
One of the best known monuments of the century is the St Stephen sarcophagus.
It is kept in the ruin garden of Székesfehérvár. The sides of the coffin recarved from a Roman sarcophagus are decorated with symbolic reliefs, according to Byzantine tableaus.
Memories of minor art in the age of St Stephen were almost all destroyed.
From among the few pieces of work which survived we must mention St Stephen's "purse", and a golden corpus, which was found at Újszász.
The second third of the 11th century
St Stephen's state founding activity and example defined his successors' aims as well.
Several construction works started in his age were completed only in the middle of the 11th century, and the construction of many cathedrals also started then.
The St Peter Cathedral of Pécs was presumably founded during the reign of King Peter, but the only certainty is that its reconstruction works started after the great fire of 1064.
The St Peter prepostery of Óbuda was also founded by King Peter, the construction works of which lasted for a long time.
Stephen's successors followed his example and tried to found their own monastery during their lives to guarantee a burial place for themselves and their families.
Till the age of King Coloman, the Booklover, it was not a tradition to bury the kings at Székesfehérvár, they were usually buried in their own churches.
The church of Feldebrõ, which stood on the estate of the Aba clan, might have been founded with this aim, too.
The church of Feldebrõ had a square ground-plan divided by four rows of pillars, with a central place enlarged with four apsides on all the four sides and with a crypt decorated with frescos representing stories form the Old Testament.
King Béla founded the Benedictine monastery-church of Szekszárd in 1061, which followed the space arrangement of the developed Byzantine cross-dome churches.
The chancel closed with three semi-circular apsides, the main nave and the transepts rose in a cross-shape, and the eastern and western parts of its side-aisles fit into the system of the Byzantine nine-division space plan, and its four robust pillars must have supported the dome.
This church is a very important relic, because its decorative stone-cuttings also survived, which show further relations to Byzantine art.
The main characteristic feature of stone-cuttings of palmette-braided ornamental style is that they are definitely of Byzantine nature.
Palmette-motifs appeared quite often in significant place of churches at that time: on capitals, corbels, corner stones.
Besides rulers, aristocrats also founded churches in the second half of the 11th century.
Around 1067 Peter from the Aba clan founded a monastery at Százd, around 1061 Bailiff Otto from the Gyõr clan also founded a monastery at Zselicszentjakab.
Byzantine relations appeared not only in decorative sculpture but there were also several Greek Christian churches and monasteries in this age (for example, Tihany, Visegrád).
Byzantine smithery import was quite significant, as it is proved by the partitioned enamelled woman's crown made during the reign of Emperor Constantinos Monomachos IX found in Nyitra, and the partitioned enamelled hoop of the Hungarian Holy Crown.
Wood-cuttings from the Benedictian monastery of Dombó, in the south of the country and the tomb stone from Aracs refer to Byzantine cultural relations, too.
The Roman age
The first period of mature Romanism (The end of the 11th century - the beginning of the 12th century)
The basilica which was divided into three naves by archways supported by pillars, without transepts, closed with three semi-circular apsides became dominant in the architecture of the age. It was usually covered with an open stone-dressing (the cathedral of Vác, the Benedictine abbey of Garamszentbenedek, Szentjobb, Kolozsmonostor).
The Benedictine abbey of Somogyvár, built in the honour of St Egyed, founded by King Ladislaus in 1091, was very significant among these. Besides its architectural values it is worth mentioning since its letter of foundation is known.
The monastery belonged under the control of the Saint-Gilles abbey in France.
Till the beginning of the 13th century the monks had to be French, so this monastery became one of the earliest centers of Hungarian-French intellectual relations.
The founder was buried in this complex, which was built in concert with Lombardian patterns, in 1095, according to his will.
After the transport of the king's corp to Várad a separated relic was still respected - especially after his canonisation in 1192.
From among the constructions of the end of the 11th century the reconstruction of the Székesfehérvár basilica is worth mentioning. In all probability it was done after 1083, when King Ladislaus I canonised St Stephen and his son, Prince Emeric.
The town, which was one of the significant stations of the route to Jerusalem, soon became a national center of pilgrimages.
The basilica soon turned out to be too small, and needed reconstructions, which lasted till the 12th century.
A similarly large reconstruction started in 1064, when the St Peter cathedral of Pécs was destroyed in a fire.
In the church with three naves, closed with three apsides, a huge crypt covered with cross-vaulting without ribs was built under the sanctuary. It was divided into five naves by columns with square capitals.
Above it there was the choir receiving the priests of the cathedral.
The two figurative cutting which survived show the typical iconographical topics of the Roman age: "the fight of the good against the evil".
The constructions of the St Margaret communal chapter church of Dömös, founded by Prince Álmos around 1105, already began in the 12th century.
The Benedictine abbey of Pannonhalma was consecrated in 1137 in the presence of King Béla II and his court.
The details of its early architectural periods were discovered only a few years ago in the course of archaeological excavations.
At the same time big constructions started in Esztergom, too.
Its high quality sculptural decorations enriched with new motifs might have been the work of the nearby Dömös stone-dressers.
The church of the St Peter prepostery of Óbuda shows similar decorative motifs, where the same antique elements appear as those of Esztergom.
The plastic art of buildings was quite various in the middle of the 12th century.
It can be related to Italian, mainly Lombardian, Pavian and other North-Italian styles.
Parallel to the development of outstanding centers building activity became manysided and popular.
The system of private churches of advowees, and clan churches was formed, the most significant architectural element of which became the choir.
The role of these choirs is still not clear.
According to the finding of modern research it was not only the specific place of the advowee of the church, but the altar was also set up there.
There were tow basic types of private and village churches: the first is the so-called rotunda or a central version of that enlarged with a single apsis; the other type was the square church from the middle of the 12th century covered with a flat ceiling. It consisted of a single nave and an apsis vaulted by a semi-dome.
There is hardly any information about wall-painting and book culture; only a few written sources or later descriptions, inventories mention them.
The memory of early wall-paintings is documented only by a few fragments (for example, from the dean church of Visegrád or the royal castle of Esztergom).
At the painting of the church of Feldebrõ besides the Italian-Byzantine tableaus some South-German (Salzburg, Regensburg) adoptions can clearly be recognised, which also appeared at the painting of the apsis of the Pécsvárad abbey and at the first painting of the cella trichora of Pécs.
The earliest memory of book-painting is the service book from the end of the 11th century, called the Nyitra or Szelepcsény Evangelistarium.
This codex written in Carolingian minuscula was made for Hungarian Benedictine use.
Besides the initials drawn or painted on a coloured base, enriched with a sarmentous, stylised bird it is decorated with red, blue and green initials.
The Bible once kept in Bailiff Márton's (from the Gutkeled clan) monastery of Csatár is an outstanding one, called the Admont Bible today.
This memory of Benedictine book-painting from Salzburg was not the only one in the age, it had a great influence on several other codices (Pray codex).
Contemporary smithery - the relics of which survived in great numbers - is represented by a bronze relic-holder cross, which was found as a funeral accessory.
The pieces of seals - as the practise of issuing charters spread quickly and the use of signets became compulsory - were mostly destroyed.
The majority of Hungarian royal signets were also destroyed, and the signet of medieval Hungarian prelates, chapters and convents are mentioned only by the brief description of sources.
The golden age of mature Romanism (The second half of the 12th century)
In the last quarter of the 12th century the Roman style went through a significant change in Hungary.
The reasons of this among others are the following: the stabilisation of royal power during King Béla III's reign, the broadening of cultural relations from Byzantium to Paris, the settling down of new French monastic orders, especially that of the Cistercians, and last but not least the financial stabilisation of the leading layer of the country and their striving for luxury and representation.
The center of this development became the castle of Esztergom.
The most important architectural memories of the age of Béla III were the enlargement of the St Adalbert cathedral and the royal castle.
As the 1188 fire destroyed the archbishopric cathedral, it can be reconstructed only from some high quality fragments.
Such important pieces are the triumphal arch, the Porta Speciosa of Esztergom.
From some fragments and an 18th-century copy of an oil-painting a so-called "incrustrational" technique helped to reveal the sacred topic for the first time, when King St Stephen offers the crown to Virgin Mary in the company of apostles and prophets.
The composition of the scene is analogous with the decoration of the arch of the St Anne Gate of the Parisian Notre Dame, even the rhythmic prose of the writings shows a relationship with the royal chancellery, who were educated in France.
French influence is even more significant in inner arrangement, the inner and outer plastic art and painted decorations of the chapel of the royal castle.
Béla III was the first among his Central-European contemporaries to turn to the Parisian court, which was the western model of court art and royal representation at that time.
The Hungarian ruler invited masters from Burgundy or Champagne to the country, who knew the achievements of the Paris region very well.
While Hungarian architecture followed Western patterns, painting showed Byzantine influence.
However, from the painting of the chapel in Esztergom only the lower part survived, which imitated a curtain, this is definitely the painted imitation of purple brocades representing lions.
The other leading workshop of mature Romanism developed around the St Peter Cathedral of Pécs.
The church obtained its final Roman-age form at the end of the 12th century with its richly divided inner space and its two twin-towers, first built in the east, then in the west.
The arrangement of its decorated inner space can be best traced on the series of reliefs on the two staircases leading to the crypt.
On the northern one we can see the ancient Biblical parents and the standing figures of the six apostles, while on the southern one Jesus' birth and childhood is represented with his tortures above and the Samson story beneath.
The masters of the relief series must have known the North-Italian adoptions of these topics, but the role of the French tableaus could also be influential.
The baldachin of the altar of the Holy Cross, which used to stand in front of the western facade of the crypt in Pécs, shows a definite analogy with the decorations of the churches of Pavia, appearing after the middle of the 12th century.
This decoration style quickly spread all over the country.
The wood-cuttings of Ercs, the fragments with apostle representations decorating the gates - built at the end of the 12th century - of the Székesfehérvár basilica, the outer relief tabloids of the Benedictine abbey of Somogyvár - on which we can see the half-shape of the judging Christ, an angel and a legendary bird and a boy, who is pulling out the thorn - all belong to this category.
At the end of the 12th century - at the beginning of the 13th century the European import of works of art played an important role in the development of Hungarian art.
This process was especially felt in the field of smithery, but the import of textiles and curtains, which disappeared by today, could also be traced.
In the course of this trade carved bronze plates, figural hand-washing dishes (aquamaniles), smokers, crosses and candle-sticks were brought into the country from the most outstanding centers of Saxony, the Rhine region and the Maas region.
Béla III's and his wife's (Anna of Antiochia) funeral regalias made of silver, which were found in Székesfehérvár, provide data about royal burials.
The accessories included a crown, a sceptre, a chest cross, a sword, spurs and a bracelet.
Béla III's golden bull, ring and a disc with partitioned enamels, found in Székesfehérvár represent contemporary goldsmith's works.
The reform policy at the end of the 12th century had its influence in state administration and also in settling down monastic orders.
Besides the dominant Benedictine order the Premontreans and Cistercians began to play an important role as well. They soon represented a completely new view, system and liturgy in the territory of Hungarian architecture and book-culture.
The monasteries of the Cistercians were all built in concert with the strict monastic regulations and the traditional French styles concerning both the division of their monastery buildings and the arrangement of the church.
The details are various but all of them can be characterised by early Gothic space-division and the arrangement of churches, where chapels open from the transepts.
The most important center of Cistercian architecture - which lasted till the end of the first third of the 13th century - was the monastery of Pilis (today Pilisszentkereszt).
The Cistercian abbey named after the Virgin Mother was founded by King Béla III in 1184.
The ruins of the buildings of the monastery, which was destroyed during the Turkish wars, were found in the course of the latest archaeological excavations.
The opening up of the monastery complex and the church with a traditional ground-plan is worth mentioning not only because it had a richly carved, ornamental plastic decoration with animal shapes rich in ideas, but also Andrew II's Meranian wife was buried here.
On the basis of the wood-carvings, which survived, Queen Gertrudis's tomb might have been made in the 1230s and it can also be connected to French art, to the stone-cutting workshop of Reims.
The other significant secular-ecclesiastical center of the beginning of the 13th century was the second cathedral of Kalocsa.
The Archbishop of Kalocsa, who had a serious fight for power with the Archbishop of Esztergom, raised his demands with the fact that he had his cathedral built after the model of French Gothic cathedrals, in a chapel-wreath arrangement and in which the chancel could be walked around.
So Kalocsa became the local center of the territory between the rivers Danube and Tisza.
The king's head from Kalocsa must have belonged to the decoration of the main entrance.
The workshop of Kalocsa may have transmitted the new stylistic elements from the constructions of the royal center of Esztergom to the constructions of the Ócsa, Jánoshida Premontrian preposteries and that of the Benedictine abbey of Aracs.
It was the same in case at the sculptural decorations of the Benedictine abbey of Vértesszentkereszt.
The octogonal pillars of its nave were closed with freezes of animal shapes, and prophets were represented on the prisms of the arches of its gates.
The late Roman age
The spread of clan monasteries defined the characteristics of architecture of 13th-century art.
The plastic art implied on buildings of the age became richer and richer.
Elegant facades emphasised with towers of twin-towers were various, and there was a choir inside the building.
Smaller private churches were meant to look like the family monasteries of rich clans, but we can see the same process in the construction of village churches.
During this age the role of begging orders (Franciscans, Dominicans) became more influential.
The churches and monasteries they built could be found in the edge of towns, usually near the town walls.
The Tartar Invasion did not break this energic transformation.
The revival of the country, which was burnt down during the Tartar Invasion brought about a new wave of settlement, which was followed by large-scale constructions.
The art of the late Roman age developed among such circumstances, which was quite significant concerning its achievements and intensity.
The constructions of the churches of Lébény, Gyulafehérvár, Zsámbék and Türje started then, suggesting the activity of a large stone-dressing workshop.
The abbey of Ják was quite outstanding in its neighbourhood.
South-German characteristics were influential here, both in the architectural arrangement of the buildings and the sculptures decorating them.
The church of Ják, which was consecrated in 1256, is closely related to the memories of Austrian regions.
Several smaller churches in Transdanubia followed the model of Ják, such as church of Csempeszkopács, Magyarszecsõd, Õriszentpéter and Kéttornyúlak, especially in respect of their gates and outer arrangements.
A similar group of masters worked in the region of Lake Balaton, where the architectural details of the church of Litér and Felsõõrs suggested the existence of a larger workshop there.
The most important construction works of the age could undoubtedly be related to the third abbey of Pannonhalma, which was started in 1224, in abbot Oros' time.
The early Gothic inner church also followed the model of the neighbouring Austrian, Czech and Moravian styles, the traces of which can also be found in the fragments of the St George chapel of Veszprém, and later at the fragments of the Gisela chapel, built as a double-chapel of the Queen's palace. This process was the most influential in the decorative sculpture of the of Premontean monastery of Zsámbék.
At the same time there were some efforts to follow the architectural model of classical Gothic art, for example at the constructions of the Cistercian order (Bélapátfalva, Kerc).
Besides ecclesiastical constructions secular ones also played an important role after the Tartar Invasion.
It became necessary to strengthen earlier castles, fortresses and mansions.
Although the fragments of the reconstructed fortresses, towers (Visegrád, Kisnána) are not very significant from the point of view of the history of art, it is a fact that their role was very important during the rebuilding of the country.
A surprising phenomenon of the art of the second half of the 13th century is the special iconographic plastic art appearing in private churches.
It is best shown on the tympanums above doorways, where we can see the representation of the founder (donator), or the usual Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) composition (Szentkirály, Sopronhorpács, Ják, Bátmonostor).
The memories of wall-painting suggest similar ambitions, following partly Byzantine, partly South-German models (Hidegség, Szalonka, Dejte, Süvete).
Since the time of Béla III the pieces of work of minor art prove the adoption and reception of unbroken Western-European (French) influences, especially in smithery.
Liturgic objects with carved bottoms, decorated with enamel came to the country from German territories, and some decades later from the French Limoges.
Gothic art
The style of classical Gothic art in the second half of the 13th century
The traces of Gothic art - which had already been popular and wide-spread in Western-Europe for a long time - could be best seen in architecture in the third quarter of the 13th century.
These influences can be discovered on the building of the Church of Our Lady of Buda, but the same tendencies can be noticed on the building of the Maria-Magdalena church or on the Dominican church and nunnery on the Margaret Island, or at the reconstructions of the Franciscan church and convent of Sopron and the Gyulafehérvár cathedral.
The stylistic trends traced in architecture played an important role in other branches of art.
The new style of the building wave on the Margaret Island had its influence in smithery, too, as it is shown by a hoop of a woman crown decorated with bunches of ivy leaves, found in Stephen V's tomb, which originates from the third quarter of the 13th century.
The coronation oath cross, originating from the second half of the 13th century, the sides of which are decorated with precious stones and real pearls, is a good example of how the tradition of Byzantine miniature works united with the Gothic styles of North-France and the Rhine-region.
At the end of the 13th century imported objects had a very influential role. Such object was the so-called diptichon of Bern - made in Venice -, which can be related to the last king of the Árpád dynasty. The representations of Hungarian saints (Stephen, Emeric, Ladislaus and Elisabeth ) first appear on this, besides Venetian saints: on miniatures painted on parchment, though without independent, special characteristic features.
There were changes in book-painting and the art of making signets - in the spirit of classical Gothic style and iconography.
MUSIC
The basis of liturgy and music
The unbroken development in the country seemed to stop after King Stephen's death.
Though the most important bishoprics were built, and the institutional basis of the spiritual-religious life of the country (the network of bishoprics and parishes, the monastic and chapter educational system) granted the continuity of development and helped to get over the troubles caused by the pagan riots.
While liturgic and music life of the country was quite manysided (in connection with the work of missionaries coming from different regions) in the first half of the century - during the time of conversion and the organisation of the church -, in the second half of the century this picture becomes homogenous, and the leading role of Esztergom became more and more clear.
The newly founded bishoprics - as the one founded by King Ladislaus in Zegreb - ask for liturgic books from Esztergom, accepting its defining and leading role with this.
The 1083 canonisations (Stephen, Emeric, Gerald) also strengthen the unity of liturgic songs, since it brought about the creation of new musical compositions, or the application of the old ones.
The above-mentioned tendency defined the characteristic features of Hungarian liturgical-musical tradition by the beginning of the 12th century, and it reaches its aim in the second half of the century.
"Esztergom is highly respected; it is directed by highly educated archbishops, who had strong will-power; its priesthood is also educated, many of them were educated in French and Italian schools and gained a world-view there, which broadened their «Latin» horizons...
We are now in the course of Géza II's and Béla III's reign".
The Esztergom reform of liturgic songs might have occurred at that time, during Lucas Bánffy's reign as an archbishop. This reform regulated the repertoire of songs ("what we should sing"), the structure of the office ("according to what order we should sing"), and finally the variants ("which melody-variant we should sing").
After this we can speak about "Hungarian Gregorianism", as this reform brought about the collection and definition of the signs of Hungarian music writing, too.
Note sources and Hungarian musical notation
Three service books survived from the end of the 11th century which contained notes or other music records (The Benedictionale from Esztergom, the St Margaret Sacramentarium and the Agenda of Hartvic, Bishop of Gyõr).
The notes in these are the variants of German neuma-writing each, which did not refer to the exact pitch, they only helped to memorise the well-known melody.
The first office book, the Codex Albensis, which originated from the beginning of the 12th century (presumably from Gyulafehérvár), used the same writing technique. In its contents and arrangement it shows the stabilisation of Hungarian Gregorianism.
Hatvic's Agenda and the Codex Albensis contained two dramatic plays, which were popular and well-known in Europe: the Twelfth night Star play (Tractus stellae) and the Eastern resurrection play (Quem quaeritis...).
The origin of such dramatic plays goes back to the tropes (interpolation of verse and music into liturgic texts).
They were sung at the end of the office during the night service, transforming the Biblical story into a dramatic play with numerous dialogues.
Both the Twelfth night and the eastern play had its equivalent in Hungarian folk tradition: one is the Star-pass, the other is the Jesus-search at Easter dawn.
The Pray codex, which contains the Funeral Oration and Prayer, is a few decades younger than the Codex Albensis.
Its notes from the end of the 12th century, beginning of the 13th century already present readable scores written on staves.
These are the first relics of Hungarian music-writing which have survived. It is rather special since it adopted continuous line sketching from German neuma-writing, and the ability to indicate the pitch from French and German note signs. These were united into a new and compact type of music writing.
The systematic combination of different influences could not happen by chance; it must have been created at the same time and in connection with the above-mentioned liturgic reform.
Other musical influences
There is concrete historical data about the fact the Hungarian musical life kept pace with European development in the age of Béla III.
The king sent his court clergyman, Elvinus, to Paris to study the new style of liturgic songs there and he was supposed to bring it to Hungary.
This new style meant the new period of sequence-poetry, which was booming in the Augustine monastery near Paris, and it was connected to Adam Szentviktori.
The movements of the St Ladislaus office, composed in Várad after 1192, reflect the traces of this influence, especially the hymn of the office and the sequence of the mass.
The 13th century is the period of the offices of Hungarian saints, and the development of song-series composed in their honour.
An unknown poet-composer modified some movements of the songs of St Elisabeth - which originated from Germany - to the office of St Emeric, and the office of King Stephen was completed into a whole cycle around 1280.
Unbroken note sources did not survive apart from some fragments due to the historical troubles of the century.
The Árpád-age Missale Notatum (a service book supplemented with notes) is an exception, which was made in Zagreb in the middle of the century and is now kept in Güssing. At the same time this is the first example of the difference between the rite of the archbishopric of Kalocsa-Bács - founded in the 12th century - and the archbishopric of Esztergom.
Music life in the monasteries
It is certain that the first western missionaries came to Hungary equipped with liturgic books containing musical notation.
(For example, the Pannonhalma library records from the end of the 11th century enlisted several service books, which contained notes.)
However, liturgic music life practised in monasteries - with a few exceptions - usually followed the liturgic traditions and musical practise of the western parent-monastery of the order.
In some cases - as in the case of Benedictine monks, who played an important role in the first wave of conversion - the musical traditions of the monastery might have been adjusted to local Hungarian practice (presumably because of the shortening of the missionary period).
While two of the early Hungarian sources of notes are of Benedictine origin (the St Margaret Sacramentarium and the Pray codex), in the case of the Cistercians and the Premontreans, who were settled down with the king's support, there are no musical relics.
The Benedictine, similarly to the two begging orders of the 13th century, the Franciscans and the Dominicans, more or less followed the example of their Western-European centers, thus they were rather exceptional in respect to education and music.
This is also reflected in their music-writing, which used a collection of signs differing from Hungarian notation illustrated with drawings; for example the so-called quadrate writing of the Dominicans and the Franciscans.
At the same time they also had a great influence on Hungarian intellectual life: in pastoral activities the Franciscans were significant (they will be the spreaders of singing in the native language in the following centuries), while the Dominicans played a big role in the booming of intellectual life - since they founded a college in Buda and organised a lot of study-tours abroad.
The highly educated saint of the Dominicans, St Thomas Aquinas, who summarised medieval theology, used his influence with the Pope in 1270 to get a permission for canon Özséb to found a new order, which was supposed to be named after their patron saint, Hermit St Paul (which was the one and only Hungarian founding in the history of monastic orders).
The Paulian adopted the liturgic regulations and melody variants of Esztergom, and were very eager to preserve them as the "emblem" of the order till the end of the Middle Ages - longer than Esztergom did.
The Dominicans were the spiritual pastors of nunneries and associations of lonely widowers, the so-called "begina communities".
The 13th-century manuscript containing the Old Hungarian Lament of Mary - which may have been made for begina-pastoral activities - originated from such an environment.
While the Funeral Oration and Prayer, which is a hundred years younger, meant the beginning of Hungarian artistic prose, the Lament was the beginning of Hungarian literature in verse.
It is still doubted whether it was a poem to sing or a translation for a deeper understanding.
The model, the original Latin poem, is the work of Gottfrid Szentviktori (Geoffroi around 1194), the learned poet of the St Victor abbey near Paris, entitled "Planctus ante nescia".
The Latin Planctus developed from the sequentia-literature of Szentviktor concerning both its language, poetic form and its musical composition. It will be quite influential in Europe, it is sung with various melodies.
The Hungarian text variant is approximately half as long as the original one, and it was recomposed in a briefer version, "which we can consider a marvellous translation and at the same time the first and most beautiful Hungarian poem.
It is a worthly overture of Hungarian lyrics, which was booming for centuries to come..."
Secular musical life and folk music
Besides liturgic, church music there must have been a rich secular and folk musical life, although only a few indirect written documents and the results of comparative folk music refer to this.
One of the famous cases is that of Bishop Gerald, who in the course of his travels - together with his companion, Walther - heard a servant girl singing while winding her hand-mill during the night.
The bishop called this - jocularly by a scientific term - Symphonia Hungarorum, the symphony of the Hungarians (the word "symphony" meant assonance here, according to the original Greek meaning).
The unknown chronicler, Anonymus mentioned the singers reciting epic songs, who were respected guests both among common people and at the festive banquets of the royal court.
Musicians playing musical instruments (brass and percussion) also hightened the level of entertainment at the royal court, just as the famous troubadours and minnesängers (Gaucelm Faidit, Peire Vidal, Neidhardt von Reuenthal, Walter von der Vogelweide) paying a visit there.
Earlier styles survived and became richer in Hungarian folk music: for example, the richest variants of minstrel songs date back to the Árpád age, some of which were almost real cycles - the personality of Stephen, the first martyr and that of King Stephen are mixed in them.
The versification of recitative styles might have started then, and later they might have been transformed into songs as well. The development of psalmodic variants originated from dirges.
(A later example of these is the Lament of Mary from the Brasso region.)
The enrichment of Hungarian folk traditions was brought about partly by the stabilisation of settlement structures and partly by meeting the music of the neighbouring people: in some cases a concrete parallel could be drawn between traditional Hungarian melody variants and European music.
Zoltán Kodály, for example, found a 13th-century Spanish melody, which was quite similar to a Hungarian wedding song - Do not fall asleep... [Ne aludj el...]. (Both of them were traditional melodies of a dawn-song that troubadours sang to their lovers.)
Another Hungarian wedding song (I Was A-travelling Through Hills and Valleys [Hegyen-völgyön járogatok vala]) had an even closer equivalent recalling the conductus (Solvitur in libro Salomonis...) - a song accompanying marching - of a 12th-century French liturgic drama (the so-called Daniel-play).
"Behind the melodies of weddings, match-makings, and other melodies of Midsummer Night, which are related to match-making, there is an early medieval European background" (L. Dobszay).
The flourishing of these, however, dates back to the late Middle Ages.
DANCE
The art of dance in the age of the Árpád dynasty
Local and foreign sources which refer to dance at the age of the Árpád dynasty are quite scanty and at the same time rather manyfold.
The expressions musica sacra, musica aulika, musica bellica and musica profana refer to the fields of medieval culture where music played an important role.
Dance did not yet have such a social position, sophisticated genres and forms as music had.
The ideas sacred dance, court dance, war dance and profane dance, however, are capable of expressing contemporary dance phenomena - through the close relationship between music and the art of dance.
Sacred dances
Dancing at sacred places (in temples, cemeteries, tombs of saints) was a general tradition in the early centuries of Christianity.
According to the Roman ecclesiastic writer, Tertullian, Christians, for example, performed canticums and hymns accompanied by dancing at the turn of the 2nd-3rd centuries.
Biblical dance scenes became the theme of sacred dances, and representations on sacred objects became widely used symbols.
For a Christian, as with music and poetry, dance was the means of approaching God.
According to a general belief, dance was the saint activity of angels, and the souls of sinners repented their sins in Hell in ecstatic dances, too.
With time the Christian Church saw a big danger in the ritual dances of newly christened peoples, which were firstly given a place in the order of the service, at the vigils of great celebrations and at services performed during these celebrations.
They were considered profane and rude, but according to people who practised them, they were the same sacred dances as the circular dances of the early Christians.
Almost all the outstanding church fathers left a written document in which they banned the practice of profane dances.
Among the resolutions of universal and local ecclesiastical synods we can find many, which banned dances and performances of professional entertainers (joculators) till the end of the Middle Ages.
The resolutions of the 1198 synod in Paris, the 1215 synod in Rome and the 1279 synod in Buda, for example, were similar concerning this topic.
According to the 46th resolution of the Buda synod "priests should not tolerate people dancing in cemeteries, or inside churches, because according to St Augustine one should rather hoe or plough during feasts than dance".
In concert with the sources it seems that when Christianity became general in Hungary, the church turned away from dances as they considered dance the Devil's work - under the influence of medieval mythic thinkers.
From among Hungarian relics, which prohibited dancing, St Gerald's meditation - written between 1001 and 1004 - is worth mentioning. In this he protests against the bad habits of priests, who like hunting, carrying in lawsuits, and the performances of joculators (entertainers, who played music and danced).
In King Coloman's time the 1100 synod at Esztergom had to punish the priests participating in "festive banquets" because of their debauched behaviour.
Because of the series of bans, dances gradually disappeared from churches during the Middle Ages. However, the fashion of representing Biblical dances survived according to the sources.
One of the most beautiful Hungarian examples from the age of the Árpád dynasty is the two pictures of the Monomachos crown made of partitioned enamel. These probably show Prophet Mirjam's triumphal dance after crossing the Red Sea.
It is a Byzantine work; King Monomachos presented it to King Géza II in the 1070s.
The bronze plate representing different musicians and a woman, who is in an acrobatic pose, was also made in Byzantine.
On the basis of international parallels this woman probably represents the Biblical Salome.
The same figure can be seen on the gates and capitals of several Western-European churches (for example, in the St Zeno church in Verona from the 11th century).
The representation of the dance of the angels was a popular topic in ecclesiastical art for centuries.
Byzantine church father, St Basil the Great, had already written in the 4th century that the main activity of angels in Heaven is dancing (tripodium), which he considers a model to be followed on earth, too.
Such a case is not known in Hungary from the age of the Árpád dynasty, but on the basis of European parallels it is likely that once it existed.
Unfortunately none of the medieval Hungarian illustrated books (Illustrated legends, the Nekcse Bible, Illustrated Chronicle) contain representations of sacred or Biblical dances, while King David's dance in front of the ark, David's (who defeated Goliat) greeting with dances and the dance of angels in Heaven appeared several times in 12th-13th-century Western-European codices.
Court dances
The medieval fashion for collective dances was the proof of a European cultural unit, which was taking shape then. It started in the West and spread throughout the continent.
In the background there was the specific way of life and culture of the European nobility, the so-called court life, in which dances played an essential role.
Besides court poetry and music dance also helped to separate nobility sharply from the layer of peasants and the middle classes, and create a separate culture.
The best well-known dance was the round dance, which originally consisted of a women's round dance accompanied by singing and a walking pair dance, processing in a circle, which was accompanied by musical instruments.
In the course of time these two parts came nearer to each other concerning their characteristic features, so the former one could be danced in pairs, accompanied by musical instruments, and later both were supplemented with new, faster, leaping dances.
The conditions of court culture had developed in Hungary by the 13th century: royal court with a permanent residence, balanced power conditions and intensive international relations.
In the time between the reign of Béla III and Sigismund, the Hungarian royal court was highly respected, it was the meeting place of rulers.
Hungarian kings got into kinship with ruling families, who owned the richest courts (centers of knights) in Europe.
The visits paid by rulers, family celebrations, coronations, receptions of ministers, international negotiations took place according to the rules of court (knight) services, where fights, tournaments, banquets, hunts, dances and other forms of entertainment were essential.
War dances
A note from the 10th century referring to the plundering Hungarians - the St Gallen adventure described in the Ekkehard chronicle - said that the warriors started a triumphal feast in the monastery yard and "they performed an ecstatic dance in front of their leaders".
Later Anonymus's Gesta mentioned - when writing about the Conquest of the Carpathian Basin by the Hungarians - that after successful battles Árpád's warriors had feasts: for example, at the occupation of the Nyír regions "the warriors had great happiness in their hearts and having a feast each of them was very proud of his success".
When he described the 20-day feast held after taking over Etzilburg (Óbuda) - which was supposed to be the Hun king, Attila's town -, which they occupied without any fighting, he coloured the stories with the knightly pathos of his age.
These references might cover a pantomime-like dance-play, which can still be found in the folklore of Asian peoples.
The scanty sources mentioning these early war dances may be the disappearing elements of many-folded, rich historic traditions.
Profane dances
The medieval church considered everything profane which was outside the borders of consecrated religious life and was not reconcilable with the disciplines and ideas of the Christian church.
Thus several elements of traditional culture found in the Carpathian Basin and brought from the East (heroic songs, ritual dances, cultic services) stayed outside this circle just as the performance of dancers, singers and musicians, who recalled the memories of ancient Roman and Byzantine (maybe Eastern) cultures.
There is exact data about the places of settlements and possessions of joculators, chroniclers, minstrels (professional entertainers) often mentioned in Hungarian sources, but we do not know much about the pieces of work created by them.
On the basis of the sources they seem to be a special social layer including people of different origin and various social positions.
Many of them settled down and served the king or noblemen, others were wandering through Europe earning their living by entertaining people.
Secular and ecclesiastical dignitaries, priests, monks, citizens of towns and even villeins raised their claims for their services.
Skillful entertainers had to be able to improvise poems, perform acrobatic exercises, play musical instruments, sing and dance alike in the 12th-13th centuries.
In the absence of sources the traditional dances of Hungarian common people living in the age of the Árpád dynasty can still be reconstructed from historical sources of later ages and 19th-20th century folk dances.
On the basis of comparative historical and folklore researches it seems that in this period of time dance, music, drama, games and sports were closely related to one another in the traditional culture; both in rites and outside rites, in sacred and profane environment alike.
When describing the wedding of Árpád's son, Zolta, held at the turn of the 12-13th centuries, Anonymus used the verb "ludere" (play).
In Hungarian sources the word "rave" also appeared.
The word "dance" referring uniformly only to art of rhythmic movements was under development in this age in Europe, and as an international loan word it appeared in Hungary only in the middle of the 14th century.
CHURCH HISTORY
ST STEPHEN'S HERITAGE
A country of many languages and traditions
In the course of their migration the Hungarians got acquainted with monotheistic religions which accompanied them to the Carpathian Basin.
Till the Tartar Invasion of 1241 there were Muslim people living in Hungary in quite a significant number. They were called Böszörménys, Ismaelites, Káliz-s or Moors.
There were isolated communities of Muslims in 80 villages of 26 counties. It was the third biggest Muslim population in contemporary Western Europe after the Iberian peninsula and South Italy.
They were very active in royal financial matters, and many of them were tradesmen or mercenaries defending the border.
Some of them came to the Carpathian Basin together with the Hungarians at the end of the 9th century, others settled down later spontaneously, for example, together with the Petchenegs, as tradesmen in the course of military recruitment.
The synod of Szabolcs tried to convert them into Catholicism by transferring half of the Muslim population to other places, the synod of Tarcal decided to build Catholic churches in their villages and obliged them to mixed marriages.
Between 1150-1220 a peaceful assimilation started among them, but the harassment in the age of Andrew II put an end to it.
According to some theories there might have been several Jews among the members of the Khabar tribes which joined the Hungarians.
From the 11th century the Jews lived in urban settlements in smaller communities (in diaspores).
The synod of Szabolcs prohibited the mixed marriages with Christians, or keeping Christian servants, or working on Christian holidays.
King Coloman ordered to settle them to bishopric residences, and to make sealed documents in case of any deals made with them.
In the 1220s they were attacked partly because of their role in royal financial matters, partly in concert with the resolution of the 1217 synod of Toledo.
Béla IV appointed the royal treasurer to be the judge of Jews.
In 1251 a royal charter assured their personal defence and the defence of their properties. It also regulated their obligations concerning taxation.
As a result of Saint Stephen's converting work Christian conversion was quite successful among the Hungarians.
The weakening of the pagan belief is shown by the fact that the 1046 pagan riot led by Vata - which broke out because of King Peter's violent methods - was not against the Christian belief, but against the Christian system of institutions and the Christian social order.
In 1060 Béla I could easily suppress Vata's son's, János's revolt.
At the end of the 11th century making sacrifices at wells was in fact - though in principle forbidden - tolerated.
Though western historiographers described Hungarian Christianity negatively still in the middle of the 12th century - because of political reasons - but conversion of the population to Christianity was actually completed in the country by the end of the 11th century.
Immigrants might have caused some problems concerning Christian conversion.
At the end of the 11th century the Pecheneg settlers, who came in small groups, soon assimilated into the Christian culture.
The Cumans, however, who were received into the country in 1238-1239 by Béla IV in one unit, stuck to their old religion for four decades, and only Ladislaus IV's Cuman Laws ordered their conversion.
The most significant remain of Christian conversion by Byzantine rite was the name of the Transylvanian church district, which was organised in the territory of tribe of the one-time "gyula".
This did not receive its name after its center, but after the territory itself, in accordance with Greek traditions.
Although Byzantine rite did not have the necessary social base in the age of the Árpád dynasty, monasteries were founded for the members of the royal family who supported the Byzantine rite.
The Veszprémvölgy nunnery was founded for Prince Emeric's fiancée, and the Oroszkõ of Tihany for Andrew I's wife.
The Greek precedents of the monastery of Szávaszentdemeter and the archbishopric of Bács became the victims of the spread of Latin church organisation.
However, around 1204, there was a possibility to organise all the Hungarian orthodox believers into one independent church district, but the reason for this was rather the temporary termination of the Byzantine Empire.
At that time the nomadic population, who came from the Balcans, did not built temples yet.
As there were no more believers, Greek church institutes were taken over by Latin priests and monks.
The first inheritors
The first chapters of St Stephen's Exhortations to his son, Prince Emeric, and indirectly to all his successors, were dedicated to the question how a king should be related to the church and ecclesiastical people, and what a big patience is needed to convert people.
His first successor, King Peter, however, did not take his advice at all.
After the model of the German emperor, he made the church pay taxes, and replaced two bishops during the very first years of his reign.
The violent method, by which Peter tried to apply western patterns in Hungary made church people worry.
The bishopric board - with the lead of Gerald - acted against him, and declared him unsuited to the throne.
They wanted to expunge even his memory, so the foundation of the chapter of Óbuda and the constructions of the Pécs Cathedral was attributed to someone else.
Peter's successor, Samuel Aba, ruled in accordance with the expectations of the bishopric board in every aspect.
The eloquent testimony of his ecclesiastical measures is that he sent the bishops he appointed up to Rome.
Secular dignitaries objected to him because he tried to accomplish the regulations of the Early Church concerning communal property during his reign. It was very similar to the patriarchal relations of the age of Christian conversion, when poor members of clans were protected by belonging to the clan.
The bishopric board, however, supported king Aba till his defeat at Ménfõ. After his death the king was buried in a monastery at Sár, and the news about him being a saint also spread.
The events which put an end to King Peter's second rule showed that the fear of the bishops was not at all unfounded.
With the lead of Vata from Békés a pagan revolt triumphed over the rule of the tyrant. A lot of bishops and clergymen died as a martyr in this battle - so did Bishop Gerald.
Only those three bishops survived who supported Andrew I - who suppressed the pagans -, as Mór, bishop of Pécs appointed by St Stephen.
The ruler, who restored the Christian order, received the adjective "Catholic" later, but the Chronicle mentioned that the reason he did not have any grandsons was that he let Christian priests killed at the beginning of his rule.
There were no objections against King Andrew's strict measures. This fact shows that paganism was only a concomitant of the events then.
One of Andrew's famous orders was that people had to keep a three-day fast before St Peter's celebration (June 29).
His younger brother, Béla I's laws concerned the church as well. He ordered to change the date of markets, from Sunday to Saturday, to protect the significance of the Christian holiday with this.
The Consolidation of the New Belief
Andrew I's death lead to a fight for the throne, and this was a good chance for the Pope to intervene in the home matters of the country. By supporting the ruler, he tried to carry out his plan, namely, that Hungary should accept the superiority of the Holy See.
Pope Gregory VII supported Géza and Ladislaus against Salamon.
In his letter to Géza, written in 1074, he explained that God took the reign from Salamon and transferred to them, because Salamon supported the emperor and so he caused grievance to St Peter (translatio regni).
Meanwhile Géza refused the Pope's demands in a very polite way in St Stephen's larger legend. According to this - through St Stephen's offer - Hungary became Virgin Mary's heritage, and Mary preceeds Peter in the hierarchy of the Saints.
During the reign of St Ladislaus, then his successor, King Coloman the Christian belief and institution system were finally stabilised in Hungary.
It was shown by the growth of church organisation and the fact that ecclesiastical jurisdiction became more intensive, which determined the forms of the Christian way of life.
In some measure Ladislaus reorganised the existing church districts (for example, he moved the residence of the Bishop of Kalocsa to Bács, and that of Bihar to Várad), he attached the newly-conquered territories, Slavonia and Croatia, to the country by organising a bishopric in Zagreb.
The new church district - its bishop was a Czech prelate appointed by the king - was supervised by the only archbishopric, that of Esztergom.
The necessary service books were also brought to Zagreb from Esztergom.
The southern bishopric got under the supremacy of Kalocsa only after giving an archbishopric status to the bishopric of Kalocsa.
1083 was a significant year in the life of the Hungarian church, when under the order of King Ladislaus - and surely without the approval of Pope Gregory VII - King Stephen and Prince Emeric (at Székesfehérvár), Bishop Gerald (at Csanád), the hermits of the Vg valley - Zoerard-Andrew and Benedict - (at Nyitra or Zobor) were canonised.
Ladislaus had a synod called together at Szabolcs in 1092.
The king and his counsellors took measures in questions urged by the reform papacy, like the celibacy of priests, restoring old churches and building new ones, and the keeping Sundays and holidays strictly.
Concerning church disciplines, he regulated the receiving of immigrant priests, the paying of church tithe, and marriage affairs were put under the authority of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
Among the forty holidays discussed at the synod of Szabolcs we can find the celebrations of the first Hungarian confessor and martyr saints, like King St Stephen (August 20), Prince St Emeric (November 5) and St Gerald (September 24).
BETWEEN THE EMPEROR AND THE POPE
Coloman and the Church Reform
During King Coloman's reign, around 1104 and 1112, there were two (clearly ecclesiastical) synods held at Esztergom.
With Archbishop Lõrinc as chairman, and his ten bishops participating, the synod focused on making church disciplined stricter.
It regulated the most important duties of priests, it banned pagan rituals for believers, protected ecclesiastical property against the encroachments of the prelate.
It also took measures about church government and the celibacy of priests, the way of life, economic and social situation of canons, monks and village priests and also the order of services.
He put the crime of bewitching, magic and adultery under the authority of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
The second synod of Esztergom made celibacy stricter, and it ordered - for the first time - that marriages be performed in churches.
The first canons of the second synod at Esztergom declared crimes against the king as crime against religion, which should be punished by excommunication.
The king's rights concerning church government were also uncurtailed then. Around 1113, in case of the foundation of the bishopric of Nyitra - started by King Ladislaus - Coloman acted without the approval of the Pope, like his predecessor in case of Zagreb.
The king answered Pope Orban II's letter, in which he demanded obedience to the Holy See, in St Stephen's third legend.
In this Bishop Hartvik approved King Coloman's right for governing the church in historical aspects - inbedded in the theory of sending a crown by the Pope.
His theory (supporting the Sicilian ruler) guaranteed a special situation for the Hungarian king throughout the 12th century. The Pope could not send a legate to the country without his permission, and the Hungarian clergy could keep in touch with the Holy See only with the approval of the ruler.
Though in 1201 Pope Ince III gave permission to use the Hartvik legend as a reading in St Stephen's office only with the restriction that he took a part out of it - namely the one according to which St Stephen could take measures in church matters using "both of his rights" -, the Hungarian ruler's demands for being an apostolic king were still existing in the 13th century as well.
In 1238, during King Béla IV's Bulgarian military campaign, the king asked the Pope to let him use these rights in the conquered territories: an apostolic cross should preceed him, and he wanted to establish the church organisation freely.
The century of the Monks
The most outstanding feature of the history of the church in 12th-century Hungary was the appearance of various monastic orders.
The 11th century was the time of Benedictine supremacy.
The basic structure of Hungarian monasticism was just in the making then: monasteries were founded privately, or by the king.
After King St Stephen almost each Hungarian ruler founded his own monastery, which became his burial place later in most of the cases. Andrew I was buried in Tihany in 1055, Béla I in Szekszárd in 1061, Géza I in Garamszentbenedek in 1075 and Ladislaus I in Somogyvár in 1091.
In the first half of the century secular dignitaries expressed their religious beliefs by giving donations to monasteries, but later they also founded monasteries to guarantee their salvation and a burial place of their own. Bailiff Otto from the Gyõr clan founded a monastery at Zselicszentjakab in 1061, Peter from the Aba clan in Százd, on his estate near the Tisza river, in 1067.
The Premontre canons settled down in Váradhegyfok during the reign of Stephen II, whose aim was to perform pastoring duties.
The Cistercians, who reformed the Benedictine way of life strictly, and who played an important role in the spread of modern agriculture and Gothic culture, were invited to Cikador, near Bátaszék, by King Géza II in 1142.
However, they settled down in a greater number only during the reign of King Béla III. The monasteries of Egres, Zirc, Szentgotthárd, Pilis and Pásztó were founded then, and they became the parent monasteries of later abbacies.
The special characteristic feature of the spread of the new orders in Hungary was that the majority of Cistercian houses were transferred to Hungary directly from the most significant French parent-houses, eliminating the German mediating monasteries (for example, Cikador was transferred from Heiligenkreuz).
The other local characteristic feature was that the spread of orders was in inverse ratio compared to that of Western Europe: the Cistercians, who were very popular in the west, had only about 20 monasteries in Hungary, while the Premontrians established about 40 parent-houses.
While the Cistercians were not very keen on taking up the advowson of secular estate owners, and they belonged under the patronage of the king almost without exception, the Premontrians accepted dependence on secular persons and their advowees were buried in their churches unimpededly, in contrast with the Cistercians.
The growth of the prestige of the country in the 12th century showed that Christianity became stronger in Hungary.
It revealed itself in the fact that both the Pope and the German emperor claimed the support of the Hungarian ruler.
After the double pope-election of 1159 King Géza II first took sides with Frederic Barbarossa, but after 1160 - under the influence of the Archbishop of Esztergom - he consistently supported Pope Alexander III, like his successors, till his triumph in 1177.
The debate between Archbishop Lucas and King Béla III was the starting point of the competition between the two archbishoprics: Esztergom and Kalocsa.
In the first decades of the 13th century Esztergom finally became the leading archbishopric of the country. Its position is first mentioned in sources in 1239.
Lucas might have had a role in founding the St Thomas prepostery in Esztergom, as it was named after his one-time school-mate, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket.
In Hungary the orders of knighthood were represented by the Johannites of Esztergom since 1147, and by the knights of the church of Vrána since 1169. They played an important role in sick-nursing and fighting.
Religious ideas gained strength, which was shown by the fact that Hungary joined the fights for the liberation of the Holy Land through the crusades.
In 1217 King Andrew II lead the fifth crusade, and both orders took part in it, as in the battle of Muhi in 1241 against the Tartars.
By the end of the 13th century the number of Johannite houses was around 30.
The members of the German order of knighthood spent the shortest time in Hungary.
King Andrew II entrusted the Barcaság to them in 1211, but because of their strive for independence the Hungarian ruler was forced to chase them away from the country in 1225.
The Johannites of Esztergom was an order founded in Hungary, but besides their main monastery they had houses in the Holy Land as well (in Jerusalem and Akkon).
The Organisation of the Church
The turn of the 12-13 centuries brought the growth of the church.
The ruler established two preposteries around 1186 and in 1198, in Szeben and Szepes, for the Saxons who settled down in Transylvania.
The bishopric of Milko was organised by the Dominicans in 1228, who converted the Cumans, while the bishopric of Syrmia, approved in 1229, was founded privately by Ugrin Csák, the Archbishop of Kalocsa with the aim that it should stop heresy coming from the Balcans.
When the Dalmatian region and the southern ends were permanently owned by Hungary, the Bosnian bishopric - with the residence of Diakóvár - and church district and bishoprics in the Dalmatian Spalato also joined the Hungarian church.
By the 13th century the network of parishes was established in the country.
IN THE SHADOW OF THE PAPACY
New Monastic Orders
As an answer to poverty at the urban settlements of the 13th century an new monastic movement was born: the begging orders.
In 1221 Paulus Hungarus, the dean of the university of Bologne, participated in the ceremony at the foundation of the Dominican order. He became the leader of the first group sent to Hungary.
The number of their houses, after Gyõr and Székesfehérvár, reached ten by the time of the Tartar Invasion.
The first house of the Franciscans was founded by a German province in Eger; by 1233 their houses in Hungary were organised in separate garrisons, by 1238 in separate order-provinces.
The third order, which played an important role in Hungarian history, was founded in Hungary. It was the Paulian order.
Bartholomew, Bishop of Pécs, collected the hermits of Jakab-hill into a monastery in 1225.
In 1250 he founded a monastery near the village of Kesztõc, in the honour of the Holy Cross, for the hermits living in the Pilis mountains.
In 1256 he named them the order of Hermit St Paul.
To the urging of St Thomas Aquinas, Pope Alexander IV acknowledged the new order.
Under the influence of begging orders and economic changes the monastic orders were pushed back, the great age of the Benedictine and the Cistercian orders came to an end around 1240.
Legates in Hungary
During the 13th century papacy, which gained strength in the investiture fights, had a great influence throughout Europe.
At Pope Ince III's repeated invitation, in 1217 political interests forced King Andrew II to complete his fathers promise for a crusade.
In the middle of the 1220's the Pope worked out the theory of inalienation of royal properties - in opposition to the wasteful estate policy of the Hungarian ruler.
This served as a base for King Béla's policy to take back royal estates.
During the century two papal legates visited the country.
In 1233 Jacob of Pecorar, Bishop of Palestrina, made a deal with the ruler in the forest of Bereg, and made him promise to keep the basic privileges promised in 1222 (ecclesiastical persons belonging to ecclesiastical courts and immunity from taxes), and he guaranteed the salt-monopoly of the church.
Pope Nicholas III sent Philip, Bishop of Fermo, to Hungary to restore the king's reputation and solve the problem of the pagan Cumans.
After settling the Cuman question legate Philip called a synod together in 1279 in Buda, the aim of which was to guarantee the liberty of the Catholic belief and church and improve the way of life and morals of both ecclesiastic and secular people.
Church and Society in the Age of the Árpád Dynasty
The structure of Hungarian church orders became stabilised during the 13th century.
It was headed by the board of prelates, who had the same rights as the secular barons, and they formed the majority of the royal council. Under them stood the chapters with their preposts and the abbots of monasteries.
The middle layer consisted of the canons, who could afford to study at foreign schools and quite often they were members of the royal chapel.
Parish priests and pastors, benefice-priests - who substituted canons in the choir - and choir priests, who all had very low income, belonged to the lower layer of the church.
The prelates and prestigious monasteries had huge uninheritable estates.
Church estates were scattered estates, the work organisation of which - with servants grouped according to their services - guaranteed a dynamic development in the early period.
However, in the 13th century secular estates took over the leading role, and the scattered ecclesiastical estates were on the decline.
Meanwhile the role of priests became fixed in public life, too.
The synodic courts of the Coloman age had already shown that secular society claimed the church taking up public roles.
Bishopric residences, which played important roles at red-hot iron trials, gradually began to perform written duties in the countryside.
The first institutes of it were the great residential chapters and royal preposteries (Veszprém, Székesfehérvár, Gyõr, Esztergom and Buda). They were followed by monastic convents, the Benedictine and the Premontrian, form the 40's of the century.
Theoretically at the end of the 12th century the question of appointing prelates was solved, but in fact the ruler had all the means to help his candidate to the bishopric chair.
Besides centralising church disciplinary matters into the papal High Court of Justice, this was still a difficulty in the relation between the Holy See and Hungary.
Since Béla IV did not get any serious help from the papacy in the course of the Tartar Invasion, he reproached the head of the Church.
The vital force of Hungarian Christianity is shown by its missionary activities.
The Dominicans undertook the search for the Eastern Hungarians and the conversion of the Havasalföld Cumans. The King took the responsibility for organising and supporting converting work in the Balcans, and creating the structure of the church.
Till the age of Ladislaus IV the pagan Cumans provided the possibility for inner missions.
The reputation of the Archbishop of Esztergom seemed strong already in the 1230's, and in the second Golden Bull, in 1231 he received the right for resistance.
From the middle of the century he tried to provide priests for the church at synods.
The archbishop was the first person, who had an important role in secular government as a prelate - he became the perpetual bailiff of castle district Esztergom.
At the end of the century the personality of archbishop Lodomer shows most clearly the place and role of the Hungarian church in society.
The Archbishop of Esztergom took the lead of the ecclesiastical movement, which undertook the reorganisation of Hungarian society - weakened in the age of Ladislaus IV - following the most modern European models, that is transferring early feudalism to Hungary.
The death of Lodomer in 1298 was symbolical: it closes the first period of the history of the Hungarian church.
HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY
THE HUNGARIAN KINGDOM AND ITS NEIGHBOURS
The picture of the country
The general picture of Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty can be drawn with the help of several complementary descriptions.
Three of them are from the middle of the 12th century.
In 1147 the German bishop, Otto from Freising, marched through the country with the participants of the Second crusade, and in one of his works he recorded his experiences in Hungary.
Another traveller, the Muslim Abu-Hamid al-Garnati stayed in Hungary between 1150-1153.
The third description originates from the Sycilian Arabic geographer, Idrisi, from 1154.
And there is another work, entitled "The Description of Eastern Europe", which was written by an anonymous author in 1308.
All of them characterise the kingdom of the Árpáds in concert as a wealthy country, rich in natural treasures.
Because of the fertility of the land in the country, hunger was very rare in this region - by comparison with Western-European conditions.
There were natural resources lying deep in the soil.
Silver mining was quite significant; its early centers were in Selmecbánya in the Highlands, and in Radna in North-Transylvania. The blooming of gold mining dates back to the 14th century.
Besides precious metals mainly iron and copper were excavated.
Apart from metals the most important product of mining was salt - essential as a spice and preservative.
The most significant salt mines were in Transylvania and in the possession of the king, but the church also had a big share from the profit of salt-trade.
The neighbours
The territory of Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty was identical with the Carpathian Basin.
Its borderlands, however, were uninhabited during the 11-12th centuries, their population started only at the end of the age.
The Western neighbour of Hungary was the German-Roman Empire (born in 962), Austria and Styria.
In the north-west the country was bordered by Moravia, which belonged to the Czech state as a province of the Empire.
In the north it was bordered by Poland, to the east by the Kievian Russia.
After the fall of the latter one Halics (Galicia) and Vladimir (Lodomeria) became the closest Russian principalities.
East of the Carpathians was the steppe, where various nomadic peoples followed one another.
From the middle of the 11th century the Cumans ruled this territory, which was named Cumania after them in the 13th century. In the 14th century two Rumanian principalities, Moldavia (east of Transylvania) and Snowland [Havasföld] (south of Transylvania) emerged here.
The southern neighbour of the country was Bulgaria first, later the Byzantine Empire (which incorporated Bulgaria), and from the beginning of the 13th century besides the newly-risen Bulgaria two south-Slav states: Serbia and Bosnia.
We are going to discuss the south-western neighbour, Croatia later.
THE GOVERNMENT
The court and the bailiff districts
Office-holders, who belonged partly to the court, partly to certain institutes of regional administration helped the king in governing the country.
In the first type the palatine was the head.
In the 11th century the holder of this office - as the bailiff of the court - performed economic duties, but by the 13th century he had become a judge, whose share of competence expanded over the whole country.
His economic duties were undertaken first by the bailiff of the royal court, and then - when the holder of this office became a judge under the title of 'country judge' [országbíró] - his duties were taken over by the Treasurer in the 13th century.
At the same time the table-bearer, the stableman and the cup-bearer also appear at the court.
The holders of these offices were appointed from among the dignitaries enjoying the support of the king, and they were members of the royal council, which had the right to make decisions in political matters.
Other royal office-holders stood at the head of different bailiff districts.
Royal servants responsible for special services (for example, the stablemen) lived in a separate bailiff district. Court bailiff districts were organised around different royal courts; castle bailiff districts were organised around royal castles.
These latter ones were the local units of the royal castle district system. The estates of this, creating smaller or bigger groups, formed an incoherent big manor land together with the bailiff castles. These were usually strengthened by entrenchments with wooden structures in the 11-12th centuries and served as centers.
The majority of castle bailiff districts belonged to different counties, so the office of the bailiff counted as a baron honour.
The institution of the counties
Counties were the basic institution of regional administration in the country.
The first counties were formed at the time of the foundation of the state, in concert with local conditions.
Counties expanded over the power district of royal castles, but they were not identical with castle bailiff districts, as the territory of a county included the royal, church and secular private estates within its borders, besides local castle bailiff districts.
However, the person directing the local castle bailiff district was identical with the county bailiff, who directed the county, and also had double responsibility and power over military, legal, economic and managing matters.
This early type of county is usually called royal castle district; it was governed by its bailiff through the institutions of the local castle bailiff district.
The institution of royal castle districts was followed by the so-called 'noble castle districts' in the last third of the 13th century.
During the 13th century due to big land gifts the system of castle bailiff districts collapsed and the free land owners, who gained noble rights, got out of the juristic power of the county bailiff through royal servant statuses.
As a result the traditional process of county administration could not be continued.
As a solution, four chief magistrates, who were chosen from among local noblemen, were appointed to help the county bailiff. This kind of county authority became responsible for the matters of the people in the county - till the end of the 14th century for the non-noble, too.
The provinces
Controlling the counties a separate government was established in two parts of the country: in Transylvania with the lead of the voivode, in Slavonia with the lead of the ban.
Originally in the early times the Transylavanian voivode was the bailiff of county Fejér, which expanded over the whole of south-Transylvania. His juristic power expanded over the other Transylvanian counties by the middle of the 13th century.
As the governor of the king, the voivode had juristic, military and economic power.
The ban directing the medieval Slavonia in the western part of the territory between the rivers Sava and Drava had a similar role.
Both the voivode and the ban belonged to the group of barons sitting in the royal council.
In the 13th century more ban districts were formed along the southern border of the country, from among which Macsó and Szörénység were the most significant ones.
From the turn of the 11-12th centuries on medieval Croatia - the land between the Dinarian Alps and the Adriatic Sea belonged to the kingdom of the Árpáds.
The country of the Croatians - who belonged to Slav people - was conquered in 1091 by St Ladislaus, and Hungarian rule was stabilised by king Coloman, who had himself crowned as Croatian king in 1102.
Croatia could keep its own social and institutional system, but until 1918 the authentic Hungarian ruler bore the title of 'King of Croatia', later without even separate coronation ceremony.
So Croatia - together with Slavonia - was governed by the bans beginning from the 13th century.
FOREIGNERS IN HUNGARY
Settlers from the East
A lot of ethnic groups lived together in the territory of Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty.
Some of these - for example, different Slav groups, or fragments of the population in the Avar age - were found living in the Carpathian Basin by the Conquering Hungarians, while other groups moved into the country in the course of the 10-13th centuries.
It is also not doubted that the conquering Hungarians did not form a homogenous group of people concerning their ethnic origin and their language: the basic Finno-Ugric population formed a political unit, the hétmagyar [Seven Hungarians] tribal alliance, including fragments of peoples speaking various Turkic and Iranian languages.
Part of the settlers came from the east, including the Muslims of different origin, who were called either Ismaelites (or Böszörménys) or Káliz-s in Hungary.
Part of the Ismaelites were soldiers, others were tradesmen or experts in economy.
Their significant groups lived in the Nyirség (north Hungary) and Szerémség (Syrmia).
The first Ismaelites might have come to the Carpathian Basin together with the Hungarian conquerors, and there is data about their immigration even from the middle of 12th century.
11th century laws tried to stop their religious separation, but in spite of these some of their communities survived until the middle of the 13th century, and assimilated to Christian Hungary only after this time.
The Pechenegs - who spoke a certain type of Turkic language - belonged to these early settlers.
During the 10-12th centuries the Petchenegs, who settled down in smaller or bigger groups, lived in Fejér and Tolna counties in significant numbers.
Part of them assimilated to the Hungarian population quickly, but other groups preserved their ethnic identities by living in independent bailiff districts even in the 14th century.
Jews had already been living in the Carpathian Basin in the 10th century, although data about them increased only from the end of the 11th century.
The majority of them dealt with trade and financial matters.
In 1251 king Béla IV enacted a separate law to regulate their situation in the country.
In the middle of the 13th century fragments of the Cumans - a people who spoke a Turkic language - immigrated to the country.
After the Tartar Invasion the Cumans nomadised in the territory between the rivers Danube and Tisza and around the Körös rivers and the Maros river. They preserved their pagan traditions for a long time in spite of the regulations of the 1279 'Cuman Law'.
After 1270 the authentic palatine was the chief authority for them.
Their residences were not divided into counties; so by the 15th century these developed into special independent ethnic governments, the so-called 'Cuman Chairs'.
Presumably the first group of the Jas people, originating from Iran, - who are mentioned in Hungarian documents from the 14th century - came into the country together with the Cumans.
The Rumanians appeared within the borders of the Hungarian Kingdom in the 13th century.
Ancient Rumanian people, who spoke a neo-Latin language, can trace back their origin to the Balcanian peninsula to the 1st milleneum AD.
The nomadic Rumanians, who were called 'vlach'-s in Slav and Byzantine sources, appeared first in Transylvania at the turn of the 12-13th centuries.
Their first groups settled down in south-Transylvania in the Fogaras region, after the Tartar Invasion they also lived in the borderline of Bihar county, though only in small numbers.
Their immigration continued in later centuries in the Middle Ages.
The Magyars of Eastern Transylvania [= the Székelys] were considered as a different ethnic group in the Middle Ages. Their independence was shown by their peculiar institutions and traditions.
The origin of the Székelys, appearing in the 12th century, is not clear from the written sources.
According to one theory they are the predecessors of the fragments of the Bulgarian-Turk Eskil tribes, who had joined the Hungarians in the Eastern-European steppe. They might have assimilated to the Hungarians well before the Conquest.
As there is no evidence that the Székelys spoke any other languages than Hungarian, other expert say that they were organised from different Hungarian groups, and the idea of their ethnic independence was formed secondarily.
The Székelys appeared at several places in Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty.
Besides the western borderline and Szabolcs and Baranya counties, their most significant early settlements were around Telegd in Bihar county.
In Transylvania they were first mentioned at the beginning of the 13th century, but there might have been Székely settlements in south-Transylvania already in the 12th century.
The majority of the Székelys were settled down in the territory of today's Székelyföld [Székelyland] around 1200 to defend the border. A separate Székely bailiff district was organised for them, which did not belong under the supremacy of the Transylvanian voivode.
The special institutes of Székely administration, the so-called "székely chairs" developed here by the 14th century.
The archaic social system of the Székelys survived throughout the Middle Ages.
Settlers from the West
Other groups of foreigners, who immigrated to the country arrived from the different regions of Western-Europe, and they were called 'hospeses' in the first place.
Part of them were called "Italian" (Latinus) - this expression referred to people who spoke neo-Latin languages, so besides the Italian it applied to the French and the Vallons as well.
As a result of their immigration from the middle of the 11th century significant Italian settlements were formed around Sárospatak, in Syrmia and in the Eger region.
The majority of the Italians settled down as farmers.
At some bigger settlements (for example, Esztergom, Székesfehérvár), however, Italian trade-colonies were also found.
These latter hospes communities were the buds of Western-type urban development in Hungary.
The other considerable group of settlers spoke German, and they were called "Saxons" collectively.
Their settlement might have already started in the 11th century, but their two bigger residential territories - in Transylvania and in the Szepesség - were formed only from the middle of the 12th century on.
Saxon bailiff districts - independent of the supremacy of the voivode - were organised in four regions in Transylvania: their centers were in Szeben, Brassó, Radna and Beszterce.
The forming of a local Transylvanian Saxon government was made possible by a letter of privilege, called the "Andreanum" - issued in 1224 by Andrew II -, which contained the rights and obligations of the Saxons of Szeben.
The majority of the Transylvanian Saxons earned their living by agriculture, and their leaders were called "gerébs".
Some of those who settled down around Radna were miners in the local silver mines.
Among the Saxons of the Szepesség we can find both peasants and miners.
The first groups of the local German population were followed by a bigger wave of immigrants after the Tartar Invasion.
In the second half of the 13th century the Saxons of Szepes lived in an independent Bailiff district, and their situation was regulated by Stephen V in a letter of privilege similar to the Andreanum.
After the Tartar Invasion Slavs came to the Szepesség in bigger numbers.
Their settling down was organised by the "soltész"-s, and the Czech, Moravian and Polish settlers merging with the native Slavs formed today's Slovakian people.
SETTLEMENTS AND PLACES OF HABITATION
Roads
The regions of the country were connected by roads, and the continuation of these outside the borders connected the Hungarian Kingdom to the surrounding world.
Giving up the isolation of the 10th century St Stephen opened a road, which connected Western Europe with the Holy Land through Byzantine, in 1018. This road crossed Transdanubia, touching Gyõr and Székesfehérvár, and it led to the Balkans.
The "big roads" that played important commercial and military roles, started from a triangle marked by the early royal centers - Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and Óbuda -, this is why this region was called the "center of the country" even in the early times - in accordance with its actual geographical situation.
Idrisi had a valuable description of the early road system.
In his work he mentioned four main roads.
One of these shows the route of salt transport in Transylvania, through the stations of Gyulafehérvár, Csanád and Csongrád.
The road to Kiev touched Vác, Eger and Ungvár, while the main points of junction towards Byzantine might have been Bács, Titel, Keve, Barancs and Nagyolaszi.
It is worth mentioning that the road towards the West, which followed the line of the Danube was relatively unsignificant in Idrisi's description.
By the second half of the 13th century this situation changed.
The role of the earlier central region was taken over by a single town, Buda, which was founded right after the Tartar Invasion, - and its "twin-town" on the other bank, Pest. So the six main roads of the country started from here.
During the 13th century the importance of the Kievian and Byzantine trade partly stopped, partly significantly declined due to the political events occurring in the neighbourhood of the Carpathian Basin.
Their places were taken over by Western-European connections, and according to these the roads, which led there, became the main arteries of transport.
Villages
Villages were smaller settlements of the population dealing with agriculture.
This type of settlement was characterised by various forms and dynamics in the age of the Árpád dynasty.
In the age of the Conquest the Hungarians led a nomadic economy and way of life.
Families established their winter residence at a permanent place for years to survive the cold season.
These winter residences were maintained by some related families and surrounding it they had their own cultivated lands.
The Bulgarian-Turk loan words of the Hungarian language refer to the fact that not only corns but also vegetables were grown there.
Winter residences became the buds of later villages, as only some appointed men followed their animals to new grazing grounds from spring to autumn, and not the whole family.
After the foundation of the state the organisation of the castle district system and the secular and church estates urged permanent settling down.
The written sources of the 11th century reflect the total lack of nomadism, but the views of Western European witnesses might have played an important role in this, too.
In St Stephen's and St Ladislaus's laws and in 11th century deeds of gift the place of living of common people was exclusively the village (villa) with fixed borders.
Traces referring to clan relations are missing from these sources, but the villages had their leaders, similarly to later centuries. It was the village chief or as he was later called, the judge (villicus).
On the base of modern (Bashkirian, Kazah, Kirgizian) ethnographical parallels we can suppose that they might have changed grazing grounds then, but only within the fixed borders of the village.
At springtime when the animals were driven out afield, only part of the population of the village followed them.
In the majority of the villages in the age of the Árpád dynasty animal husbandry might have been more important than agriculture, though these two branches of farming were usually practised within the boundaries of the same family estate, and they supplemented each other.
In this semi-nomadic farming system tamed domestic animals around the house played a very important role.
Without manuring the cultivated lands soon got exhausted, so they tried to fill up the place of their earlier villages and cultivate those.
As a result of this their winter residences, the earlier villages, had to be moved so that they could cultivate the fertile land on the place of the old residences.
The historical projection of this phenomenon was St Ladislaus's law, which bans the moving of villages far from churches.
The archaeological trace of cyclically moving villages is the fact that we can find the place of at least 8-10 settlements from the Árpád age within the administrative borders of a settlement of today.
This is called wild, or in other words, unregulated soil-changing system.
Until the middle of the 13th century there were no basic changes in this system, only the number of settlements increased.
Due to this process the number of big villages on plains decreased, and from the end of the 12th century the settlement of mountain regions in the east and north borders of the country started.
Villages differed in size: the population of a village fluctuated between 16 and 65 families, the most common was 20-25 families in a village.
The size of a village was also influenced by the juristic position of the population.
From among the people of royal and church estates those who were in charge of agricultural or handicraft industrial services lived in bigger villages, while those who were responsible for military services had much smaller settlements.
Besides these there were detached settlements consisting of one or two houses, and a small, special type of settlement, called "predium".
This latter one was usually a farming center owned by a secular landlord populated with slaves.
The structures of Árpád age villages were basically defined by their natural environment.
They were usually established near lakes or rivers, but on flood-free highlands.
The selection of the place of villages was not only motivated by the supply of water nearby (though dug wells were quite rare at that time).
Fishes caught in the river or lake were important food; reed and sedge cut on the shore were important building materials.
The network of roads did not attract villages.
The ground-plan structure of winter residences and villages can be sketched on the basis of archaeological findings.
The place of settlement was usually huge.
On these early settlements houses, yurts, kilns and pitfalls were seemingly scattered, "in bushes".
Residences were usually around pinfolds and system of pitfalls established for keeping animals; residential objects were in the corner of the enclosed parts.
Apart from farming, the life of villages was basically defined by the fact whether they could become the center of the region or not.
Settlements lying around roads, ferries or those having a church had a better chance.
One of St Stephen's laws ordered that every ten villages should build one church.
Till the end of the 13th century half of the settlements in the developed parts of the country had their own church buildings, while in other parts of the country only one fifth of the settlements had their own church buildings.
From the end of the 12th century peasant artisans appeared in villages, who met the demands of the local people.
Villages usually had a smithy, craftsmen working with leather and wood were very rarely needed at that age.
Pottery was popular, it depended on the fact whether there were clay-pits in the neighbourhood.
The housing culture of common people was quite different in the country.
Living in tents was rather general till the middle of the 12th century as the survival of traditions brought from the South-Russian steppe.
Felt yurts were used only in warmer periods of the year, while in winter they lived in pit-, mud-, or harrow-houses.
In 1147 Bishop Otto from Freising described the homes of Hungarian commons like this: "Since in their villages and settlements there are quite poor houses made of reed, rarely wood, and sometimes stone, in the summer and autumn they live in tents".
Yurts were much more comfortable than pit-houses, because of the bigger inner space and better ventillation.
It is wrong to believe that the spread of pit-houses showed a more modern housing culture.
Pit-houses were small, dark and smoky, they had only one advantage: their walls and roofs were easy to build using materials (trunks, branches of trees and reed), which were available at winter residences - and besides this they might have been warmer than yurts.
The use of felt yurts had a very important disadvantage, namely that almost a herd of sheep were needed to maintain them because of the continuous supply of felt.
According to archaeological findings the basic type of a village houses was the small (3 meters by 3 meters) pit-house dug in the ground.
Its roof structure was supported by at least two forked posts, and in one of the corners there was an oven built from clay or small stones.
Due to the small size of pit-houses people lived there only temporarily, in the cold seasons.
When it was possible, they stayed in the open air or in the outbuildings.
Besides the pit-house dug in the ground common people owned an oven in the open air, some storing pits, occasionally buildings for keeping animals and some temporary buildings.
The small size of pit-houses did not allow common people to live together with their domestic animals.
From the documents about Margaret's (of the Árpád dynasty) canonisation it is known that around 1250 from the families of common people only the wife and two children could sleep in the house, the husband slept in the open air, near the animals.
From this very same source we learn two other important facts.
One of them is houses in part of the villages may have been scattered.
According to a common man, who described the miraculous case of his child resurrection, he said that their nearest neighbour lived at an arrow's shot, that is at least 100 meters from their house.
The other fact is that a neither rich nor poor free common family might have lived at three different places in a few years' time, which refers to a rather large mobility.
The picture of the village described above started to change in the middle of the 13th century.
In the next one and a half centuries a significant part of the villages became deserted.
Earlier this process was explained by the Tartar invasion.
Today the social changes of the Árpád age are considered the primary reasons.
This process was urged by the tragic 1241-42 years.
However, some of the villages became bigger.
In this change besides the natural environment (configurations of the land and water supplies), the influence of the road system is the most important factor. Although bigger buildings, like churches, mansions, also influenced the topography of the settlements.
In these settlements an outer field also belonged to the house.
Soil changing farming was beginning to spread.
The place of living also changed: instead of pit-houses more-, usually threefold peasant houses were in use, which was so convenient that it remained popular till recent times.
Towns and fortresses
The buds of Hungarian towns appeared already during the reign of the first kings of the Árpád dynasty.
Then a significant part of the country was covered with marshes, farming was limited to a small region, and due to its primitive forms it could not provide for a great number of citizens moving into towns.
As a result of developing commodity production, more and more places of towns appeared in the second half of the 11th century.
At the weekly markets regulated by the king's laws agricultural products and simple industrial products (like textile, shoes) were exchanged.
The important commercial roads ensnared the country in east-west and north-south directions.
The first Hungarian urban settlements were formed along these roads.
In the middle of the country (medium regni), from the Danube bend to the north-eastern shore of Lake Balaton, there were only huge forests.
In this period of time forests provided protection, building material, fuel, food (mushrooms, fruits, game); this latter is very important, since the domestication of animals was not as wide-spread as it is today.
It is not by chance that the early Hungarian royal castles, mansions, towns, and monasteries founded by kings were built in or around forests (Pannonhalma, Tata, Esztergom, Dömös, Visegrád, Óbuda, Fehérvár, Veszprém, Pilis).
There is relatively little information about the structure and ground-plan of early Hungarian towns.
Hungarian kings stayed mostly in Esztergom till the 13th century.
St Stephen was born here. He thought it was important to found an archbishopric in this town, to make it a national ecclesiastical center.
At Fehérvár, at St Emeric's birth-place, King Stephen rebuilt the royal residence founded by his father, and established a royal castle and palace here.
The basilica founded by him was the scene of coronation ceremonies, royal weddings and christenings, and the earthly remains of several Hungarian kings are also placed here, next to St Stephen's tomb.
During the St Stephen days' law days the king had always stayed here, as we can read it in the laws of the Golden Bull.
In Óbuda a settlement was formed around the royal mansion, and later, from the 13th century another one was formed around a castle.
The ecclesiastical center of the town, the building complex of the prepostery, was situated in the northern region; and there was a market nearby, and the church and monastery of the Franciscans, near St Peter's church.
Part of the first Hungarian towns were formed in the place of ancient Roman settlements, or above their ruins.
In some cases only the favourable possibilities for settlements (availability of water, forests, good defence possibilities, the easily recyclable building materials of the Romans) urged people to build their towns onto Roman ruins.
Such places were Szombathely (Savaria), Gyõr (Arrabona), Pest (Contra-Acquincum), Esztergom (Solva), Kolozsvár (Napoca).
Some new settlements, however, used the existing, partly ruined buildings.
According to certain theories the chief prince of the conquering Hungarians, Kursan, having crossed the Danube (he went to the Buda side) with the ferry together with his soldiers, established his fortress in an ex-amphitheatre.
The road network of Óbuda was built following the road system of the old Roman castrum.
The bailiff center of Visegrád was protected by the walls of castrum Pons Navatus, and the medieval town of Sopron was surrounded by the walls of the old Roman Scarbantia.
The road network of the castrum of Pécs (Sopiane) also had an influence on the development of the structure of streets in the medieval town, which was built on this site.
The survival of Sopiane in the Middle Ages was guaranteed by its tomb chapels, which stood even in the Middle Ages.
These tomb chapels were also sacred places of pilgrimages in Europe, and several settlements were founded around them.
Pécs might have been one of them, as its medieval name shows (Quinqueecclesiae, Fünfkirchen).
Medieval towns of Roman origin developed from market places crossed by commercial roads, or ports on rivers suitable for shipping (Pest, Óbuda, Esztergom), or partly they were newly founded towns (like Fehérvár).
The settling down of foreign tradesmen - Muslim Kalizes and Jews -, and a migration due to a demographic growth in the middle of the 12th century, and the appearance of foreign settlers - Latins, Germans - provided the population of these settlements.
The development of Hungarian towns was urged by their urban rights, the enrichment of their citizens and the development of handicraft industry.
Nevertheless, the population of early towns was also engaged in agricultural activities - for example, grapes were grown at Fehérvár, and fishing was quite general in Esztergom.
From among early Hungarian towns there were several ones without a fortress, such as Pécs, in the territory of which there was a bishopric castle and palace surrounded by a mound Pest might have been like this, too, in the 12th century.
Towns with two poles were Gyõr, Nyitra, Vác or Kalocsa, in the territory of which the settlement was located under the bailiff or bishopric castle (11 bishopric residences).
In Gyõr the secular center protected by a mound and pitfall gave home to the bishopric palace and church.
There were towns with many poles, like Fehérvár, where around the early royal castle and palace, and the prepostery, which were protected by a wall (a building complex, which contained the royal basilica named after the Virgin Mary) there were at least three settlements.
These early towns - from today's modern point of view - may have been village-like settlements with one main street.
The dwellers were tradesmen, castle villeins, servents and serfs.
Settlements belonging closely to the nucleus of the town were surrounded by a bunch of settlements (Gyõr, Esztergom, Fehérvár, Veszprém).
Contemporary commercial centers were also formed (Fehérvár, Esztergom, Óbuda, Pest), in the center of which there was a marketplace, though there might have been more marketplaces in the territory of these towns.
At Fehérvár we clearly see the structure of the early town.
In the heart of the town there was the marketplace, in the south the early royal castle and palace, in the east the building complex of the prepostery with the royal basilica.
East of this latter one the villeins of the prepostery lived around the church of the Holy Cross; castle-villeins might have lived in the north-west side of the marketplace, around St Bartholomew's church, while the St Jacob church in the north side of the marketplace may have been the church of the settlement of the tradesmen.
In the royal castles of early towns there were churches and chapels next to the palace.
The residences of watchmen and the stables might have been there, too.
The basic area of the early royal castle of Fehérvár was about 5.200 square meters, which is nearly the same as the basic area of contemporary royal castles.
The beauty of palaces in early royal castles can be admired on carved stone fragments, and ground-plans, and besides these in the Esztergom castle.
In ecclesiastical centers fortified by walls there was a palace, a church, and a monastery - following the pattern of the royal basilica of Fehérvár - on the southern side of the church.
The canons lived alongside the passage, and also the school and the guest house were here.
The basic area of the building complex surrounded by a wall was nearly the same as that of the enlarged early royal castle (about 20.000 square meters).
The building of fortresses in Hungary may have started already in the middle or end of the 10th century, in the course of which a lot of earth-fortresses were built in the territory of the country.
Fortresses built on strategically important places, on islands risen from rivers and marshes, peninsulas or foothills might have been protected by moats, and their fortifications were usually made of wood.
These early fortresses guaranteed the protection of the borders, or they were clan or bailiff centers.
In the 12-13th centuries new earth-fortresses were built, but this time their ground-plan was round or oval.
With the construction of these natural protective borderlines (like steep mountain sides, the cut in horizontal mountain ridges) were made even safer.
In the center a living tower or a farm-building was built, which was usually made of durable materials, like brick or stone.
Relatively early, already in St Stephen's age there might have been several stone fortresses in Hungary, and the number of these may have grown in the beginning of the 13th century.
In 1242, besides Esztergom and Fehérvár, the fortresses of Veszprém, Tihany, Gyõr, Pannonhalma, Moson, Sopron, Vasvár, Németújvár, Zalavár, Léka, Pozsony, Nyitra, Komárom, Fülek and the fortress of Abaújvár without a stone wall proved to be so strong that they resisted the siege of the Tartars.
Some of the fortresses were of Roman origin: for example, Visegrád (Pons Navatus).
The most typical characteristic feature of Hungarian stone fortresses was that they were built on places which were difficult to reach (Detrekõ).
Several fortresses were surrounded by a moor (Fehérvár) or they were built at the meeting of rivers (Adorján, Újvár).
In the course of the building program following the Tartar Invasion, in Béla IV's age, several royal and private fortresses were built from stone, with relatively high walls.
These were divided by towers of round, square or semi-circle ground-plans.
Such town walls protected the fortified Hungarian towns (Fehérvár, Esztergom, Pest, Buda).
Gates were fortified by separate towers.
In the suitable corner of towns surrounded by a wall Hungarian royal (secular) or ecclesiastical fortresses were built, which were separated from the town.
Sometimes they were even surrounded by a ditch (Fehérvár, Buda, Kõszeg, Vác).
Within the town walls, on the corners of fortresses there might have been towers built (Kõszeg, Fehérvár).
Hungarian towns surrounded by stone walls were built as a result of the Tartar Invasion, not long after they appeared in Western Europe.
Fehérvár, Buda, Nagyszombat, Pécs, Kassa, Eperjes, Kõszeg received their walls at that time.
The extension of towns was defined by the number of their citizens, the importance of their position in trade, their defence possibilities, and last but not least their natural environment (in case of Fehérvár the edge of the marsh).
Accordingly the ground-plan of Hungarian towns was either triangular, square or round.
Some of the suburbs outside fortifications received mounds made of earth or wood, or ditches (Fehérvár) not long before the Tartar invasion. Later certain suburbs were surrounded by stone walls (Sopron), while many suburbs - extended on big territories - remained totally unprotected.
Within the walls the system of streets was formed.
In the middle of the downtown of Fehérvár, which was built according to plans, the ancient marketplace survived.
To the north and south of this 3 streets were built, which were divided by cross-streets.
The system of streets was usually irregular, but in many places they were built according to plans.
The forms of these plans were various.
Marketplaces were formed at the widening part of important commercial roads, they may have had funnel-shaped or square ground-plans.
Next to them the town hall and the church - characteristic of the marketplace - were built.
The various monastic orders also appeared in towns: the Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustine hermits and carmelites, and the Franciscan (Clarrissan) and Dominican nuns.
Their monasteries, as there was no room in the downtown area, were built in the suburbs.
In the towns there were irregular streets, blocks of houses among squares, within these the plots had irregular ground-plans and they were of different size.
Citizens of different nationality lived in different streets or squares (Magyar street, Latin street, German street, Jew street), who assimilated to the Hungarian population by the end of the 15th century, or by Hungarian citizens moving into these streets, they became dominant.
The name of these streets may refer to the profession of the dwellers (Baker street, Canon street).
Streets were also named after saints or the church in the street (St Peter street, St Anne street, St Nicholas street).
The name of the street could also refer to its size, age or importance (Main street, Big street, Old street), or it could show the owner (Canon street) or its function (Market square, Wheat market, Fish market).
Different from the 11-12th-century houses, which were dug into the ground, made of wood or mud, stone houses were built in streets and squares after the Tartar Invasion.
The inner and outer side of the wall of the house were made of bigger stones.
The part between the two stone lines was filled by mortar of smaller stones.
Walls made of yellow, brown or white mortar were 80-120 cm wide, so one or two-storey buildings, sometimes with cellar, could be built.
The corners of such houses were made stable by corner-quoins.
Early town buildings were usually built with an axis at right angles to the street, but in later centuries the front of streets were built in with houses almost everywhere.
Early houses, which consisted of two side rooms and a kitchen in the center with a free chimney, were enlarged following the cellular system: towards the yard and in the street front.
Their floor was a simple terazzo floor, though at some places there was a brick floor, or a floor of planks.
There are several medieval houses today in Buda, Székesfehérvár, Pécs and Sopron open to the public.
WAY OF LIFE
SOCIETY
The freemen and the servants
The first and foremost principle, which governed Hungarian society in the age of the Árpád dynasty was the possession or lack of freedom.
Accordingly the people of the country were divided into two main groups: the freemen and the servants.
Servants were their owners property.
However, their position was not identical with that of the antique slaves, because they were considered as persons - in concert with Christian teachings.
The freemen were their own masters: they were not the property of others.
The border between the freemen and the servants was rigorous, but not impossible to cross.
The freemen could lose their freedom (for example, a punishment), and servants could be freed by their owners.
In the age of St Stephen the freemen were divided into three groups.
The dignitaries, who consisted of the remainders of the layer of old chieftains and knights immigrating from the west, were called "bailiffs" by Stephen's laws.
The middle layer included the group of "warriors", the members of which were connected with a fighting life style.
They were soldiers serving other people or persons who had their own properties.
The lowest layer of the freemen consisted of "people from the mock" or "common people".
However large were the differences within the society of the freemen, their rights were identical. The poor had the same rights as the most powerful dignitaries.
Nobility and limited freedom
There were big changes in society by the last quarter of the 11th century.
The layer of dignitaries, who had special privileges, separated from the juristically homogeneous group of the freemen.
They were called "the noble", while the layer of common free people were called "the non-noble".
As not all the noble people were rich, there were big differences among the common freemen concerning their financial conditions.
The wealthy common people owed military service to the king, so King Coloman exempted them from paying the tax called "the denariuses of the freemen".
But the commons who cultivated the land of other people had to pay this tax.
The fate of land owners and the commons, who did not have any properties became different from this point.
A completely new form of liberating servants appeared in these decades.
This - in contrast with the practice used in St Stephen's age - did not provide the privileged ones the rights of those who were born free, but it guaranteed more favourable conditions for servants.
Those who had these privileges were also called freemen, but as they were not allowed to give up their duties arbitrarily, they were in fact servants.
Their freedom was limited. To differentiate between the real freemen and the privileged servants, the freedom of people who were free from restrictions was called "complete" or "golden freedom".
Thus the society of the servants became divided similarly to that of the freemen.
A special group appeared in Hungary at the time of St Stephen, who were called "guests", or in Latin "hospes"-s.
Originally these guests were foreigners, who wanted to settle down in the country.
The majority were farmers coming from various regions of Western-Europe, who settled in and cultivated deserted areas under certain conditions.
Juristically they were free with special privileges.
They could keep their traditions in their new homeland, and their communities had local governments with limited rights.
They were the elite layer of the peasant society, and during the 13th century more and more local peasants lived according to hospes rights.
There were three types of landed property in Hungary in the age of the Árpád dynasty: royal, ecclesiastical and secular (private).
Within royal estates we can differentiate between the system of castle districts providing military and public duties and the system of estates serving the king and his court.
The Queen's and princes' estates preserved for the members of the royal family have common features with the latter one.
On all these types of estates lived a great number of servants and common people with restricted rights.
The situation of certain groups - within the borders of common rights - changed in various ways, depending mainly on whose property they belonged to.
The world of servants
The servants of royal estates all belonged to the layer of servants.
Some of their groups were known by the services they performed (for example, stablemen, bison-hunters...etc.).
The most typical group of servants on royal estates were called "equerries" and their castle districts were districts "of castle people".
The taxation and administrative units of royal servants consisted of either ten or a hundred people.
Their direct leaders were the free equerries with limited rights or they were appointed from among the castle villeins.
These latter ones were in the best situation.
They were in charge of directing castle people and battles, and the majority of them were wealthy and respected land owners.
The servants on ecclesiastic estates all belonged to the possession and under the authority of the land owner, and they were categorised according to the services they provided, similarly to servants on royal estates.
The hierarchy among ecclesiastical servants was formed on the basis of services, depending how respected or inferior they were.
At the bottom of this hierarchy stood those who dealt with ploughing and wine growing.
Next came the craftsmen: carpenters, goldsmiths, smiths and so on.
The chiefs, who directed the work of servants, were the most respected. They were called villeins on the ecclesiastical estates, too.
Their duties were not so hard, and the armed escorts of bishops and abbots were appointed from among them.
The groups of servants on secular (private) estates were differentiated according to juristic categories.
The reason for this was the fact that the rights of the owner were different over people living on his land.
Common servants were those over whom the landowner had unlimited power.
These servants did not even have their own tools.
They worked with the tools and animals of their owner.
The group called "libertines" in Latin was in a more favourable situation. They were servants who worked on independent farms.
Free people also lived on secular estates; there were liberated servants among them just as common free people who did not have their own lands.
Royal servants and noblemen
This layer of Hungarian society of the Árpád age underwent significant changes during the 13th century.
The name royal servant - appearing at the beginning of the century - originally referred to those people who were liberated from royal estates by the king himself and presented with land property.
Their social status was actually the same as that of the free owning land property. As a result of this the two social layer fused.
Many of the elements of the rights of royal servants were included in the 1222 Golden Bull.
These privileges included some of the privileges of the nobility to show that the rights of royal servants were of higher quality than those of the common freemen (free peasants).
The owners of smaller estates, who were called royal servants at the royal court, in the possession of their privileges considered themselves equal to noblemen.
This conception - extending the term noble to themselves - was gradually accepted. Royal power accepted the noble rights of royal servants only in the 1267 law.
The social and financial situation of the new nobility, consisting of dignitaries and royal servants, and consequently their way of life was rather heterogeneous.
People originating from royal servants, who were ennobled by rulers as a reward of their services also joined the layer of nobility.
The development of the layer of peasant villeins
The other trend of change in the 13th century concerned people who were servants.
From the middle of the century the significance of servants on secular estates decreased in contrast with the libertines and the freemen.
The increased demand for work force after the Tartar Invasion enabled the gradual fusion of these three layers. Servants either escaped from their owners and performed peasant duties at their new places as free hospeses, or the owner himself liberated his servants in order to be able to keep them.
By the end of the 13th century the layer of free peasant villeins was formed on secular estates.
The peasant villein was a free man who had the right to move. He paid tax to his landlord on the basis of his farming activity. He was connected to his farm by rights, for example, he could leave it to his sons.
The peasant community of a settlement could have a restricted local government with an elected judge at the lead.
As a remainder of power over servants the juristic authority of the landowner over his servants was preserved, the institution of this was the so-called noble court of justice. The duties of peasant villeins developed from the duties of the libertines.
The development of the peasant villein layer in the age of the Árpád dynasty took place only on secular estates: the people of royal and ecclesiastical estates remained in the bonds of dependence from the owner till the end of the 14th century.
ECONOMY
Agriculture
The majority of the population of the country was engaged in agriculture.
This was also the daily activity of the greater part of people living in towns and of servants, who dealt with another kind of industrial activity besides this, such as coopers, locksmiths.
In the agriculture of the Árpád age the 13th century was a big turning point.
By comparison with the beginning of the century agricultural production changed throughout the country by the end of the century. As a result of this there were changes in society and in settlements with effects lasting till the 18th century, or even till 1848 in many cases.
The dry, warm European climate since the 8th century, changed in the 12th century. It was only interrupted by a colder period in the 10th century, the rainy, cool so-called "small ice-age" of 50 years.
The eluding plough appeared in Hungary in the 13th century, which was very effective. Used together with the asymetric ploughshare, the furrow splitter and the controlling board it turned the soil over - in contrast to earlier ploughs, which could only scratch the soil - so it enabled a better exploitation of the ground.
Greater production results could provide for a bigger population.
There was a big increase in population in Western-Europe in the 12th century, and people began to migrate to deserted areas within and outside their countries.
In the first half of the period the unregulated soil-changing system was in use, and this brought about the movement of settlements within the borders of the village.
The servants of secular estates lived in praediums, that is in small settlements. Besides the mansion of the landlord some servant houses and farm buildings - deepened into the ground - also belonged to these small settlements.
Within a village there might have been several such praediums.
In the central area of the country people turned to a regulated soil-changing system in the 13th century.
As a result the places of patches became fixed, and the word patch had two meanings: in a narrower sense it was the house and the yard, in a wider sense it was the garden, field and hayfield as well.
The grazing grounds, forests, and sources of water of the village remained in common use.
The migration of places of villages stopped.
In the first period grain crops brought the double of the seeds sown, in the second one the amount of seeds was three or four times bigger.
Only a little amount of fruit was grown, and mainly the ecclesiastic estates took the lead in this activity.
The most important vegetable was the cabbage.
Grapes were grown everywhere except in the Great Plain and on higher mountain regions.
From the 13th century wine-yards were considered as private properties: regions where grapes were grown were considered as cut-over areas similarly to lands cultivated by hospeses. Those who cultivated them had more rights for these than for plough-lands, for example.
The cutting over and settlements in mountain regions, and borderlands started at the beginning of the 12th century, but it accelerated in the 13th century. Instead of regulated soil changing and in the lack of plough-lands grain crops were grown at the backyard, behind the house. This territory was always under cultivation and fertilisation. Only one and the same family used it.
The division of plough-lands was not in fashion here.
There were two ways of cutting lands over: people either took off the bark of the tree and let them dry out - thining the woods -, or they burnt it down.
In Hungarian agriculture animal husbandry played a bigger role in the Middle Ages than it did in the West.
The significance of horse-keeping gradually decreased.
In the first half of the period only small cattle were bred. Presumably the Cumans brought the ancestors of big grey cattle to the Carpathian Basin.
The proportion of swine in the live-stock gradually increased, the majority of them were kept in forests eating mast.
Sheep played an important role in the supply of food.
In the southern and eastern border lands of the country people, who lived according to the so-called vlach rights, dealt with transhuman animal keeping.
This kind of farming led to the development of scattered mountain settlements.
Craftsmenship
Besides animal husbandry and farming the third most important branch of economics in the age of the Árpád dynasty was craftsmenship.
Its origin is multifold.
On the basis of loan words some crafts must have already existed before the Conquest, so there must have been some common craftsmen among the conquering Hungarians.
Archaeological findings from the 10th century proved the existence of other crafts than those which were needed for the war industry - like the making of weapons and harnesses - or gold smithery.
Certain traces suggest the existence of crafts (e.g.: pottery, skin dressing or fur dressing), which could scarcely be done under classical nomadic circumstances.
After the foundation of the state the structure of Hungarian handicraft industry also changed.
According to written sources from the 11-12th centuries products of handicraft industry were made in royal, ecclesiastic or secular estates within the bounds of the servant-system, first and foremost to supply the estate.
The forming of this system can be explained by the undeveloped road network and trade.
The owner of the estate settled down the craftsmen in bigger groups, sometimes all of them lived in the same village, and they were forced to turn out not only agricultural products but also products of the handicraft industry. (This can be traced in place names, which refer to different trades: e.g.: Tímár [skin dresser], Szakácsi [Cook], Esztergár [turner].)
Legally craftsmen did not separate themselves from the commons, and they were mostly servants.
Owing to the scarce number of written sources many details of the servant-system are still unknown, and there must have been differences among the various estates.
In spite of this, craftsmenship could only be a secondary profession among craftsman servants besides farming and other services (such as transporting, stable services).
The majority of craftsmen worked with their own tools, so they could sell the surplus goods, that remained after delivering the compulsory quota of handicraft products.
Sources prove the existence of markets in Hungary since the beginning of the age of the Árpád dynasty.
Certain craftsmen did not belong to the cast of servants even in the 11th century.
Masters usually lived in busy county centers and they satisfied the special or luxurious demands of the dignitaries or the royal court (gunsmiths, goldsmiths, coin minters).
In these city-like centers craftsmen of the same profession lived in separate groups, in independent parts of the settlements.
There were masters who travelled from town to town.
Their special skills and knowledge (e.g.: moulding of bells) rather belong to architecture than handicraft industry.
Change in the servant-system started in the second half of the 12th century by the immigrant hospeses, the majority of whom were artisans.
So the development of handicraft industry and trade accelerated in communities presented with royal privileges.
In the 13th century realisable agricultural products became more and more important for big estate owners, so they urged their craftsmen to deliver these.
The escape of artisan servants to cities was a further sign of the decline of the servant-system.
Archaeological findings also show this transformation in the handicraft industry: From the beginning of the 13th century in the more developed regions of the country consumer goods made in villages could be differentiated from consumer goods made in cities (e.g.: iron knives, pots).
The process of the development of handicraft industry in cities was accelerated by the destruction of the Tartar Invasion in 1241-42.
In the course of the "fortress building rush" in the age of Béla IV many towns managed to obtain royal privileges, which provided the favourable circumstances for craftsmen, just as elsewhere in Western Europe.
The grouping of craftsmen of the same trade began in the second half of the 13th century, first of all to guarantee the good quality of goods.
This concerns especially the food industry. Guilds were formed later, in the 14th century.
Town-like settlements which could not manage to obtain royal privileges - for example, bishopric residences or boroughs - remained in the possession of the estate owner, who frequently helped their craftsmen with various privileges.
In villages, however, handicraft industry was pushed back; it just satisfied local demands, so it was not rare if there was only one smithery in a certain village.
In the 11-13th century different branches of smithery were significant in the handicraft industry: with the development of these various new agricultural equipments, tools, weapons and jewels were invented.
In the 10-11th centuries in Hungary iron was melted in two smaller geographical regions: around Miskolc and Ózd in the northern mountain region, and in western Hungary around Sopron and Vasvár.
The conquering Hungarians smelted iron in smelting-furnaces, which was unknown in their new home before.
As part of this technology, smelted crude iron had to be made incandescent many times, then hammered to remove the dross from it.
Smithery separated from iron-smelting already in the 10-11th centuries.
Smiths were very important people among servants in the age of the Árpád dynasty, especially those who were skilled in making weapons. These smiths were the best in producing steel, and in running together harder and softer layers.
When smithery was divided into further independent trades, many new trades were born in industry: the profession of makers of steelware, gunsmiths, swordsmiths, knifesmiths, locksmiths, armourers, shoeing-smiths and nailsmiths.
Specialising did not take place in the villages; most villages did not have any forges till the end of the Árpád age.
Smelting bronze was in between smithery and jewellery.
On the one hand its masters usually dealt with making jewels: they made the simpler versions of expensive jewels from bronze.
On the other hand they were the makers of many liturgic devotional objects: candle sticks, smokers, crosses.
Relic holder crosses - which were significant from the point of view of industrial art - however, were not the works of Hungarian masters, they originated from Byzantine import.
The most beautiful objects of medieval bronze-smelting were the so-called aquamaniles. They were water-pouring dishes with representations of different animals and imaginary creatures.
Some of them must have been imported to Hungary from the region of the rivers Rhine and Maas.
The first monumental objects of bronze smithery were the bells, which were smelted by travelling masters.
The two earliest bells were smelted in the 11th century: the bell of Csolnok and Ruzsa.
The most highly respected craftsmen were smiths in the Árpád age, partly because of the value of objects made by goldsmiths, partly because their customers often belonged to high-society.
Smiths who worked at the royal court were also important people: minters of coins, and makers of citing stamplers and seals were appointed from among them.
Of course, not all the smiths worked for dignitaries: part of them dealt with the mass-production of jewels worn by common people.
Relations throughout Europe, the so-called migration of motifs, can easily be noticed in the smithery of the Árpád age.
But it is often difficult to decide whether the most outstanding pieces of smithery (e.g.: the jewels found in the territory of the palace of Esztergom or the royal basilica of Székesfehérvár) were made in the country or brought into the Hungary through trade relations.
In the field of wood-work we can find only carpenters in the servant-system of the Árpád age.
Besides the roof structures and walls of churches and houses of dignitaries, the so-called cassette wood-frames of mounds were also made by them.
The making of carts might have been an independent industry at that time.
The traces of this industry could be noticed at Kocs in Komárom county in the Árpád age. The name 'kocsi' [cart] - a special version of carts - comes from this place name.
Shipwrights and coopers making various types of wooden dishes also existed in this age.
Skills in wood-working were needed in the course of the production of several types of weapons, tools and harness accessories.
Furniture as such must have existed in the 11-12th centuries - first of all in the houses of the wealthy, though chests were generally used by common people since the beginning of the Árpád age.
Carpentry became an independent trade only in the 13th century due to the development of city-like centers.
In the structure of the servant-system a lot of data refers to skin dressers, fur dressers, shoe makers.
Leather works were very important in a lot of territories of industry. Besides leather armours there were leather clothes, shoes, harnesses and straps.
Concerning early tanning techniques the Hungarians used fat and alum in tanning.
The latter was used together with ground seeds and the derivatives of milk making.
The so-called 'Hungarian leather', tanned with alum soaked in warm fat, was very famous throughout Europe. This kind of leather was used for making harnesses.
The word-stock of weaving-spinning in the Hungarian language originates from Slav loan words. It reflects the fact that certain techniques were adopted from Slavic people only after the turn of the 9-10th centuries.
The relative undevelopment of this industry suggests that there was a significant textile import to Hungary up to the end of the Middle Ages.
There were no craftsmen making soft materials to meet luxurious demands.
For example, the textile of the coronation cloak - the first unbroken Hungarian piece of clothing - is Byzantine silk embroidered with golden thread.
First the monastic orders adopted the western techniques (the first mill was built in Locsmánd, which functioned between 1206-18), and later western hospeses joined them.
Cotton industry, spinning wheel and pattern-weaving was also introduced by them.
Clay pots were used for cooking and frying in the 10-13th centuries in Hungary.
As pots were cheap and fragile they were found at archaeological openings in great numbers.
In the first half of the Árpád age potters functioned within the servant-system.
Potters appeared in cities only at the turn of the 13th century.
Their work was also of better quality.
New techniques were adopted from the west, so they spread in Sopron and Pozsony near the western border first.
The master started to imitate the so-called Wiena pots, while masters in villages only did so later.
Money and trade
The economic life of the Árpád age, especially in the first two centuries of the kingdom, was based on natural farming.
The main characteristic feature of this was the striving for self-sufficiency. As a result, certain servant groups, who worked on different - royal, ecclesiastical and private - estates were forced to deliver a fixed quota of their surplus handicraft or other special products(for example, honey, wax...etc.).
The fact that besides paying this kind of tax they also worked on the fields to provide food for themselves and their families shows the low level of division of labour.
Natural farming, however, was not a completely closed system, so money, goods and trade played an important role since the beginnings.
The minting of coins in Hungary started in the reign of St Stephen.
Minting money was a royal prerogative. Besides the ruler only those princes could mint money who had independent territorial rights.
Minting money and related matters connected to that belonged under the authority of the royal chamber, which must have been located in Esztergom till the middle of the 13th century.
After this coins were minted in other regions of the country in the name of the king (for example, in Slavonia; this money was called the denariuses of the ban).
The necessary precious metals were provided by the royal silver mines.
The profit from minting coins came from either the decrease of the amount of precious metals in the coins or from the so-called innovation of money, which guaranteed profit for the chamber.
The money in public use could return to the royal chamber in several ways.
Already St Stephen began to impose taxes on his people, which might have been the predecessor of the royal tax called the denariuses of the free, regulated in details in King Coloman's laws.
Extraordinary tax was first imposed on people by Andrew II and his model was followed by his successors, too.
Besides national taxes, there were local taxes at certain places, for example the beech-skin tax in the territory south from the river Drava.
People paid their tax in money as well as in products. For example, the Petchenegs and Székelys gave horses instead of money.
Different customs duties were also royal incomes similarly to taxes.
Originally they belonged under the authority of the king, so the incomes of these enriched the royal chamber.
In some cases, however, rulers gave donations from the incomes of customs duties. First only ecclesiastic institutions were given these donations, then, in the course of the 13th century, private people as well. By the end of the age of the Árpád dynasty a great amount of customs duties was in the hands of private people.
Customs duties collected from transportation (ferry, bridge and road customs duties) and commerce (market customs duties) concerned first only the quantity of goods, later, after King Béla IV's 1255 reforms, they concerned the value of the goods, and the amount of customs duties were defined as surplus goods.
Markets guaranteed a great part of customs duties. The existence of such markets is proved by data from the 11th century.
The spread of these markets is reflected among others in place names - (for example, Vásárhely [Marketplace], or names referring to the day of the market, like Szerdahely [Wednesday place], Szombathely [Saturday place]...etc.). Weekly markets were probably held near bailiff centers, too.
In the place of some significant market places -connected to ecclesiastic celebrations - yearly or country markets were held, which attracted sellers and customers from far regions.
The giving up of royal customs duties of the market led to the birth of so-called free markets. The permission for these became one of the elements of privileges given to hospes communities and towns during the 13th century.
A document from the end of the 12th century gives a priceless summary of royal incomes. This may have been made for a foreign royal court, possibly in connection with Béla III's second marriage.
The inventory gives the sums in mark, which was an exaggeration according to general opinion. However, the composition of incomes and the proportions of the different items of incomes compared may reflect a real situation.
According to this, the most important source of income was minting money (about 37%), followed by the incomes of customs (19%) and the incomes of the counties (16%). The ratio of the rest of the items remained under 10%.
The inventory also contains the incomes of Hungarian prelates.
Foreign trade was an organic part of economic life in the age of the Árpád dynasty, even within the boundaries of natural farming.
Till the 13th century Hungary might have had serious relations mainly with the East - Kiev and Byzantium. The signs of joining Western-European economy are quite significant from the second half of the 12th century, and by the 13th century trade with the West became dominant.
The main items of export - besides agricultural products - were slaves and animals, especially horses. 11th century laws contain some regulations in connection with their export.
The majority of imported goods were products of the handicraft industry and luxury items (Expensive textiles, jewellery, spices), just as in later times.
During the 13th century the main trend in foreign trade turned towards the West.
Besides the traditional goods of export Hungary began to export precious metals (especially silver, gold, copper and tin).
The great majority of import goods remained the products of handicraft industry and luxury items, but the proportion of cheap iron products and textiles increased significantly.
The circle of participants in trade also changed: while earlier mainly eastern tradesmen (Jews, Ismaelites, in a smaller proportion Greek and Georgian people) played an important role in commerce, in the 13th century more and more western tradesmen (mainly German and Italian) came to the country and settled down, and also Hungarian tradesmen joined this circle.
Domestic trade in the age of the Árpád dynasty meant the exchange of products of different regions, so the majority of goods were agricultural products.
The most important and earliest item of trade were wine and salt.
Later, with the development of agriculture, grain-crops also became important items of trade. From the second half of the 13th century grain-crops granted the supply of the developing cities.
The products of Hungarian handicraft industry were items of every-day use, so it met the demands of basic needs.
The inner exchange of goods was settled by Hungarian tradesmen, the places of these exchanges were cities, around which local markets began to develop.
EVERYDAY LIFE
Men's clothes and weapons
Various types of hatchets were quite effective - first of all for the infantry - against armoured troops.
Loan words 'battle-axe' (bárd: 1214) and 'bill' (topor: 1235) appeared in the Hungarian language since the beginning of the 13th century.
The wrestling scene on the wall-painting of the St Ladislaus legend from Gelence/Ghelinta refers unmistakably to the role of the first mentioned weapon. In this picture the girl is cutting the Cuman's hooked sinew on a battle-axe - the weapon of the St king, which became a permanent detail of his later representations.
After discussing weapons we are going to continue with the introduction of the horse and harnesses of warriors.
As a result of the development of weapons bigger horses appeared in the Carpathian Basin from the third of the 10th century.
The armoured warrior sat on a big horse in a saddle, which was quite specific, different from eastern type saddles. Both pommels of the saddle arose high into the air.
In this high saddle horsemen sat with straight legs at first, but later with legs stretched forward.
In the 12th century, when the role of spear attacks became very important, deep knight saddles with pommels surrounding the waist of the horseman appeared to avert strong crashes and provide a suitable stay.
Harnesses were decorated with mounts, fringes and bobtails, but on the harnesses of the above mentioned wall-painting the golden dots of mounts were painted onto the straps as well.
The use of spurs became wide-spread in heavy cavalry, which was the novelty of the age.
Horseshoeing in Hungary presumably appeared in the 11th century.
Heavy cavalry tried to avoid using it even in the Middle Ages so that they could keep the maximum speed of horses.
A great value was attached to the knight's armour and the horse together. The majority of common landowners did not possess such large estates (400-500 hectares) that would have produced a profit big enough to buy those.
This is why the majority of small landowners - who were forced to take part in military campaigns - remained in the light cavalry then, in the second half of the 13th century. At the very most they could supplement their equipment with a sword or spear, since these proved to be very useful against both heavy and light armoured enemies.
The Pechenegs, the Székelys, the Cumans and the Jász-s - who settled down here in the 13th century - fought only in light armours.
Before discussing their weapons we must talk about their clothing before and after the Conquest.
Presumably these people - who were still pagans in the 11th century - tried to insist on their traditional clothing.
Representations from the 11-13th centuries show shirts with rising collars and a caftan-like tight overgarment reaching to the knees, with long tight sleeves, which was loosely pleated under the belt.
Their clothing always included a belt without mounts.
The legs of the figures of the representations were either bare or covered with tights. They wore boots on their feet.
Although we know that common people wore their hair in plaits - thus they kept the old tradition - for centuries, in the above-mentioned representations they were shown with western-type hairstyle: let down, sleeked hair with shaved faces, or with moustaches and beards.
The survival of eastern-type clothing of the age of the Conquest was guaranteed by the Székelys and Pechenegs and other Muslim (Ismaelite) peoples besides the Hungarians and their military supporters, who assimilated into the country. Later, in the 13th century the settlement of the Cumans and Jász-s brought a new boom.
The overgarment of the Cumans - which can be traced back with the help of 12-13th-century Cuman stone sculptures from the South Russian steppe and the wall-paintings of the St Ladislaus legend - included a caftan reaching to the knees, trousers and boots.
The wings of the loose caftan - which was made of a thick material (in case of dignitaries, Byzantine fabric) - were folded onto each other from right to left in the front and they were pressed down by a belt.
Occassionally the shirt was so long that it hung out from below the caftan.
Cuman warriors used their belts to gather the caftan down and hold weapons (e.g.: hatchet, bow-quiver, quiver) and keep other accessories in (knife, striker, comb, pouch). The belt was usually plain, the only decoration could be the buckle.
Cuman dignitaries, however, laid their claims for belts with precious metal mounts.
The different mounts on these do not show eastern taste, but quite surprisingly, they are connected to court life.
Cuman warriors did not wear trousers, but stockings reaching to the groin.
Their light boots with soft soles reached over the knees.
Cuman men shaved their heads and wore the remaining hair in one, two or three plaits, which often differed in length and thickness.
They had no beards either, but twirled moustaches.
They wore a long, pointed high cap with rolled up edge, the so-called Cuman high cap, which had no fur on it.
This type of clothing became so wide-spread among the Hungarians in the second half of the 13th century that the church tried to ban it twice (1279, 1288) - without success.
Warriors in light armour were also forced to use defensive weapons.
They put on a leather armour to protect their bodies.
Warriors of higher ranks wore wire or scale armours.
They also protected their heads with helmets, which were made of either riveted iron sheets or made of one piece, which were cone-shaped. These helmets ended in a churn, which held the helmet-decoration, or in a small pole, which held a little flag.
They were often made with nose-flaps, or metal masks.
Warriors in light armour hardly ever used shields.
The reason for this was that it impeded the user in handling the bow and the horse simultaneously, as the main attacking weapon was the bow.
Reflex bow types used at the time of the Conquest were preserved in the 11-12th century, though there are no archaeological proofs of this in Hungary.
Concerning the various types of arrow heads, sharp ones, which could pierce armours (arrow heads with three or four edges, pyramidal and spear-shaped) became very popular since the 11th century due to the fact that archers had to face armoured enemies quite frequently.
Besides these flat, leaf-, diamond- and deltoid-shaped or fork-like arrow heads also survived.
From among weapons for close-range fighting we must mention the sabre - though even among the Mongolians only the richest could afford one.
This weapon also underwent a change since the 11th century: a longer, wider and more strongly bent blade appeared.
There was another traditional hitting weapon - which appeared in the Carpathian Basin with Pecheneg or Cuman mediation - the club. Only its sporadic archaeological findings are known.
Clubs were made of iron or bronze in various forms, and they were attached to wooden sticks.
The equipment of light cavalry did not develop significantly since the age of the Conquest.
There is no concrete information about their saddles, but it is sure that curb-bits remained popular.
The warriors' stirrups were decorated with wide, curved stays and round or pointed-round straps - in concert with their boots with soft soles.
Spurs were not used by light cavalry.
After discussing the weapons of heavy and light cavalry we must mention bows.
These threatening weapons were used by the infantry, so it did not belong to the equipment of either heavy or light cavalry.
According to the first data, in 1242 the Spanish Bailiff Simon defended the castle of Esztergom - sieged by the Tartars - with the help of his archers.
In 1265 a source mentioned that horse were shot down with arrows, so this weapon must have been used in Hungary at the end of the age of the Angevine dynasty.
In the history of the Hungarian Kingdom year 1301 - which was quite significant in history - was not very important in the history of weapons and clothing, because the proportion of weapons mentioned above did not change till the end of the 14th century and the development of weapons was not significant either.
Women's and children's clothing
The adoption of Christianity brought significant changes in both men's and women's clothing.
Shirts - which was a typical item of clothing of both men and women -, caftan-like garments gathered with a belt, trousers and richly mounted boots were exchanged by new clothes according to the rules of the new religion. These new clothes had to hide the body.
The closed, cloak-like garment - which was wide-spread throughout Europe - consisted of several layers on top of one another.
The basic wear was an under and over-clothes called tunique. Over this people wore a shorter mantle and a longer, semi-circular cloak.
The several layers of clothes on top of one another were made of the same material, but their colours were different.
The material of the clothes was usually broad-cloth, but it also might have been silk, brocade or velvet brought from the East.
Stephen, the younger king's inventory from 1264 proves that the dignitaries of the country had had their clothes made of the most expensive foreign textiles.
The inventory listed a great amount of Flandrian broad-cloth, Italian, Byzantine and Asian - maybe Chinese - silk and velvet, soft linen for both men's and women's clothes.
These clothes were lined or decorated with expensive furs.
As their names indicated [hajadon = let down hair] single girls wore their hair let down, but married women hid their hair with a kind of bonnet or veil.
The most simple of these was the so-called nun's bonnet or veil, which covered the hair, neck and partly the shoulders. We can see this on the wall-painting of the church of Ócsa, entitled the Last Judgement.
Presumably elderly women and widows wore such veils.
The female donator on the Szentkirály tympanum is wearing a flat, box-like bonnet, which was fastened under the chin. There is a long veil at the back under the bonnet.
This kind of head-dress was very popular among dignitaries. We can see the same on the famous sculptures of female donators from Naumburg (Germany).
Only a few jewels were worn at that time, the most popular ones were buckles for cloaks and clasps.
According to archaeological findings from tombs silver or bronze hair rings were used for gathering hair braids, but necklaces, bracelets, rings were also found.
Their material was usually copper or bronze; only the dignitaries wore silver and gold jewels.
The so-called corolla-belt, worn by girls and married women as well, also counted as a jewel. It was woven from metal or gold threads and it was decorated with metal plates and pearls in most cases.
The head-dress called 'párta' was worn by single girls. Several proverbs and sayings refer to this. For example, "she remained in 'párta'" means that a girl did not marry anyone.
The 'párta' was a ribbon or wreath around the head richly decorated with pearls, plates or precious stones - similarly to belts worn around the waist.
On the basis of written sources it is not certain how wide-spread it was in the age of the Árpád dynasty, but it is proved that it was worn by the fact that pearls and pressed plates were found around the head in tombs.
The most expensive gold jewels were worn by the members of the royal family and court.
These treasures were travelling from one court to another due to dynastic marriages among ruling families. Thus some head-dresses were brought to Poland as King Béla IV's daughters' wedding crowns, which survived from that age. One of them still decorates the St Sigismund herm, while the other two were transformed into a promise-cross.
In the legend of St Elisabeth there is a description that her parents, Andrew II and Queen Gertrude - who was murdered later - set their daughter to Thuringhia with a rich dowry.
Elisabeth was engaged to the son of the Thuringhian marquis as a child, but her dowry - clothes and jewels - did not differ from the clothes of an adult princess.
In the Middle Ages children's clothes did not differ from adults' clothes except in size - independent of financial-social status.
Except for the youngest ones, children wore the same types of clothes as their parents.
